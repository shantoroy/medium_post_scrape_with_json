To hear the blockchain hype train tell it, blockchain will now:Solve income inequalityMake all data secure foreverMake everything much more efficient and trustlessSave dying babiesWhat the heck is a blockchain, anyway? And can it really do all these things? Can blockchain bring something amazing to industries as diverse as health care, finance, supply chain management and music rights?And doesn\u2019t being for Bitcoin mean that you\u2019re pro-blockchain? How can you be for Bitcoin but say anything bad about the technology behind it?In this article, I seek to answer a lot of these questions by looking at what a blockchain is and more importantly, what it\u2019s not.What is a blockchain?To examine some of these claims, we have to define what a blockchain is and herein lies a lot of the confusion. Many companies use the word \u201cblockchain\u201d to mean some sort of magical device by which all their data will never be wrong. Such a device, of course, does not exist, at least when the real world is involved.So what is a blockchain? Technically speaking, a blockchain is a linked list of blocks and a block is a group of ordered transactions. If you didn\u2019t understand the last sentence, you can think of a blockchain as a subset of a database, with a few additional properties.The main thing distinguishing a blockchain from a normal database is that there are specific rules about how to put data into the database. That is, it cannot conflict with some other data that\u2019s already in the database (consistent), it\u2019s append-only (immutable), and the data itself is locked to an owner (ownable), it\u2019s replicable and available. Finally, everyone agrees on what the state of the things in the database are (canonical) without a central party (decentralized).It is this last point that really is the holy grail of blockchain. Decentralization is very attractive because it implies there is no single point of failure. That is, no single authority will be able to take away your asset or change \u201chistory\u201d to suit their needs. This immutable audit trail where you don\u2019t have to trust anyone is the benefit that everyone that\u2019s playing with this technology is looking for. This benefit, however, come at a great cost.The Cost of BlockchainsThe immutable audit trail uncontrolled by any single party is certainly useful, but there are many costs to create such a system. Let\u2019s examine some of the issues.Development is stricter and slowerCreating a provably consistent system is not an easy task. A small bug could corrupt the entire database or cause some databases to be different than other ones. Of course, a corrupted or split database no longer has any consistency guarantees. Furthermore, all such systems have to be designed from the outset to be consistent. There is no \u201cmove fast and break things\u201d in a blockchain. If you break things, you lose consistency and the blockchain becomes corrupted and worthless.You may be thinking, why can\u2019t you just fix the database or start over and move on? That would be easy enough to do in a centralized system, but this is very difficult in a decentralized one. You need consensus, or the agreement of all players in the system, in order to change the database. The blockchain has to be a public resource that\u2019s not under the control of a single entity (decentralized, remember?), or the entire effort is a very expensive way to create a slow, centralized database.Incentive structures are difficult to designAdding the right incentive structures and making sure that all actors in the system cannot abuse or corrupt the database is likewise a large consideration. A blockchain may be consistent, but that\u2019s not very useful if it\u2019s got a lot of frivolous, useless data in it because the costs of putting data into it are very low. Neither is a consistent blockchain useful if it has almost no data because the costs of putting data into it are very high.What gives the data finality? How can you ensure that the rewards are aligned with the network goals? Why do nodes keep or update the data and what makes them choose one piece of data over another when they are in conflict? These are all incentive questions that need good answers and they need to be aligned not just at the beginning but at all points in the future as technology and companies change, otherwise the blockchain is not useful.Again, you may be wondering why you can\u2019t \u201cfix\u201d some broken incentive. Once again, this is easy in a centralized system, but in a decentralized one, you simply cannot change anything without consensus. There\u2019s no \u201cfixing\u201d anything unless there\u2019s agreement from everyone.Maintenance is very costlyA traditional centralized database only needs to be written to once. A blockchain needs to be written to thousands of times. A traditional centralized database needs to only checks the data once. A blockchain needs to check the data thousands of times. A traditional centralized database needs to transmit the data for storage only once. A blockchain needs to transmit the data thousands of times.The costs of maintaining a blockchain are orders of magnitude higher and the cost needs to be justified by utility. Most applications looking for some of the properties stated earlier like consistency and reliability can get such things for a whole lot cheaper utilizing integrity checks, receipts and backups.Users are sovereignThis can be really good as companies don\u2019t like the liability of having user data in the first place. This can be bad, however, if the user is \u201cmisbehaving\u201d. There\u2019s no way to kick out the user that\u2019s spamming your blockchain with frivolous data or has figured out a way to profit in some fashion that causes other users lots of inconvenience. This is related to the above observation that incentive structures have to be designed really, really well in that a user that figures out an exploit is not likely to give that up, especially if there\u2019s profit for the user.You may be thinking that you can simply refuse service to malicious users, which would be very easy to do in a centralized service. However, unlike a centralized service, refusing service is difficult because no single entity has the authority to kick anyone out. The blockchain has to be impartial and enforce the rules defined by the software. If the rules are insufficient to deter bad behavior, you\u2019re out of luck. There is no \u201cspirit\u201d of the law here. You simply have to deal with malicious or misbehaving actors, possibly for a very long time.All upgrades are voluntaryA forced upgrade is not an option. The other players on the network have no obligation to change to your software. If they did, such a system would be much easier, faster and cheaper to build as a centralized system. The point of a blockchain is that it\u2019s not under the control of a single entity and this is violated with a forced upgrade.Instead, all upgrades have to be backwards-compatible. This is obviously quite difficult, especially if you want to add new features and even harder when thinking from a testing perspective. Each version of the software adds a lot to the test matrix and lengthens the time to release.Again, if this were a centralized system, this would be very easy to correct by no longer servicing older systems. You cannot do this, however in a decentralized system as you cannot force anyone to do anything.Scaling is really hardFinally, scaling is at least several orders of magnitude harder than in a traditional centralized system. The reason is obvious. The same data has to live in hundreds or thousands of places than in a single place. The overhead of transmission, verification and storage is enormous as every single copy of the database must pay them instead of those costs being paid just once in a traditional, centralized database.You can, of course, reduce the burden by reducing the number of nodes. But then at that point, why do you need a decentralized system at all? Why not just make a centralized database if scaling costs are the main concern?Centralization is a lot easierIf you notice a theme, it\u2019s that decentralized systems are very difficult to work with, expensive to maintain, hard to upgrade and a pain to scale. A centralized database is much faster, less expensive, easier to maintain and easier to upgrade than a blockchain. So why do people keep using the word blockchain as if it\u2019s some panacea for all their problems?First, a lot of these industries that are being sold on blockchain are really overdue for IT infrastructure upgrades. Health care has notoriously terrible software. Financial settlement is still running on software from the 70\u2019s. Supply chain management software is both difficult to use and hard to install. Most companies in these industries resist upgrading because of the risk involved. There are lots of infrastructure upgrades that cost hundreds of millions and end up being rolled back anyway. Blockchain is a way to sell these IT infrastructure upgrades and make them a bit more appetizing.Second, blockchain is a way to look like you\u2019re on the leading edge of technology. Like it or not, the word \u201cblockchain\u201d has taken on a life of its own. Very few people actually understand what it is, but want to appear hip so use these words as a way to sound more intelligent. Just like \u201ccloud\u201d means someone else\u2019s computer and \u201cAI\u201d means a tweaked algorithm, \u201cblockchain\u201d in this context means a slow, expensive database.Third, people really don\u2019t like government control of certain industries and want a different adjudication mechanism than the legal framework which is often slow and expensive. To them, \u201cblockchain\u201d is really just a way to get rid of the heavy apparatus of government regulation. This is overselling what blockchain can do. Blockchain doesn\u2019t magically take away human conflict.The result is a lot of people that are hyped up on the promises without actually understanding the abilities or costs. What\u2019s worse, the actual technical details and costs are abstracted away from a lot of VCs and executives in such a way as to obscure what a blockchain can and can\u2019t do. Everyone under them become afraid to say that the emperor has no clothes and we have the situation that we have now.So what is blockchain good for?We\u2019ve already established that a blockchain is very expensive relative to centralized databases. So the only reason you should be using a blockchain is to decentralize. That is, remove the single point of failure or control.This naturally means that the software or database must not change things around often, if at all. There should be little upside to upgrading and much downside to screwing up or changing the rules.Most industries are not like this. Most industries require new features or upgrades and the freedom to change and expand as necessary. Given that blockchains are hard to upgrade, hard to change and hard to scale, most industries don\u2019t have much use for a blockchain.The one exception we\u2019ve found is money. Unlike most industrial use cases, money is better if it doesn\u2019t change. Immutability and difficulty in changing the rules is a positive for money and not a detriment. This is why blockchain is the right tool for the job when it comes to Bitcoin.What\u2019s clear is that a lot of companies looking to use the blockchain are not really wanting a blockchain at all, but rather IT upgrades to their particular industry. This is all well and good, but using the word \u201cblockchain\u201d to get there is dishonest and overselling its capability.ConclusionBlockchain is a popular term these days and unfortunately, this \u201cblockchain not Bitcoin\u201d meme won\u2019t die. If you are a centralized service, a blockchain doesn\u2019t get you anything that you can\u2019t do a thousand times cheaper with a centralized database. If you are a decentralized service, then you\u2019re probably fooling yourself and not thinking about the single points of failure that exist in your system. There wouldn\u2019t be a \u201cyou\u201d at all in a truly decentralized service.Biggest joke in this entire articleBack in the early 2000\u2019s, there was a push by a lot of executives in the tech industry to use Java and XML. Despite these two things being tools and not actual products, many executives insisted on their use, no matter how poor the fit was to what their engineers were trying to achieve. Blockchain is very much like that. Focus on the problems you\u2019re solving and the tools will make themselves readily apparent. Focus on tools that you want to use and you\u2019ll end up making Rube Goldberg machines that don\u2019t do anything particularly well.In a sense, current conceptions of blockchain are trying to do the impossible. They want the security of a decentralized system with the control of a centralized one. The desire is the best of both worlds, but what they end up getting is the worst of both worlds. You get the costs and difficulty of a decentralized system with the failure modes of a centralized one.Blockchain is used way too much as a buzzword to sell a lot of useless snake oil. The faster we get rid of the hype, the better off long-term we\u2019ll all be.", "responses": 620, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Bitcoin", "Enterprise Software", "Distributed Ledgers", "Cryptocurrency"]}, {"title": "Learn Blockchains by Building One", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@vanflymen/learn-blockchains-by-building-one-117428612f46?source=search_post---------1", "author_name": "Daniel van Flymen", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@vanflymen", "publish_date": "2017-09-24", "last_modified_date": "2019-08-10", "readtime": "8.49", "claps": 79006, "voters": 11590, "content": "Learn Blockchains by Building OneThe fastest way to learn how Blockchains work is to build oneDaniel van FlymenFollowSep 24, 2017 \u00b7 9 min readYou\u2019re here because, like me, you\u2019re psyched about the rise of Cryptocurrencies. And you want to know how Blockchains work\u2014the fundamental technology behind them.But understanding Blockchains isn\u2019t easy\u2014or at least wasn\u2019t for me. I trudged through dense videos, followed porous tutorials, and dealt with the amplified frustration of too few examples.I like learning by doing. It forces me to deal with the subject matter at a code level, which gets it sticking. If you do the same, at the end of this guide you\u2019ll have a functioning Blockchain with a solid grasp of how they work.Before you get started\u2026Remember that a blockchain is an immutable, sequential chain of records called Blocks. They can contain transactions, files or any data you like, really. But the important thing is that they\u2019re chained together using hashes.If you aren\u2019t sure what a hash is, here\u2019s an explanation.Who is this guide aimed at? You should be comfy reading and writing some basic Python, as well as have some understanding of how HTTP requests work, since we\u2019ll be talking to our Blockchain over HTTP.What do I need? Make sure that Python 3.6+ (along with pip) is installed. You\u2019ll also need to install Flask and the wonderful Requests library: pip install Flask==0.12.2 requests==2.18.4 Oh, you\u2019ll also need an HTTP Client, like Postman or cURL. But anything will do.Where\u2019s the final code? The source code is available here.Step 1: Building a BlockchainOpen up your favourite text editor or IDE, personally I \u2764\ufe0f PyCharm. Create a new file, called blockchain.py. We\u2019ll only use a single file, but if you get lost, you can always refer to the source code.Representing a BlockchainWe\u2019ll create a Blockchain class whose constructor creates an initial empty list (to store our blockchain), and another to store transactions. Here\u2019s the blueprint for our class:Blueprint of our Blockchain ClassOur Blockchain class is responsible for managing the chain. It will store transactions and have some helper methods for adding new blocks to the chain. Let\u2019s start fleshing out some methods.What does a Block look like?Each Block has an index, a timestamp (in Unix time), a list of transactions, a proof (more on that later), and the hash of the previous Block.Here\u2019s an example of what a single Block looks like:Example of a Block in our BlockchainAt this point, the idea of a chain should be apparent\u2014each new block contains within itself, the hash of the previous Block. This is crucial because it\u2019s what gives blockchains immutability: If an attacker corrupted an earlier Block in the chain then all subsequent blocks will contain incorrect hashes.Does this make sense? If it doesn\u2019t, take some time to let it sink in\u2014it\u2019s the core idea behind blockchains.Adding Transactions to a BlockWe\u2019ll need a way of adding transactions to a Block. Our new_transaction() method is responsible for this, and it\u2019s pretty straight-forward:After new_transaction() adds a transaction to the list, it returns the index of the block which the transaction will be added to\u2014the next one to be mined. This will be useful later on, to the user submitting the transaction.Creating new BlocksWhen our Blockchain is instantiated we\u2019ll need to seed it with a genesis block\u2014a block with no predecessors. We\u2019ll also need to add a \u201cproof\u201d to our genesis block which is the result of mining (or proof of work). We\u2019ll talk more about mining later.In addition to creating the genesis block in our constructor, we\u2019ll also flesh out the methods for new_block(), new_transaction() and hash():The above should be straight-forward\u2014I\u2019ve added some comments and docstrings to help keep it clear. We\u2019re almost done with representing our blockchain. But at this point, you must be wondering how new blocks are created, forged or mined.Understanding Proof of WorkA Proof of Work algorithm (PoW) is how new Blocks are created or mined on the blockchain. The goal of PoW is to discover a number which solves a problem. The number must be difficult to find but easy to verify\u2014computationally speaking\u2014by anyone on the network. This is the core idea behind Proof of Work.We\u2019ll look at a very simple example to help this sink in.Let\u2019s decide that the hash of some integer x multiplied by another y must end in 0. So, hash(x * y) = ac23dc...0. And for this simplified example, let\u2019s fix x = 5. Implementing this in Python:from hashlib import sha256x = 5y = 0  # We don't know what y should be yet...while sha256(f'{x*y}'.encode()).hexdigest()[-1] != \"0\":    y += 1print(f'The solution is y = {y}')The solution here is y = 21. Since, the produced hash ends in 0:hash(5 * 21) = 1253e9373e...5e3600155e860In Bitcoin, the Proof of Work algorithm is called Hashcash. And it\u2019s not too different from our basic example above. It\u2019s the algorithm that miners race to solve in order to create a new block. In general, the difficulty is determined by the number of characters searched for in a string. The miners are then rewarded for their solution by receiving a coin\u2014in a transaction.The network is able to easily verify their solution.Implementing basic Proof of WorkLet\u2019s implement a similar algorithm for our blockchain. Our rule will be similar to the example above:Find a number p that when hashed with the previous block\u2019s solution a hash with 4 leading 0s is produced.To adjust the difficulty of the algorithm, we could modify the number of leading zeroes. But 4 is sufficient. You\u2019ll find out that the addition of a single leading zero makes a mammoth difference to the time required to find a solution.Our class is almost complete and we\u2019re ready to begin interacting with it using HTTP requests.Step 2: Our Blockchain as an APIWe\u2019re going to use the Python Flask Framework. It\u2019s a micro-framework and it makes it easy to map endpoints to Python functions. This allows us talk to our blockchain over the web using HTTP requests.We\u2019ll create three methods:/transactions/new to create a new transaction to a block/mine to tell our server to mine a new block./chain to return the full Blockchain.Setting up FlaskOur \u201cserver\u201d will form a single node in our blockchain network. Let\u2019s create some boilerplate code:A brief explanation of what we\u2019ve added above:Line 15: Instantiates our Node. Read more about Flask here.Line 18: Create a random name for our node.Line 21: Instantiate our Blockchain class.Line 24\u201326: Create the /mine endpoint, which is a GET request.Line 28\u201330: Create the /transactions/new endpoint, which is a POST request, since we\u2019ll be sending data to it.Line 32\u201338: Create the /chain endpoint, which returns the full Blockchain.Line 40\u201341: Runs the server on port 5000.The Transactions EndpointThis is what the request for a transaction will look like. It\u2019s what the user sends to the server:{ \"sender\": \"my address\", \"recipient\": \"someone else's address\", \"amount\": 5}Since we already have our class method for adding transactions to a block, the rest is easy. Let\u2019s write the function for adding transactions:A method for creating TransactionsThe Mining EndpointOur mining endpoint is where the magic happens, and it\u2019s easy. It has to do three things:Calculate the Proof of WorkReward the miner (us) by adding a transaction granting us 1 coinForge the new Block by adding it to the chainNote that the recipient of the mined block is the address of our node. And most of what we\u2019ve done here is just interact with the methods on our Blockchain class. At this point, we\u2019re done, and can start interacting with our blockchain.Step 3: Interacting with our BlockchainYou can use plain old cURL or Postman to interact with our API over a network.Fire up the server:$ python blockchain.py* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)Let\u2019s try mining a block by making a GET request to http://localhost:5000/mine:Using Postman to make a GET requestLet\u2019s create a new transaction by making a POST request tohttp://localhost:5000/transactions/new with a body containing our transaction structure:Using Postman to make a POST requestIf you aren\u2019t using Postman, then you can make the equivalent request using cURL:$ curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{ \"sender\": \"d4ee26eee15148ee92c6cd394edd974e\", \"recipient\": \"someone-other-address\", \"amount\": 5}' \"http://localhost:5000/transactions/new\"I restarted my server, and mined two blocks, to give 3 in total. Let\u2019s inspect the full chain by requesting http://localhost:5000/chain:{  \"chain\": [    {      \"index\": 1,      \"previous_hash\": 1,      \"proof\": 100,      \"timestamp\": 1506280650.770839,      \"transactions\": []    },    {      \"index\": 2,      \"previous_hash\": \"c099bc...bfb7\",      \"proof\": 35293,      \"timestamp\": 1506280664.717925,      \"transactions\": [        {          \"amount\": 1,          \"recipient\": \"8bbcb347e0634905b0cac7955bae152b\",          \"sender\": \"0\"        }      ]    },    {      \"index\": 3,      \"previous_hash\": \"eff91a...10f2\",      \"proof\": 35089,      \"timestamp\": 1506280666.1086972,      \"transactions\": [        {          \"amount\": 1,          \"recipient\": \"8bbcb347e0634905b0cac7955bae152b\",          \"sender\": \"0\"        }      ]    }  ],  \"length\": 3}Step 4: ConsensusThis is very cool. We\u2019ve got a basic Blockchain that accepts transactions and allows us to mine new Blocks. But the whole point of Blockchains is that they should be decentralized. And if they\u2019re decentralized, how on earth do we ensure that they all reflect the same chain? This is called the problem of Consensus, and we\u2019ll have to implement a Consensus Algorithm if we want more than one node in our network.Registering new NodesBefore we can implement a Consensus Algorithm, we need a way to let a node know about neighbouring nodes on the network. Each node on our network should keep a registry of other nodes on the network. Thus, we\u2019ll need some more endpoints:/nodes/register to accept a list of new nodes in the form of URLs./nodes/resolve to implement our Consensus Algorithm, which resolves any conflicts\u2014to ensure a node has the correct chain.We\u2019ll need to modify our Blockchain\u2019s constructor and provide a method for registering nodes:A method for adding neighbouring nodes to our NetworkNote that we\u2019ve used a set() to hold the list of nodes. This is a cheap way of ensuring that the addition of new nodes is idempotent\u2014meaning that no matter how many times we add a specific node, it appears exactly once.Implementing the Consensus AlgorithmAs mentioned, a conflict is when one node has a different chain to another node. To resolve this, we\u2019ll make the rule that the longest valid chain is authoritative. In other words, the longest chain on the network is the de-facto one. Using this algorithm, we reach Consensus amongst the nodes in our network.The first method valid_chain() is responsible for checking if a chain is valid by looping through each block and verifying both the hash and the proof.resolve_conflicts() is a method which loops through all our neighbouring nodes, downloads their chains and verifies them using the above method. If a valid chain is found, whose length is greater than ours, we replace ours.Let\u2019s register the two endpoints to our API, one for adding neighbouring nodes and the another for resolving conflicts:At this point you can grab a different machine if you like, and spin up different nodes on your network. Or spin up processes using different ports on the same machine. I spun up another node on my machine, on a different port, and registered it with my current node. Thus, I have two nodes: http://localhost:5000 and http://localhost:5001.Registering a new NodeI then mined some new Blocks on node 2, to ensure the chain was longer. Afterward, I called GET /nodes/resolve on node 1, where the chain was replaced by the Consensus Algorithm:Consensus Algorithm at WorkAnd that\u2019s a wrap... Go get some friends together to help test out your Blockchain.I hope that this has inspired you to create something new. I\u2019m ecstatic about Cryptocurrencies because I believe that Blockchains will rapidly change the way we think about economies, governments and record-keeping.Update: I\u2019m planning on following up with a Part 2, where we\u2019ll extend our Blockchain to have a Transaction Validation Mechanism as well as discuss some ways in which you can productionize your Blockchain.If you enjoyed this guide, or have any suggestions or questions, let me know in the comments.

Even the people who\u2019ve never mined a cryptocurrency or understand how it works, are talking about it. I have more non-technical friends than technical ones. They have been bugging me for weeks to explain this new buzzword to them. I guess there are thousands out there who feel the same. And when that happens, there comes a time to write something to which everyone can point the other lost souls to \u2014 that\u2019s the purpose of this post \u2014 written in plain english that any regular internet user understands.By the way, I am curator of a weekly newsletter, Unmade, which delivers one idea from the future to your inboxes.Blockchain: why do we even need something this complex?\u201cFor every complex problem there is an answer that is clear, simple, and wrong.\u201d \u2014 H. L. MenckenUnlike every other post on the internet, instead of first defining the Blockchain, we\u2019ll understand the problem it solves.Imagine, Joe is your best friend. He is traveling overseas, and on the fifth day of his vacation, he calls you and says, \u201cDude, I need some money. I have run out of it.\u201dYou reply, \u201cSending some right away,\u201d and hung up.You then call your account manager at your bank and tell him, \u201cPlease transfer $1000 from my account to Joe\u2019s account.\u201dYour account manager replies, \u201cYes, sir.\u201dHe opens up the register, checks your account balance to see if you have enough balance to transfer $1000 to Joe. Because you\u2019re a rich man, you have plenty; thus, he makes an entry in the register like the following:The Transaction RegisterNote: We\u2019re not talking about computers only to keep things simple.You call Joe and tell him, \u201cI\u2019ve transferred the money. Next time, you\u2019d go to your bank, you can withdraw the $1000 that I have just transferred.\u201dWhat just happened? You and Joe both trusted the bank to manage your money. There was no real movement of physical bills to transfer the money. All that was needed was an entry in the register. Or more precisely, an entry in the register that neither you nor Joe controls or owns.And that is the problem of the current systems.To establish trust between ourselves, we depend on individual third-parties.For years, we\u2019ve depended on these middlemen to trust each other. You might ask, \u201cwhat is the problem depending on them?\u201dThe problem is that they are singular in number. If a chaos has to be injected in the society, all it requires is one person/organization to go corrupt, intentionally or unintentionally.What if that register in which the transaction was logged gets burnt in a fire?What if, by mistake, your account manager had written $1500 instead of $1000?What if he did that on purpose?For years, we have been putting all our eggs in one basket and that too in someone else\u2019s.Could there be a system where we can still transfer money without needing the bank?To answer this question, we\u2019ll need to drill down further and ask ourselves a better question (after all, only better questions lead to better answers).Think about it for a second, what does transferring money means? Just an entry in the register. The better question would then be \u2014Is there a way to maintain the register among ourselves instead of someone else doing it for us?Now, that is a question worth exploring. And the answer is what you might have already guessed. The blockchain is the answer to the profound question.It is a method to maintain that register among ourselves instead of depending on someone else to do it for us.Are you still with me? Good. Because now, when several questions have started popping in your mind, we will learn how this distributed register works.Yes, but tell me, how does it work?The requirement of this method is that there must be enough people who would like not to depend on a third-party. Only then this group can maintain the register on their own.\u201cIt might make sense just to get some Bitcoin in case it catches on. If enough people think the same way, that becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.\u201d \u2014 Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009How many are enough? At least three. For our example, we will assume ten individuals want to give up on banks or any third-party. Upon mutual agreement, they have details of each other\u2019s accounts all the time \u2014 without knowing the other\u2019s identity.1. An Empty FolderEveryone contains an empty folder with themselves to start with. As we\u2019ll progress, all these ten individuals will keep adding pages to their currently empty folders. And this collection of pages will form the register that tracks the transactions.2. When A Transaction HappensNext, everyone in the network sits with a blank page and a pen in their hands. Everyone is ready to write any transaction that occurs within the system.Now, if #2 wants to send $10 to #9.To make the transaction, #2 shouts and tells everyone, \u201cI want to transfer $10 to #9. So, everyone, please make a note of it on your pages.\u201dEveryone checks whether #2 has enough balance to transfer $10 to #9. If she has enough balance, everyone then makes a note of the transaction on their blank pages.First transaction on the pageThe transaction is then considered to be complete.3. Transactions Continue HappeningAs the time passes, more people in the network feel the need to transfer money to others. Whenever they want to make a transaction, they announce it to everyone else. As soon as a person listens to the announcement, (s)he writes it on his/her page.This exercise continues until everyone runs out of space on the current page. Assuming a page has space to record ten transactions, as soon as the tenth transaction is made, everybody runs out of the space.When page gets filledIt\u2019s time to put the page away in the folder and bring out a new page and repeat the process from the step 2 above.4. Putting Away The PageBefore we put away the page in our folders, we need to seal it with a unique key that everyone in the network agrees upon. By sealing it, we will make sure that no one can make any changes to it once its copies have been put away in everyone\u2019s folder \u2014 not today, not tomorrow and not even after a year. Once in the folder, it will always stay in the folder \u2014 sealed. Moreover, if everyone trusts the seal, everyone trusts the contents of the page. And this sealing of the page is the crux of this method.[Jargon Box] It is called \u2018mining\u2019 on the page to secure it, but for the simplicity of it, we\u2019ll keep calling it \u2018sealing.\u2019Earlier the third-party/middleman gave us the trust that whatever they have written in the register will never be altered. In a distributed and decentralized system like ours, this seal will provide the trust instead.Interesting! How do we seal the page then?Before we learn how we can seal the page, we\u2019ll know how the seal works, in general. And as a pre-requisite to it is learning about something that I like to call\u2026The Magic MachineImagine a machine surrounded by thick walls. If you send a box with something inside it from the left, it will spit out a box containing something else.[Jargon Box] This machine is called \u2018Hash Function,\u2019 but we aren\u2019t in a mood to be too technical. So, for today, these are \u2018The Magic Machines.\u2019The Magic Machine (aka Hashing Function)Suppose, you send the number 4 inside it from the left, we\u2019d find that it spat out the following word on its right: \u2018dcbea.\u2019How did it convert the number 4 to this word? No one knows. Moreover, it is an irreversible process. Given the word, \u2018dcbea,\u2019 it is impossible to tell what the machine was fed on the left. But every time you\u2019d feed the number 4 to the machine, it will always spit out the same word, \u2018dcbea.\u2019hash(4) == dcbeaGiven the word, \u2018dcbea,\u2019 it is impossible to tell what the machine was fed on the left. But every time you\u2019d feed the number 4 to the machine, it will always spit out the same word, \u2018dcbea.\u2019Let\u2019s try sending in a different number. How about 26?hash(26) == 94c8eWe got \u201894c8e\u2019 this time. Interesting! So, the words can contain the numbers too.What if I ask you the following question now:\u201cCan you tell me what should I send from the left side of the machine such that I get a word that starts with three leading zeroes from the right side of it? For example, 000ab or 00098 or 000fa or anything among the others.\u201dPredicting the inputThink about the question for a moment.I\u2019ve told you the machine has a property that we cannot calculate what we must send from the left after we\u2019re given the expected output on the right. With such a machine given to us, how can we answer the question I asked?I can think of one method. Why not try every number in the universe one by one until we get a word that starts with three leading zeroes?Try everything to calculate the inputBeing optimistic, after several thousand attempts, we\u2019ll end up with a number that will yield the required output on the right.It was extremely difficult to calculate the input given the output. But at the same time, it will always be incredibly easy to verify if the predicted input yields the required output. Remember that the machine spits out the same word for a number every time.How difficult do you think the answer is if I give you a number, say 72533, and ask you the question, \u201cDoes this number, when fed into the machine, yields a word that starts with three leading zeroes?\u201dAll you need to do is, throw the number in the machine and see what did you get on the right side of it. That\u2019s it.The most important property of such machines is that \u2014 \u201cGiven an output, it is extremely difficult to calculate the input, but given the input and the output, it is pretty easy to verify if the input leads to the output.\u201dWe\u2019ll remember this one property of the Magic Machines (or Hash Functions) through the rest of the post:Given an output, it is extremely difficult to calculate the input, but given an input and output, it is pretty easy to verify if the input leads to the output.How to use these machines to seal a page?We\u2019ll use this magic machine to generate a seal for our page. Like always, we\u2019ll start with an imaginary situation.Imagine I give you two boxes. The first box contains the number 20893. I, then, ask you, \u201cCan you figure out a number that when added to the number in the first box and fed to the machine will give us a word that starts with three leading zeroes?\u201dThis is a similar situation as we saw previously and we have learned that the only way to calculate such a number is by trying every number available in the entire universe.After several thousand attempts, we\u2019ll stumble upon a number, say 21191, which when added to 20893 (i.e. 21191 + 20893 = 42084) and fed to the machine, will yield a word that satisfies our requirements.In such a case, this number, 21191 becomes the seal for the number 20893. Assume there is a page that bears the number 20893 written on it. To seal that page (i.e. no one can change the contents of it), we will put a badge labeled \u201821191\u2019 on top of it. As soon as the sealing number (i.e. 21191) is stuck on the page, the page is sealed.The sealed number[Jargon Box] The sealing number is called \u2018Proof Of Work,\u2019 meaning that this number is the proof that efforts had been made to calculate it. We are good with calling it \u2018sealing number\u2019 for our purposes.If anyone wants to verify whether the page was altered, all he would have to do is \u2014 add the contents of the page with the sealing number and feed to the magic machine. If the machine gives out a word with three leading zeroes, the contents were untouched. If the word that comes out doesn\u2019t meet our requirements, we can throw away the page because its contents were compromised, and are of no use.We\u2019ll use a similar sealing mechanism to seal all our pages and eventually arrange them in our respective folders.Finally, sealing our page\u2026To seal our page that contains the transactions of the network, we\u2019ll need to figure out a number that when appended to the list of transactions and fed to the machine, we get a word that starts with three leading zeroes on the right.Note: I have been using the phrase \u2018word starting with three leading zeroes\u2019 only as an example. It illustrates how Hashing Functions work. The real challenges are much more complicated than this.Once that number is calculated after spending time and electricity on the machine, the page is sealed with that number. If ever, someone tries to change the contents of the page, the sealing number will allow anyone to verify the integrity of the page.Now that we know about sealing the page, we will go back to the time when we had finished writing the tenth transaction on the page, and we ran out of space to write more.As soon as everyone runs out of the page to write further transactions, they indulge in calculating the sealing number for the page so that it can be tucked away in the folder. Everyone in the network does the calculation. The first one in the network to figure out the sealing number announces it to everyone else.Immediately on hearing the sealing number, everyone verifies if it yields the required output or not. If it does, everyone labels their pages with this number and put it away in their folders.But what if for someone, say #7, the sealing number that was announced doesn\u2019t yield the required output? Such cases are not unusual. The possible reasons for this could be:He might have misheard the transactions that were announced in the networkHe might have miswritten the transactions that were announced in the networkHe might have tried to cheat or be dishonest when writing transactions, either to favor himself or someone else in the networkNo matter what the reason is, #7 has only one choice \u2014 to discard his page and copy it from someone else so that he too can put it in the folder. Unless he doesn\u2019t put his page in the folder, he cannot continue writing further transactions, thus, forbidding him to be part of the network.Whatever sealing number the majority agrees upon, becomes the honest sealing number.Then why does everyone spend resources doing the calculation when they know that someone else will calculate and announce it to them? Why not sit idle and wait for the announcement?Great question. This is where the incentives come in the picture. Everyone who is the part of the Blockchain is eligible for rewards. The first one to calculate the sealing number gets rewarded with free money for his efforts (i.e. expended CPU power and electricity).Simply imagine, if #5 calculates the sealing number of a page, he gets rewarded with some free money, say $1, that gets minted out of thin air. In other words, the account balance of #5 gets incremented with $1 without decreasing anyone else\u2019s account balance.That\u2019s how Bitcoin got into existence. It was the first currency to be transacted on a Blockchain (i.e. distributed registers). And in return, to keep the efforts going on in the network, people were awarded Bitcoins.When enough people possess Bitcoins, they grow in value, making other people wanting Bitcoins; making Bitcoins grow in value even further; making even more people wanting Bitcoins; making them grow in value even further; and so on.The rewards make everyone keep working in the network.And once everyone tucks away the page in their folders, they bring out a new blank page and repeat the whole process all over again \u2014 doing it forever.[Jargon Box] Think of a single page as a Block of transactions and the folder as the Chain of pages (Blocks), therefore, turning it into a Blockchain.And that, my friends, is how Blockchain works.Except that there\u2019s one tiny thing I didn\u2019t tell you. Yet.Imagine there are five pages in the folder already \u2014 all sealed with a sealing number. What if I go back to the second page and modify a transaction to favor myself? The sealing number will let anyone detect the inconsistency in the transactions, right? What if I go ahead and calculate a new sealing number too for the modified transactions and label the page with that instead?To prevent this problem of someone going back and modifying a page (Block) as well as the sealing number, there\u2019s a little twist to how a sealing number is calculated.Protecting modifications to the sealing numbersRemember how I told you that I had given you two boxes \u2014 one containing the number 20893 and another empty for you to calculate? In reality, to calculate the sealing number in a Blockchain, instead of two boxes, there are three \u2014 two pre-filled and one to be calculated.And when the contents of all those three boxes are added and fed to the machine, the answer that comes out from the right side must satisfy the required conditions.We already know that one box contains the list of transactions and one box will contain the sealing number. The third box contains the output of the magic machine for the previous page.With this neat little trick, we have made sure that every page depends on its previous page. Therefore, if someone has to modify a historical page, he would also have to change the contents and the sealing number of all the pages after that, to keep the chain consistent.If one individual, out of the ten we imagined in the beginning, tries to cheat and modify the contents of the Blockchain (the folder containing the pages with the list of transactions), he would have to adjust several pages and also calculate the new sealing numbers for all those pages. We know how difficult it is to calculate the sealing numbers. Therefore, one dishonest guy in the network cannot beat the nine honest guys.What will happen is, from the page the dishonest guy tries to cheat, he would be creating another chain in the network, but that chain would never be able to catch up with the honest chain \u2014 simply because one guy\u2019s efforts and speed cannot beat cumulative efforts and speed of nine. Hence, guaranteeing that the longest chain in a network is the honest chain.Longest chain is the honest chain.Longest chain is the honest chain.When I told you that one dishonest guy cannot beat nine honest guys, did it ring any bell in your head?What if, instead of one, six guys turn dishonest?In that case, the protocol will fall flat on its face. And it is known as \u201c51% Attack\u201d. If the majority of the individuals in the network decides to turn dishonest and cheat the rest of the network, the protocol will fail its purpose.And that\u2019s the only vulnerable reason why Blockchains might collapse if they ever will. Know that, it is unlikely to happen but we must all know the vulnerable points of the system. It is built on the assumption that the majority of a crowd is always honest.And that, my friends, is all there is about Blockchains. If you ever find someone feeling left behind and wondering, \u201cWTF is the Blockchain?\u201d you know where you can point them to.

And yet, after years of tireless effort and billions of dollars invested, nobody has actually come up with a use for the blockchain\u2014besides currency speculation and illegal transactions.Each purported use case \u2014 from payments to legal documents, from escrow to voting systems\u2014amounts to a set of contortions to add a distributed, encrypted, anonymous ledger where none was needed. What if there isn\u2019t actually any use for a distributed ledger at all? What if, ten years after it was invented, the reason nobody has adopted a distributed ledger at scale is because nobody wants it?Payments and bankingThe original intended use of the blockchain was to power currencies like bitcoin \u2014 a way to store and exchange value much like any other currency. Visa and MasterCard were dinosaurs, everyone proclaimed, because there was now a costless, instant way to exchange value without the middleman taking a cut. A revolution in banking was just the start\u2026 governments, unable to issue currency by fiat anymore, would take a back seat as individual citizens transacted freely outside any national system.The killer feature: knowing you can get your money backIt didn\u2019t take long for that dream to fall apart. For one thing, there\u2019s already a costless, instant way to exchange value without a middleman: cash. Bitcoins substitute for dollars, but Visa and MasterCard actually sit on top of dollar-based banking transactions, providing a set of value-added services like enabling banks to track fraud disputes, and verifying the identity of the buyer and seller. It turns out that for the person paying for a product, the key feature of a new payment system \u2014 think of PayPal in its early days \u2014 is the confidence that if the goods aren\u2019t as described you\u2019ll get your money back. And for the person accepting payment, basically the key feature is that their customer has it, and is willing to use it. Add in points, credit lines, and a free checked bag on any United flight and you have something that consumers choose and merchants accept. Nobody actually wants to pay with bitcoin, which is why it hasn\u2019t taken off.The key feature of a new payment system \u2014 think of PayPal in its early days \u2014 is the confidence that if the goods aren\u2019t as described you\u2019ll get your money back.It would take 5,000 nuclear reactors to run Visa on the blockchain.Plus, it\u2019s not actually that good a payment system \u2014 Visa can handle sixty thousand transactions per second, while Bitcoin historically taps out at seven. There are technical modifications going on to improve Bitcoin\u2019s efficiency, but as a starting point, you have something that\u2019s about 0.01% as good at clearing transactions. (And, worth noting, for those seven transactions a second Bitcoin is already estimated to use 35 times as much energy as Visa. If you brought Bitcoin\u2019s transaction volume up to Visa\u2019s it would be using as much electricity as the rest of the world put together.)Freedom to transact without government supervisionIn many countries, and often our own, a little bit of ability to keep a few things private from the authorities probably makes the world a better place. In places like Cuba or Venezuela, many prefer to transact in dollars, and bitcoin could in theory serve a similar function. Yet there are two reasons this hasn\u2019t been the panacea it\u2019s assumed: the advantages of government to the individual, and the advantages of government to society.Mt Gox loses all its customers\u2019 moneyThe government-backed banking system provides FDIC guarantees, reversibility of ACH, identity verification, audit standards, and an investigation system when things go wrong. Bitcoin, by design, has none of these things. I saw a remarkable message thread by someone whose bitcoin account got drained because their email had been hacked and their password was stolen. They were stunned to have no recourse! And this is widespread \u2014 in 2014, the then-#1 bitcoin trader, Mt. Gox, also lost $400m of investor money due to security failures. The subsequent #1 bitcoin trader, Bitfinex, also shut down after a loss of customer funds. Imagine the world if more banks had been drained of customer funds than not. Bitcoin is what banking looked like in the middle ages \u2014 \u201chere\u2019s your libertarian paradise, have a nice day.\u201dBitFinex loses all of its customers\u2019 moneyBitcoin is what banking looked like in the middle ages \u2014 \u201chere\u2019s your libertarian paradise, have a nice day.[This issue is particularly near and dear to my heart because my own company, True Link, is designed to help vulnerable seniors \u2014 people likely to give out their credit card number over the phone, enter sketchy sweepstakes or donate to sketchy charities, participate in scam investments, or install password-stealing malware. As the people who most need security enhancements in banking and payments, they depend heavily on the existing protections and would absolutely be harmed by many of the proposed changes in favor of private-key authenticated, instant, and irreversible transfers. Someone starting from a human perspective on banking security\u2014who is currently harmed and how can we help them?\u2014would come up with something very different from blockchain!]Mongolian banks experienced +400% transaction volume with new sanctions against Russia. New slogan \u2013\u201cBitcoin: less cops than Mongolia.\u201dSecond, government policies are designed to disrupt terrorist financing and organized crime, and prevent traffic in illegal goods like stolen credit card numbers or child pornography. The mainstream preference is to have transactions private but not undiscoverable under warrant \u2014 ask \u201cshould the government have a list everyone you\u2019ve paid money to,\u201d and most will say no; ask \u201cshould the government be able under warrant to get a list everyone a child pornography collector has paid money to,\u201d and most will say yes. Nobody wants bitcoin to 100x the total traffic in goods and services our government defines as illegal \u2014 as one bitcoin enthusiast pointed out to me, \u201cIf you invented cash today, it would be illegal too.\u201dMicropayments and bank-to-bank transfersIt\u2019s worth noting two particular payment use cases where people are particularly excited about blockchain-based currencies: micropayments and bank-to-bank transfers. In terms of micropayments, people enthuse that bitcoin transactions are free and instant. Actually, they take about eight minutes to clear and cost about four cents to process. People have proposed that you will use bitcoins for micropayments \u2014 for example, paying two cents to a musician to listen to their song on the internet, or four cents to read a newspaper article. Yet the infrastructure to do this \u2014 for example, advance authorization with the source of funds so you don\u2019t have to wait eight minutes to read the article you just clicked \u2014 actually eliminates the need for bitcoin at all. If you\u2019re happy to pay four cents an article or two cents a song, you can set it up to bill once a month from your bank account and read to your heart\u2019s content. And in practice, people prefer subscription services to micropayments.Three years in, Ripple is to SWIFT what toothpicks are to the US GDPIn terms of interbank payments, many people mention Ripple as a promising way to transfer money between banks. Over the last 30 days it processed two billion dollars (as of this writing) worth of interbank and interpersonal transactions \u2014 about 40 seconds\u2019 worth of volume on the SWIFT interbank network \u2014 after three years of being available to banks to trade 90% of the world\u2019s high-volume currencies. This is like the proportion of US GDP comprised by toothpick sales. Why haven\u2019t banks preferred this new technology? The answer is that setting up a Ripple Gateway isn\u2019t actually much different than using the existing corresponding-account system \u2014 except that a lost password or security token can lead to much larger and more instant actual losses \u2014 which, as a reminder, has happened to more leading bitcoin exchanges than have managed to avoid it. The same features that make the banking system attractive to end users also make it attractive to banks. They already have ledgers, and don\u2019t need to distribute them, anonymize them, encrypt them, publish them, and make them irreversible.\u201cSmart\u201d contracts\u201cSmart\u201d contracts are contracts written as software, rather than written as legal text. Because you can encode them directly on the blockchain, they can involve the transfer of value based directly on the cryptographic consent of the parties involved \u2014 in other words, they are \u201cself-executing.\u201d And in theory, contracts written in software are cheaper to interpret \u2014 because their operation is literally mathematical and automatic, there are no two ways to interpret them, which means there\u2019s no need for expensive legal battles.The DAO loses all its customers\u2019 moneyAnd yet the real-world examples show the ways this is problematic. The most prominent and largest smart contract to date, an investment vehicle called the Distributed Autonomous Organization (DAO), enabled its members to invest directly using their private cryptographic keys to vote on what to invest in. No lawyers, no management fees, no opaque boardrooms, the DAO \u201cremoves the ability of directors and fund managers to misdirect and waste investor funds.\u201d And yet, due to a software bug, the DAO \u201cvoted\u201d to \u201cinvest\u201d $50m, a third of its members\u2019 money, into a vehicle controlled by very clever programmers who knew a lot about recursion issues during balance updates. Some said this was a hack or an exploit because the software had not functioned as intended, while others said that there was no such thing as a hack \u2014 the whole point was that the software made decisions autonomously and there were no two ways to interpret it, and if you didn\u2019t understand how the software worked you shouldn\u2019t have participated. In the end, everyone got together and voted to retroactively amend the software contract and move the money back to its original owners. What\u2019s the takeaway? Even the most die-hard blockchain enthusiasts actually want a bunch of humans arguing about the underlying intention behind a contract, rather than letting the software self-execute. Maybe the \u201cdumb\u201d way is smart after all?Even crypto enthusiasts want to argue about what their contracts meanThe DAO was an illustrative experiment, but what about for routine transactions at big companies? The investors and startups in the smart-contract space promise that the block chain will enable super-fast execution and payment \u2014 for example that in healthcare applications, \u201cinstead of waiting 90\u2013180 days for a claim to be processed, or spending hours on the phone trying to get your bill paid, it can in theory be processed on the spot.\u201d But that\u2019s true for any software-enabled purchasing system. My company\u2019s Amazon servers scale automatically based on website traffic and bill us for how much we use. The idea that smart contracts would change this is a fallacy \u2014 it conflates the legal arrangement being put into effect with software with the legal arrangement itself being coded as software. Amazon\u2019s terms of service are not a smart contract, but the billing system that implements those terms is automated. To the extent that health insurance billing, for example, is not automated, the problem isn\u2019t that existing software isn\u2019t \u201csmart\u201d enough to handle submitting claims and paying them electronically, it\u2019s that the insurance company is slow moving, either by accident or because they on-purpose prefer a human review.Can bitcoin make this go faster please?In the end, everyone from blockchain enthusiasts to health insurers actually wants to argue out in human language what the business relationship is and interpret it on an ongoing basis, and then to write software that handles the fulfillment and payment. That already exists \u2014 it\u2019s the status quo.Distributed storage, computing, and messagingAnother implausible idea is using the blockchain as a distributed storage mechanism. On its face it makes sense \u2014 you break your document up into \u201cblocks\u201d, encrypt them, and put them in a distributed ledger\u2026 it\u2019s backed up across multiple locations, it\u2019s secure, and easy to track everything that happened.Yet there are multiple excellent ways to break up files, encrypt them, and replicate them across multiple storage media in different locations. There is already a company that bills itself as a cheaper, distributed Dropbox, which encrypts and stores files across multiple users\u2019 hard drives and pays them a small fee for the free space on their hard drives. The block chain is just a particularly inefficient and insecure way of doing this.Ha! Can your blockchain do THIS?There are four additional problems with a blockchain-driven approach. First, you\u2019re relying on single-point encryption \u2014 your own private keys \u2014 rather than a more sophisticated system that might involve two-factor authorization, intrusion detection, volume limits, firewalls, remote IP tracking, and the ability to disconnect the system in an emergency. Second, price tradeoffs are entirely implausible \u2014 the bitcoin blockchain has consumed almost a billion dollars worth of electricity to hash an amount of data equivalent to about a sixth of what I get for my ten dollar a month dropbox subscription. Fourth, systematically choosing where and how much to replicate data is an advantage in the long run \u2014 the blockchain\u2019s defaults on data replication just aren\u2019t that smart. And finally, Dropbox and Box.com and Google and Microsoft and Apple and Amazon and everyone else provide a set of valuable other features that you don\u2019t actually want to go develop on your own. Analogous to Visa, the problem isn\u2019t storing data, it\u2019s managing permissions, un-sharing what you shared before, getting an easy-to-view document history, syncing it on multiple devices, and so on.The same argument holds for proposed distributed computing and secure messaging applications. Encrypting it, storing it forever, and replicating it across the entire network is just a ton of overhead relative to what you\u2019re actually trying to accomplish. There are excellent computing, messaging, and storage solutions out there that have all the encryption and replication anyone needs \u2014 actually better than blockchain based solutions \u2014 and have plenty of other great features in addition.Stock issuanceIt was much-heralded when NASDAQ launched an internal blockchain-driven exchange for privately-held stocks. But wait: correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but the whole purpose of NASDAQ (or the DTCC trade clearing system, for example) is that it has a ledger of who owns what stocks? Were they nervous that their systems, absent blockchain, would soon be unable to keep track of who owns what?Similar to other transaction-tracking problems such as customer-to-merchant payments, the difference between NASDAQ\u2019s ledger and blockchain\u2019s ledger is that blockchain is distributed \u2014 it addresses the problem of lack of a trusted intermediary. And yet (for legal transactions) the company itself, its transfer agent of record, a clearinghouse, or an exchange are all trusted intermediaries and typically provide value-added services in addition. The reason NASDAQ is the right home for a blockchain-driven exchange is that they\u2019re expert in the compliance and security aspects of trading stock. Cut out the middleman (here, NASDAQ itself) and the government and you\u2019ll ultimately be limited to companies that choose to make an end-run around the legal, compliance, and tracking systems common to the mainstream market. As people who trade in unlisted stocks will tell you, that\u2019s a recipe for getting your money stolen.Why you want to file securities paperwork when you issue securitiesAnd we\u2019re already seeing this. New companies have also begun creating blockchain-based \u201ccoins\u201d convertible into company stock, and selling them to the public in Initial Coin Offerings, or ICOs, as a cheaper and more flexible way to raise money than a traditional Initial Public Offering of stocks on an exchange. It will be interesting to see how long this craze lasts \u2014 among other things, offering tokens convertible to stock counts as a securities offering, and so the SEC rules presumably apply to these securities offerings just like any other. Either the \u201ccoins\u201d are just less-secure electronic stock certificates \u2014 protected by however carefully you store your password, rather than by the laws and protections of a securities exchange \u2014 or it\u2019s another attempt to do an end-run around the law.Authenticity verificationAnother plausible use of the blockchain is that if you want to make a public, unalterable, undeleteable signed statement, you can \u201cpublish\u201d it to the block chain \u2014 thinking of the distributed ledger as more like a diary than a way to buy and sell. In theory you could use this for recording vote tallies, verifying the origin of diamonds or brand-name gear, verifying people\u2019s identity, resolving the ownership of domain names, keeping items in escrow, disclosing provisional patents under seal, notarizing documents, and so on.One vote per person. Bitcoin wallets are harder to count!Without diving too thoroughly into the details of each of these, it seems the use cases all fall apart pretty quickly. For voting, the status quo is recording the total number of ballots cast, with the voter dropping a visible paper ballot in a box, and journalists and observers from both sides watching the ballot boxes the whole time. The tough problem in voting is keeping who voted for who anonymous and yet making sure that voters and votes are one to one. Paper does this so much better than blockchain.For a public notary or similar, verifying your driver\u2019s license or having witnesses known to you present means that it wasn\u2019t signed with a stolen password or private key \u2014 but, if a password or private key is adequate, you can just publish it signed with a PGP key. For establishing the authenticity of brand name goods like watches or handbags, or that a diamond was ethically mined, the ledger being distributed and encrypted doesn\u2019t add any value \u2014 the originating company can just include a certificate you can verify online, just as they have done in the past. In cases of escrow, a smart contract can automatically pay for the goods without a need for a third party to verify and hold the funds, but you still need a trusted party to verify that the goods are delivered and as-promised.Proving you know something, in the modern worldAnd finally, if you want to irrefutably prove that you knew X at time Y without disclosing the actual knowledge publicly, encrypt it and email it to yourself at both a gmail and a hotmail address or post it on bitbucket, or print it out and notarize it, or postmark it by mailing it to yourself, or tweet an md5 of it, or whatever. But then again, how large is the irrefutably-prove-you-knew-X-at-time-Y-without-disclosing-X industry? Can you think of any leading company, or any company at all, that provides this service?For domain resolution \u2014 the process of figuring out whose servers get to see the traffic and respond to your requests when you type a URL into your address bar \u2014 it\u2019s promising to imagine that an all-digital record of smart contracts, where the actual act of payment being published to the ledger also updates who the domain resolves to, obviating the need for domain escrow services. Yet in practice, as with the DAO or other smart contracts, if valuable domains change hands due to theft or security issues, you actually need a way to override the ledger \u2014 as the result of a court order, for example. Just like with government-backed, law-backed bank accounts, real companies won\u2019t prefer a situation in which a security breach or stolen password could result in someone else permanently and irrevocably owning bankofamerica.com or disney.com or sony.com or whatever. Adopting block chain technology makes theft or impersonation more likely rather than less. It sounds hypothetical until you realize more leading bitcoin exchanges have been hacked than not \u2014 something that very rarely happens with the leading domain name providers.So what\u2019s left?Washing machines of the future will be able to order their own detergentEach of these seems trivial \u2014 yes, everyone knows handbags already come with certificates of authenticity with an ID number you can look up online \u2014 except that in each case, millions if not tens of millions of dollars have been spent on entire companies dedicated to just that particular use case. And you can get even more esoteric \u2014 Second Life on the blockchain, or blockchain-enabled appliances so your washing machine can smart-contract for its own detergent, or a sports league where the coaching decisions are written on the blockchain. (For real!)In the end, the advantages of the existing human and software systems surrounding transactions \u2014 from verifying identity with a driver\u2019s license to calling and clarifying the statements made in a credit disputed transaction to automatically billing your credit card for a newspaper subscription \u2014 outweigh the purported benefits, as well as hidden costs, of irrevocable, automated execution. Blockchain enthusiasts often act as if the hard part is getting money from A to B or keeping a record of what happened. In each case, moving money and recording the transaction is actually the cheap, easy, highly-automated part of a much more complex system.Nobody went out and did a survey about whether most credit card users would be willing to give up their frequent flyer miles in return for also losing the ability to dispute a transaction.Which leaves us where we started \u2014 currency speculation and illegal transactions \u2014 along with perhaps a lesson. In conversations with bitcoin entrepreneurs and investors and consultants, there was often a lack of knowledge or even interest in how the jobs were being done today or what the value to the end user was. With all the money spent on bitcoin cash registers, nobody went out and did a survey about whether most credit card users would be willing to give up their frequent flyer miles in return for also losing the ability to dispute a transaction. Presumably, they thought, the reason IPOs are so expensive or venture fund formation paperwork is so onerous is because all those lawyers and accountants are just getting rich sitting around pushing paper\u2026 a bunch of smart engineers in their 20s with no industry experience could certainly do their jobs, automatically, in a matter of months, with just a few million bucks of venture capital.So far, not so much.Don\u2019t smart contract me, bro!Kai Stinchcombe is CEO and cofounder of True Link Financial, a banking and investment service for seniors.

Its failure to achieve adoption to date is because systems built on trust, norms, and institutions inherently function better than the type of no-need-for-trusted-parties systems blockchain envisions. That\u2019s permanent: no matter how much blockchain improves it is still headed in the wrong direction.This December I wrote a widely-circulated article on the inapplicability of blockchain to any actual problem. People objected mostly not to the technology argument, but rather hoped that decentralization could produce integrity.Let\u2019s start with this: Venmo is a free service to transfer dollars, and bitcoin transfers are not free. Yet after I wrote an article last December saying bitcoin had no use, someone responded that Venmo and Paypal are raking in consumers\u2019 money and people should switch to bitcoin.What a surreal contrast between blockchain\u2019s non-usefulness/non-adoption and the conviction of its believers! It\u2019s so entirely evident that this person didn\u2019t become a bitcoin enthusiast because they were looking for a convenient, free way to transfer money from one person to another and discovered bitcoin. In fact, I would assert that there is no single person in existence who had a problem they wanted to solve, discovered that an available blockchain solution was the best way to solve it, and therefore became a blockchain enthusiast.There is no single person in existence who had a problem they wanted to solve, discovered that an available blockchain solution was the best way to solve it, and therefore became a blockchain enthusiast.The number of retailers accepting cryptocurrency as a form of payment is declining, and its biggest corporate boosters like IBM, NASDAQ, Fidelity, Swift and Walmart have gone long on press but short on actual rollout. Even the most prominent blockchain company, Ripple, doesn\u2019t use blockchain in its product. You read that right: the company Ripple decided the best way to move money across international borders was to not use Ripples.A blockchain is a literal technology, not a metaphorWhy all the enthusiasm for something so useless in practice?People have made a number of implausible claims about the future of blockchain\u2014like that you should use it for AI in place of the type of behavior-tracking that google and facebook do, for example. This is based on a misunderstanding of what a blockchain is. A blockchain isn\u2019t an ethereal thing out there in the universe that you can \u201cput\u201d things into, it\u2019s a specific data structure: a linear transaction log, typically replicated by computers whose owners (called miners) are rewarded for logging new transactions.In The Golden Compass, Dust permeates the world. It is created by consciousness and is itself conscious, and can condense into angels. Blockchain is not like that.There are two things that are cool about this particular data structure. One is that a change in any block invalidates every block after it, which means that you can\u2019t tamper with historical transactions. The second is that you only get rewarded if you\u2019re working on the same chain as everyone else, so each participant has an incentive to go with the consensus.The end result is a shared definitive historical record. And, what\u2019s more, because consensus is formed by each person acting in their own interest, adding a false transaction or working from a different history just means you\u2019re not getting paid and everyone else is. Following the rules is mathematically enforced\u2014no government or police force need come in and tell you the transaction you\u2019ve logged is false (or extort bribes or bully the participants). It\u2019s a powerful idea.So in summary, here\u2019s what blockchain-the-technology is: \u201cLet\u2019s create a very long sequence of small files \u2014 each one containing a hash of the previous file, some new data, and the answer to a difficult math problem \u2014 and divide up some money every hour among anyone willing to certify and store those files for us on their computers.\u201dNow, here\u2019s what blockchain-the-metaphor is: \u201cWhat if everyone keeps their records in a tamper-proof repository not owned by anyone?\u201dAn illustration of the difference: In 2006, Walmart launched a system to track its bananas and mangoes from field to store. In 2009 they abandoned it because of logistical problems getting everyone to enter the data, and in 2017 they re-launched it (to much fanfare) on blockchain. If someone comes to you with \u201cthe mango-pickers don\u2019t like doing data entry,\u201d \u201cI know: let\u2019s create a very long sequence of small files, each one containing a hash of the previous file\u201d is a nonsense answer, but \u201cWhat if everyone keeps their records in a tamper-proof repository not owned by anyone?\u201d at least addresses the right question!Blockchain-based trustworthiness falls apart in practicePeople treat blockchain as a \u201cfuturistic integrity wand\u201d\u2014wave a blockchain at the problem, and suddenly your data will be valid. For almost anything people want to be valid, blockchain has been proposed as a solution.It\u2019s true that tampering with data stored on a blockchain is hard, but it\u2019s false that blockchain is a good way to create data that has integrity.It\u2019s true that tampering with data stored on a blockchain is hard, but it\u2019s false that blockchain is a good way to create data that has integrity.To understand why this is the case, let\u2019s work from the practical to the theoretical. For example, let\u2019s consider a widely-proposed use case for blockchain: buying an e-book with a \u201csmart\u201d contract. The goal of the blockchain is, you don\u2019t trust an e-book vendor and they don\u2019t trust you (because you\u2019re just two individuals on the internet), but, because it\u2019s on blockchain, you\u2019ll be able to trust the transaction.In the traditional system, once you pay you\u2019re hoping you\u2019ll receive the book, but once the vendor has your money they don\u2019t have any incentive to deliver. You\u2019re relying on Visa or Amazon or the government to make things fair\u2014what a recipe for being a chump! In contrast, on a blockchain system, by executing the transaction as a record in a tamper-proof repository not owned by anyone, the transfer of money and digital product is automatic, atomic, and direct, with no middleman needed to arbitrate the transaction, dictate terms, and take a fat cut on the way. Isn\u2019t that better for everybody?Hm. Perhaps you are very skilled at writing software. When the novelist proposes the smart contract, you take an hour or two to make sure that the contract will withdraw only an amount of money equal to the agreed-upon price, and that the book \u2014 rather than some other file, or nothing at all \u2014 will actually arrive.An e-book consultantAuditing software is hard! The most-heavily scrutinized smart contract in history had a small bug that nobody noticed \u2014 that is, until someone did notice it, and used it to steal fifty million dollars. If cryptocurrency enthusiasts putting together a $150m investment fund can\u2019t properly audit the software, how confident are you in your e-book audit? Perhaps you would rather write your own counteroffer software contract, in case this e-book author has hidden a recursion bug in their version to drain your ethereum wallet of all your life savings?It\u2019s a complicated way to buy a book! It\u2019s not trustless, you\u2019re trusting in the software (and your ability to defend yourself in a software-driven world), instead of trusting other people.\u201cI\u2019d rather look at the source code to make sure he didn\u2019t vote twice.\u201dAnother example: the purported advantages for a voting system in a weakly-governed country. \u201cKeep your voting records in a tamper-proof repository not owned by anyone\u201d sounds right \u2014 yet is your Afghan villager going to download the blockchain from a broadcast node and decrypt the Merkle root from his Linux command line to independently verify that his vote has been counted? Or will he rely on the mobile app of a trusted third party \u2014 like the nonprofit or open-source consortium administering the election or providing the software?These sound like stupid examples \u2014 novelists and villagers hiring e-bodyguard hackers to protect them from malicious customers and nonprofits whose clever smart-contracts might steal their money and votes?? \u2014 until you realize that\u2019s actually the point. Instead of relying on trust or regulation, in the blockchain world, individuals are on-purpose responsible for their own security precautions. And if the software they use is malicious or buggy, they should have read the software more carefully.The entire worldview underlying blockchain is wrongYou actually see it over and over again. Blockchain systems are supposed to be more trustworthy, but in fact they are the least trustworthy systems in the world. Today, in less than a decade, three successive top bitcoin exchanges have been hacked, another is accused of insider trading, the demonstration-project DAO smart contract got drained, crypto price swings are ten times those of the world\u2019s most mismanaged currencies, and bitcoin, the \u201ckiller app\u201d of crypto transparency, is almost certainly artificially propped up by fake transactions involving billions of literally imaginary dollars.How exactly does blockchain stop this guy from spraying pesticides?Blockchain systems do not magically make the data in them accurate or the people entering the data trustworthy, they merely enable you to audit whether it has been tampered with. A person who sprayed pesticides on a mango can still enter onto a blockchain system that the mangoes were organic. A corrupt government can create a blockchain system to count the votes and just allocate an extra million addresses to their cronies. An investment fund whose charter is written in software can still misallocate funds.How then, is trust created?In the case of buying an e-book, even if you\u2019re buying it with a smart contract, instead of auditing the software you\u2019ll rely on one of four things, each of them characteristics of the \u201cold way\u201d: either the author of the smart contract is someone you know of and trust, the seller of the e-book has a reputation to uphold, you or friends of yours have bought e-books from this seller in the past successfully, or you\u2019re just willing to hope that this person will deal fairly. In each case, even if the transaction is effectuated via a smart contract, in practice you\u2019re relying on trust of a counterparty or middleman, not your self-protective right to audit the software, each man an island unto himself. The contract still works, but the fact that the promise is written in auditable software rather than government-enforced English makes it less transparent, not more transparent.The same for the vote counting. Before blockchain can even get involved, you need to trust that voter registration is done fairly, that ballots are given only to eligible voters, that the votes are made anonymously rather than bought or intimidated, that the vote displayed by the balloting system is the same as the vote recorded, and that no extra votes are given to the political cronies to cast. Blockchain makes none of these problems easier and many of them harder\u2014but more importantly, solving them in a blockchain context requires a set of awkward workarounds that undermine the core premise. So we know the entries are valid, let\u2019s allow only trusted nonprofits to make entries\u2014and you\u2019re back at the good old \u201cclassic\u201d ledger. In fact, if you look at any blockchain solution, inevitably you\u2019ll find an awkward workaround to re-create trusted parties in a trustless world.A crypto-medieval systemYet absent these \u201cold way\u201d factors\u2014supposing you actually attempted to rely on blockchain\u2019s self-interest/self-protection to build a real system\u2014you\u2019d be in a real mess.The Knights Templar was sort of a banking system, actually.Eight hundred years ago in Europe \u2014 with weak governments unable to enforce laws and trusted counterparties few, fragile and far between \u2014 theft was rampant, safe banking was a fantasy, and personal security was at the point of the sword. This is what Somalia looks like now, and also, what it looks like to transact on the blockchain in the ideal scenario.Somalia on purpose. That\u2019s the vision. Nobody wants it!Even the most die-hard crypto enthusiasts prefer in practice to rely on trust rather than their own crypto-medieval systems. 93% of bitcoins are mined by managed consortiums, yet none of the consortiums use smart contracts to manage payouts. Instead, they promise things like a \u201clong history of stable and accurate payouts.\u201d Sounds like a trustworthy middleman!Trusted sellers of stolen credit cards and cocaine.Same with Silk Road, a cryptocurrency-driven online drug bazaar. The key to Silk Road wasn\u2019t the bitcoins (that was just to evade government detection), it was the reputation scores that allowed people to trust criminals. And the reputation scores weren\u2019t tracked on a tamper-proof blockchain, they were tracked by a trusted middleman!If Ripple, Silk Road, Slush Pool, and the DAO all prefer \u201cold way\u201d systems of creating and enforcing trust, it\u2019s no wonder that the outside world had not adopted trustless systems either!In the name of all blockchain stands for, it\u2019s time to abandon blockchainA decentralized, tamper-proof repository sounds like a great way to audit where your mango comes from, how fresh it is, and whether it has been sprayed with pesticides or not. But actually, laws on food labeling, nonprofit or government inspectors, an independent, trusted free press, empowered workers who trust whistleblower protections, credible grocery stores, your local nonprofit farmer\u2019s market, and so on, do a way better job. People who actually care about food safety do not adopt blockchain because trusted is better than trustless. Blockchain\u2019s technology mess exposes its metaphor mess \u2014 a software engineer pointing out that storing the data a sequence of small hashed files won\u2019t get the mango-pickers to accurately report whether they sprayed pesticides is also pointing out why peer-to-peer interaction with no regulations, norms, middlemen, or trusted parties is actually a bad way to empower people.Smarter produce in under 2.2 secondsLike the farmer\u2019s market or the organic labeling standard, so many real ideas are hiding in plain sight. Do you wish there was a type of financial institution that was secure and well-regulated in all the traditional ways, but also has the integrity of being people-powered? A credit union\u2019s members elect its directors, and the transaction-processing revenue is divided up among the members. Move your money! Prefer a deflationary monetary policy? Central bankers are appointed by elected leaders. Want to make elections more secure and democratic? Help write open source voting software, go out and register voters, or volunteer as an election observer here or abroad! Wish there was a trusted e-book delivery service that charged lower transaction fees and distributed more of the earnings to the authors? You can already consider stated payout rates when you buy music or books, buy directly from the authors, or start your own e-book site that\u2019s even better than what\u2019s out there!Projects based on the elimination of trust have failed to capture customers\u2019 interest because trust is actually so damn valuable. A lawless and mistrustful world where self-interest is the only principle and paranoia is the only source of safety is a not a paradise but a crypto-medieval hellhole.As a society, and as technologists and entrepreneurs in particular, we\u2019re going to have to get good at cooperating \u2014 at building trust, and, at being trustworthy. Instead of directing resources to the elimination of trust, we should direct our resources to the creation of trust\u2014whether we use a long series of sequentially hashed files as our storage medium or not.Kai Stinchcombe coined the terms \u201ccrypto-medieval\u201d \u201cfuturistic integrity wand\u201d and \u201csmart mango.\u201d Please use freely: coining terms makes you a futurist.", "responses": 856, "tags": ["Blockchain", "AI", "Cryptocurrency", "Bitcoin", "Smart Contracts"]}, {"title": "We already know blockchain\u2019s killer apps", "post_link": "https://medium.com/hackernoon/we-already-know-blockchains-killer-apps-f2d443eba35?source=search_post---------5", "author_name": "Haseeb Qureshi", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@hosseeb", "publish_date": "2017-10-31", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-21", "readtime": "24.1", "claps": 30963, "voters": 4518, "content": "We already know blockchain\u2019s killer appsHaseeb QureshiFollowOct 31, 2017 \u00b7 25 min readIt wasn\u2019t too long ago that Silicon Valley scoffed at cryptocurrencies. All over coffee shops in Mountain View and Menlo Park, you heard the same conversation: \u201cSure, it\u2019s cool technology, but when are we going to see the killer app\u201d?A few merchants dipped their toes into accepting Bitcoin in 2014. But adoption largely backed off. I remember seeing a few Bitcoin ATMs in Austin, and then they disappeared. Bitcoin reneged on its promise to replace cash, so most venture capitalists assumed it was dead on arrival. Without a killer app driving consumer adoption, cryptocurrencies seemed like they would be nothing more than a curiosity for cryptographers and paranoids.In the last year, interest in cryptocurrencies has skyrocketed. The public cryptocurrency market cap has surged to highs of over $170B. With over 1.5B raised through ICOs in 2017, over 70 crypto exchanges open for business, and crypto hedge funds and VCs popping up left and right, it seems that everyone is clambering to get a seat on the rocketship.In all this frenzy, nobody is asking about killer apps anymore.I believe this is a mistake.As a consumer technology, cryptocurrencies are a hot mess. They\u2019re extremely difficult to purchase, the networks are slow, the transaction fees are high, the community is full of trolls, hackers, and scammers, it\u2019s far too easy to lose your funds or have them stolen, and even if you win the battle to secure your funds or use a custodial service like Coinbase, merchant acceptance is scarce.The developer tools are even worse. The cryptocurrency ecosystem is fragmented and territorial. The tooling, documentation, and developer education are shoddy to nonexistent.Cryptocurrencies suck for both users and builders. Yet, despite these glaring problems, the demand and hype only go up.This should strike you as alarming. If it doesn\u2019t, you\u2019ve fallen asleep at the wheel.What does this mean?To make sense of this phenomenon, you\u2019re forced to one of two possible conclusions.The first is that the value of crypto is entirely in speculation.There\u2019s a lot of unfounded speculation in cryptocurrency markets, no doubt. Many of my close friends think cryptocurrencies are entirely a bubble. This kind of skepticism is a healthy perspective in a frothy market, but I\u2019d say this is too broad a claim.The other possibility is that crypto\u2019s underlying value is in something other than the user experience. But this seems to belie everything we know about how technological value creation takes place.The founder of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, argues that crypto won\u2019t have a killer app at all:\u2026 There will be no \u201ckiller app\u201d for blockchain technology. The reason for this is simple: the doctrine of low-hanging fruit. If there existed some particular application for which blockchain technology is massively superior to anything else \u2026 then people would be loudly talking about it already. \u2026 And so far, there has been no single application that anyone has come up with that has seriously stood out to dominate everything else on the horizon.\u201dVitalik Buterin (The Value of Blockchain Technology)Vitalik repudiates the \u201ckiller app\u201d framework. He believes that blockchain will become valuable for the many long-tail applications that it enables.I disagree.I think the \u201ckiller app\u201d framework is the correct one. While there are many cutting-edge applications that technologists will find exciting (myself included), the major drivers of blockchain\u2019s value are relatively narrow.Amidst the hype-train of ICOs, \u201cdecentralizing the Internet,\u201d and bullshit artists trying to hoist everything they can think of onto a blockchain, it\u2019s instructive to take the 1000-foot view and remind ourselves of the big picture.I argue there are four killer apps for blockchains:Dark web and black market paymentsDigital goldPayments (macro and micro)TokenizationKiller app #1: Dark web and black market paymentsMarket size (approx.): Billions to 10s of Billions USDWhat\u2019s blocking this? Privacy-coin development, scalingBitcoin has done a decent job of distancing itself from its roots. But the first and foremost killer app for cryptocurrencies has always been as a payments layer for those who require anonymity and censorship-resistance. Primarily, these have been users of the dark web.The dark web refers to recesses of the Internet that can only be accessed through special anonymizing protocols, such as Tor, I2P, and Freenet. Transactions that take place through dark web markets range from the relatively innocuous, like purchasing prescription drugs, all the way to hacked credential dumps, digital ransoms, firearms, and famously, assassinations.Before Bitcoin, dark web markets had a glaring problem. How can you perform payments between pseudonymous dark web buyers and sellers, on opposite sides of the world, when they don\u2019t trust each other and don\u2019t want anyone to know who they are?Bitcoin fit like a glove. It was global, trustless, pseudonymous, and (mostly) invulnerable to state actors. Bitcoin took off as the unofficial currency of dark web marketplaces like The Silk Road, AlphaBay, and their successors.Most of Bitcoin\u2019s usage is now relatively benign, but Bitcoin owes a large debt to the dark web. All cryptocurrencies need a bootstrapping phase before which they don\u2019t offer much security. The dark web brought the initial wave of users and miners into Bitcoin and breathed life into the ecosystem.By most estimates, the GMV of the dark web is over $1B a year. Of course, the dark web is a tiny portion of the overall black markets of the world. But as cryptocurrencies grow in adoption and usability, we\u2019ll see more black markets adopt cryptocurrencies as the standard medium of payment.Though Bitcoin was the first currency to play this role, newer currencies with stronger anonymity-preserving features like Monero and ZCash (and perhaps eventually Mimblewimble) are better positioned to become the de facto currencies of the dark web.Killer App #2: Digital GoldMarket size: Trillions+ USDWhat\u2019s blocking this? Volatility, consumer awarenessDepending on who you ask, describing Bitcoin as \u201cdigital gold\u201d can be taken as an insult or a declaration of victory.This term gets thrown around a lot, but what does it mean for something to be digital gold?The power of analog goldGold as a material is not intrinsically useful. Less than 10% of all the gold mined is used for any industrial or manufacturing purpose. Despite that, humans have converged on believing that gold is highly valuable.Why?Putting aside the primitive reasons why humans are attracted to gold, it has several nice economic properties. Gold is hard to mine and new deposits are found infrequently, so its supply undergoes relatively little inflation. Gold also doesn\u2019t tarnish or corrode, so existent gold will remain salable. This leads to minimal price fluctuations, making it appealing as a stable store of value. Furthermore, no market or state actor has a monopoly on gold, so its rises and falls are uncorrelated with any country. For these and other reasons, humans have agreed on gold as the Schelling Point for a static store of value.As this static store of value, gold serves as a hedge against global economic movements. Even as economies rise and fall, gold remains gold, and its movements are largely independent. Thus, for the last several thousand years, gold has served as our globally decentralized store of value. It\u2019s valuable because we all agree to use it that way.But gold, it turns out, is far from the ideal store of value. Gold bars are big and heavy. Gold is expensive to house and guard. It\u2019s difficult to transport. It can be stolen and manipulated. You can easily lie about having gold, or the purity of that gold.Still, a first-world citizen might well ask \u2014 what\u2019s the big deal? I can buy some bits of gold if I need to, and if I\u2019m desperate to keep my money safe, I can just deposit my funds into a bank.Why digital gold is so importantMost first-world citizens don\u2019t grasp just how much of the world does not have either 1) secure banking infrastructure, or 2) functioning gold markets. When your currency is inflating due to governmental instability, when currency controls prevent you from divesting from the volatile local currency, when the banking infrastructure is too weak to trust local banks, and when the state is corrupt or incompetent, one of the few ways to secure your wealth is to invest it in gold. And in a lot of places, that\u2019s very difficult to do safely.For many of my software developer friends who\u2019ve only ever lived in the United States, it\u2019s hard to imagine having such a deep mistrust of one\u2019s government or economy.If you use human development index (HDI) as a proxy for what portion of the world is highly-developed, the UN lists about 50 nations as being in the \u201cvery high human development\u201d category, including the U.S., most of Europe, Japan, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, and Russia. The least developed of these highly-developed economies in currently Kuwait. The highly developed countries in total comprise only 15% of the world\u2019s population.In other words, 85% of the world\u2019s population lives in places less developed than Kuwait. In the US, with a stable currency like the USD, with robust financial infrastructure and layers of technology on top of it (Visa, Paypal, Venmo, etc.), it\u2019s hard to imagine what the value-add of Bitcoin would be. But much of Bitcoin\u2019s value is going to be delivered to the other 85% of the world.Technologists have been chasing after digital gold for a long time. Many schemes have been tried, including e-gold and e-Bullion (both with gold-backed reserves), or DigiCash, which aimed to be a centralized digital currency.They all failed. Bitcoin is the first digital currency to ever truly succeed at this.Isn\u2019t Bitcoin too volatile to replace gold?You might argue that a currency that fluctuates by 15% on a normal day cannot possibly replace gold. This is a fair point. Bitcoin has not yet been able to serve as a stable store of value. But Bitcoin does not need to immediately replace gold. For now, it simply needs to complement it.Stability is only one of the many properties that gold serves in a market. For those who require stability, stablecoins like Tether, BitUSD, or the upcoming Basecoin can satisfy that niche. Five or ten years from now, after the hype and speculation simmer down and Bitcoin becomes a boringly well-understood financial asset, its price will stabilize.In fact, as Chris Burniske points out, Bitcoin is already about as volatile as oil, and less volatile than many S&P 500 equities.Bitcoin is now about 5\u20136 times more volatile than gold, and the gap is gradually closing.Still, you might hear this and assume this is speculation. Bitcoin cannot yet act as digital gold, but people are buying it hoping it one day will.I\u2019d argue there are several reasons why, even with its volatility, Bitcoin is already a very effective form of digital gold.Why Bitcoin serves as digital goldFirst, Bitcoin\u2019s value is not dependent on any nation-state or any economy. In fact, Bitcoin has been shown to be almost entirely uncorrelated with any other asset class, including gold itself.Second, Bitcoin can be acquired and traded from anywhere in the world, regardless of local markets and banking infrastructure. This is key to being an effective destination for capital flight.These first two points could describe most cryptocurrencies, but there\u2019s a third and larger point that comes out in favor of Bitcoin in particular: Bitcoin, like gold, is very resistant to change.Unlike other cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin has seen surprisingly little innovation or evolution since its invention in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto. While protocols like Ethereum and Ripple have undergone significant and enterprising pivots in their roadmaps, Bitcoin and its community are ideologically committed to maintaining something close to its original design.Take Bitcoin\u2019s spectral creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. After single-handedly inventing and coding the first version of the Bitcoin protocol, Satoshi disappeared from the Bitcoin world in 2010. His absence imbues an almost religious reverence around the technology\u2019s initial specification, and many Bitcoiners are devoted to its technological immutability. This is furthered by the political deadlock among miners, developers, and users, who are all opposed to any of the other parties changing the balance of power.Bitcoin also has a stable roadmap for inflation and is mined at a predictable rate. It always produces on average one block every ten minutes. In almost all ways, Bitcoin is predictable. This is ideal for something to serve as \u201cdigital gold.\u201d Gold, by its nature, is predictable and doesn\u2019t change.Bitcoin has the most hashing power, and so is the most secure cryptocurrency. It\u2019s the most universal, the most liquid, the most ubiquitous, and has the smallest price movements of all cryptocurrencies (some stablecoins aside). It\u2019s also the simplest, and has the most brand awareness \u2014 both great properties for gold.As a payments layer, Bitcoin is slow, expensive, and unscalable. But if Bitcoin is to serve as digital gold, that doesn\u2019t matter. Bitcoin being hard to move around encourages people to treat it like gold. Almost all of the political and economic characteristics of Bitcoin make it the natural cryptocurrency to fill this niche.And it already does. In many jurisdictions, if someone wants to hedge against their local economy, escape currency controls, divest from a collapsing currency, or just commit some good old-fashioned tax evasion, Bitcoin is the most natural way to do it.Beyond economicsI\u2019ve often heard the argument: but gold is more than just the sum of its economic properties. There is a narrative valence around gold. Gold is the metal of kings, of legendary palaces, of ancient riches.Unlike Bitcoin, nobody needs to explain why gold is valuable. You don\u2019t need to round up bankers to expensive conferences and give them presentations on why gold is a good store of value. Gold is simple. Bitcoin is complicated. So in the long run, the argument goes, Bitcoin can never replace gold.This is nonsense.It\u2019s true that the stories we tell matter. But those stories can change. On the island of Yap the Yapese decided that large stone disks would be their store of value. Eventually, after the introduction of modern currencies, the Rai stones fell mostly out of use, and they now primarily transact with US dollar bills. Stories don\u2019t win over everything. Eventually, raw utility supplants tradition.Furthermore, gold has not always been as stable or as valuable as it is now. Oil once had the same physical aura and narrative valence as gold, but as other commodities started to overtake its utility, it became less valuable.If Bitcoin is a serious improvement over gold and starts to displace its role, the market will respond and re-price accordingly.I\u2019ll grant this though: gold\u2019s simplicity is a great feature. But Bitcoin is likewise the simplest cryptocurrency. You can explain the intuitions behind Bitcoin to any captive high schooler who has a basic grasp of probability and a moderate attention span. Bitcoin is also simple in that it can\u2019t do a lot. Its programmability is stunted at best, but this is just fine for a store of value.But this argument against technically complex money is ultimately a fallacy. Take credit cards.The first plastic credit card was issued in 1958. The magnetic stripe was introduced in 1970. By the mid-70s credit cards were totally pedestrian and ubiquitous in American society. How many people who transact with credit cards can explain what magnetism even is? Forget about knowing how their credit scores work.If a technology sufficiently improves over the status quo, people will habituate to it. In 2007, smartphones were exotic, futuristic gadgets. Ten years later, they\u2019re just a pedestrian necessity of modern life. If Bitcoin is cheaper, easier, and more ubiquitous, it will follow the same course \u2014 people will shrug it off the way they shrug off all the amazing technology that goes into their smartphone or their credit card.To the digital native of the future, Bitcoin wallets will probably seem more natural than vaults full of useless metals painstakingly drilled out of the earth.How does Bitcoin size up to the gold market right now?Gold is a 3\u20136 trillion dollar market depending on how you do the accounting, and its daily trading volume is between 70 and 200 billion dollars per day. Let\u2019s use the most conservative sizing of 3T market cap, and 70B dollars a day.On January 1st this year, Bitcoin was at 0.5% of gold\u2019s market cap, and its trading volume was 0.1% of gold\u2019s trading volume. Today, Bitcoin is 3.3% of gold by market cap, and 3.1% of its trading volume.This trend will likely continue. And I suspect that once Bitcoin starts to seriously gain on gold, four things will happen.Nation states will panic and increase their backlash against cryptocurrencies.Gold markets will start to fall.There will be increased attempts to regulate Bitcoin to protect the interests of gold holders.Bitcoin will stop being taken seriously as a contender for the blockchain payments layer.(Of course, my guess is as good as anyone\u2019s and I\u2019m far from an expert, so take this all with a healthy serving of salt.)Killer App #3: Payments (macro and micro)Market size: Hundreds of billions USDWhat\u2019s blocking this? Adoption, ease of use, scalingSo long as cryptocurrencies require their users to have impeccable key management, blockchains can\u2019t solve the peer-to-peer payments problem. Dark web regulars might be able to take the time and risk to navigate all the technical complexity. But for blockchains to work in the above-ground economy, you need more than theoretical security \u2014 you need actual, in-the-wild security. Money needs to be so easy to use that the average person on the street won\u2019t fuck it up and expose themselves to danger.Right now, most people are far below that level of technical competence. Until that happens or we can figure out a good abstraction layer, cryptocurrencies will not be tenable for a consumer peer-to-peer payments system.Parallel to this, many economies are making big leaps forward in the ease of traditional payments. Look at Venmo in the U.S., M-Pesa in Africa, or AliPay and WeChat Pay in China. Traditional fintech is moving fast enough that its advances will easily overtake blockchain in the short to medium term on this front.In both adoption and ease of use, cryptocurrencies are far behind the traditional banking system. But there are two use cases where cryptocurrencies are far ahead.International paymentsSay I want to send $20,000 to a vendor in India. To transfer this amount of money, I would need to perform a bank wire (which usually costs ~$50 in fees), wait several days for all of the cogs of the banking infrastructure to grind through the transaction, until it finally arrives in India. On top of this, our respective banks may charge their own unfavorable rates for exchanging between currencies. And this is assuming that everything works as expected.Alternatively, I could send the vendor $20,000 worth of Ether in one transaction on the Ethereum blockchain. On an average day, the transaction would be finalized on the blockchain in less than 10 minutes, and the transaction fees would be around 50 cents. Note that Ethereum is not a blockchain that\u2019s optimized for payments, so both the latency and the transaction fee could be orders of magnitude lower.In terms of simplicity, speed, and transaction fees, blockchains are without peer when it comes to international payments. There are still regulatory and technical problems that get in the way of mass adoption, but a lot of what\u2019s standing in the way is simply knowledge, trust, and the optics of transacting in cryptocurrencies.The other area of payments where blockchains are moving far ahead of the competition is in micropayments.MicropaymentsWith traditional financial networks (taking Visa as the canonical example), any monetary transfer incurs fees of at least 20 cents. This means it\u2019s infeasible to transact any amount less than 20 cents, and at 50 cents, a seller would be sacrificing 40% of their revenue to Visa.This renders most micropayment schemes untenable on traditional payments networks. A lot of otherwise innovative business models are simply ruled out. What if you wanted to create a blogging service that charged 25c to read past the fold? Tough luck \u2014 after payment processing fees, it wouldn\u2019t be worth the HTML it was printed on.There has been one nominal solution for this: namely, maintaining an internal ledger. This is what advertising companies do. Google might pay you a cent for someone clicking through an ad on your website, but it\u2019s not going to directly pay you that cent \u2014 instead, it marks down that cent in its internal database, and then settles up with you on a monthly basis.This is really just micro-accounting. True micro-payments would imply that I don\u2019t need an account with the New York Times, I can just pay for an article without ever signing in or having a long-term subscription.Blockchains can solve this problem. Take Dash, a cryptocurrency optimized for payments. It currently features median transaction fees of 1\u20133 cents, with an average block time of 3 seconds. With Dash, a 25 cent fee per article would mean only 10% of the revenue would go to transaction fees. (I have many reservations about Dash, but it does demonstrate the potential of a payments-optimized currency.)With Bitcoin or Ethereum, Lightning Network and state channels can get us closer to the dream of true micro-payments. There\u2019s quite a bit more complexity to making these work, so we\u2019re probably at least a couple years away from building all the requisite infrastructure and developer tools. For more about Lightning Network and how it works, check out this blog post.Banks on defenseThere are a lot of experiments going on in this space, and it\u2019ll be a while before we\u2019ll know how they shake out. But make no mistake of it: banks are afraid. They can see the marauders coming over the hill and the catapults being wheeled slowly behind them.Banks may be able to protect their market share if they adopt blockchains. Already many banks are experimenting with Ripple, R3, Hyperledger, and other blockchain solutions to improve their clearing times and lower fees. But cryptocurrencies are preparing to launch an all-out attack against the market share of traditional banks, and the banks have woken up to this. A battle is coming, and it won\u2019t be bloodless.It\u2019s going to be an interesting next few years.Killer App #4: TokenizationMarket size: ???What\u2019s blocking this? Regulation, legal frameworksNick Szabo first coined the term \u201csmart contract\u201d in 1996. It would be 19 years later in Ethereum, the first Turing-complete smart contracts platform, that smart contracts would reach their potential.Many Ethereum proponents claim that with the advent of smart contracts, the writing is on the wall for traditional commerce. Supposedly everything will become decentralized, rent-seeking oligopolies will be abolished, and before we know it, the entire world will be mediated by smart contracts.For now, you can rest assured this is science fiction. Smart contract schemes can be postulated for just about anything, but in most domains there are still glaring problems. The users aren\u2019t there, the UX isn\u2019t there, the scaling isn\u2019t there, the incentives aren\u2019t there, the regulation isn\u2019t there, and even if they all were \u2014 in most cases, the value proposition is tenuous. Most people just don\u2019t care about the benefits of smart contracts or decentralization. For most problems, blockchain is more of a hindrance than a help.Though there\u2019s much innovation in this space, it\u2019s all highly experimental, and killer use cases for smart contracts have yet to be proven.The one exception to this is tokenization.Tokenization is the killer app of EthereumEthereum was the first currency to democratize ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings). Creating a new digital token has become as easy as copy and pasting a smart contract, fiddling with a few variables, and deploying it into the blockchain.(Some say if you listen closely enough, you can hear a new shitcoin being born every minute.)AWS is to the web app as Ethereum is to the token. And while this has enabled a great Renaissance of technological speculation (read: ICO bubble), one would be wise to disentangle the medium from the message.The pro-token argument is somewhat subtle, and it has many detractors. Let me first lay out the case, and then the best arguments against it (looking at you, Preston Byrne).First, what do we mean by tokenization?There are two kinds of tokenization: protocol tokenization and asset tokenization.Protocol TokenizationConsider BitTorrent.I\u2019m guessing most of you have used BitTorrent before. To be clear, BitTorrent is not an application \u2014 it\u2019s a protocol, which all BitTorrent clients implement. Specifically, BitTorrent is a peer-to-peer protocol that allows users to obtain files from a swarm of other peers. While you download files, you also upload the chunks you\u2019ve already downloaded. And if you\u2019re a good user, after you\u2019re done downloading you\u2019ll continue to upload, which pays the bandwidth forward to other users.There\u2019s an obvious weakness in this protocol \u2014 the free rider problem. Someone can download less than they upload and refuse to pay it forward. BitTorrent\u2019s solution to this is\u2026\u2026 well, it doesn\u2019t really have one. It tries to throttle the download speed of free riders, but this doesn\u2019t work very well. Some torrenters tried to solve this problem by creating invite-only communities with persistent reputation, but most users prefer to use BitTorrent in total anonymity. Without any incentives around the exchange of bandwidth, BitTorrent is vulnerable to this tragedy of the commons. If BitTorrent functions well, it\u2019s only because its citizens happen to be well-behaved.Good will doesn\u2019t scaleThomas Hobbes long ago predicted that to make a society function at massive scale, you need the right incentives in place.Traditionally, we have used a Leviathan to enforce these incentives. By propping up a central authority (usually the state, or in BitTorrent\u2019s case, a centralized identity service), you can force each actor in a system to behave \u2014 other than the Leviathan itself, of course.Modern democratic theory arose in response to precisely this problem: given that you need a central authority to enforce incentives, how can you prevent that authority from itself becoming corrupt and misbehaving? By default, each actor\u2019s incentive is to exploit its own power. So we invented elections, we invented constitutions, we invented checks and balances and impeachment proceedings. We did all this to try to cage the Leviathan, to prevent the inevitable drift of central authorities toward corruption and rent-seeking.Up until now, central authorities are the best solution we\u2019ve come up with to this problem.But protocol tokens may now change that. They may offer us a new way to solve incentive alignment problems.Protocol tokens, such as Filecoin, serve as an intra-protocol incentive scheme. By calibrating the incentives and how they align with the token, you can create a protocol just like BitTorrent where instead of merely hoping users do the right thing, you pay them to do the right thing. And instead of hoping users aren\u2019t assholes, you charge them money to be assholes.By programmatically aligning incentives and creating the right payoff matrix, a protocol can use economics and game theory to incent users toward the desired protocol behavior. Design the incentives right, and almost magically, everything falls into place and the economy runs smoothly. No central authority required, no checks or balances, no elections or impeachments, no laws or courts. The incentives simply work without them.(The analogy I\u2019m making between pay-to-play BitTorrent and Filecoin is a loose one, but nevertheless instructive.)Decentralized regulationThe purpose of most regulation is to tweak incentives such that a system behaves in a way that\u2019s globally optimal. But normal regulation is enforced by humans, and is therefore mutable. If a company bribes or cajoles its regulators, regulators will often look the other way. And if a company has enough money or political clout, it can lobby for those regulations to be overturned.Decentralized regulation is immune to regulatory capture or political pressure. Normal regulators can be bribed or bullied by monopoly powers, but decentralized regulation is built into the code.And crucially, decentralized regulation can be mathematically examined for its soundness. Real-world regulation is much harder to analyze \u2014 its specifications are fuzzy, and its thousands of edge cases must be expensively adjudicated in courts of law.Economists have long day-dreamed about problems that could be solved by market mechanisms. The laboratory has been opened, and by simply issuing a coin and a few rules, you are free to run your own cryptoeconomic experiment.So this is the first kind of tokenization. It\u2019s real, and almost everyone who understands it can see that it\u2019s a big idea. It might be a long ways away before it becomes mainstream. But there\u2019s a good chance that the successor of the web will be accessed via a digital token.Asset TokenizationThe second form of tokenization, asset tokenization, is the process of taking a traditionally illiquid asset and transforming it into fungible shares on a blockchain. Those shares can be traded on a trustless marketplace to enable their liquidity.When you hear this, you should be skeptical. As Preston Byrne points out, you can already do all of that \u2014 it\u2019s called IPOing then issuing shares on a stock exchange. What\u2019s the value-add of doing this on a blockchain?Obviously, there already exist centralized exchanges like the NYSE that enable trading of \u201ctokenized assets,\u201d i.e., shares of company stock.That said, it\u2019s very expensive to get listed on the NYSE (the average company incurs about $3.7M to get listed). Foreign investors have to jump through expensive hoops to invest in American assets, and vice versa. There are large regulatory and legal barriers here which prevent the free flow of capital. (Granted, most of these barriers exist for good reasons. But there are also layers of waste and rent-seeking that have accrued on most of these processes.)(One glaring example of this is GBTC, a publicly traded Bitcoin investment vehicle \u2014 essentially a trust that holds Bitcoin \u2014 which is twice as expensive to purchase as just buying the equivalent Bitcoins directly.)There are also many types of assets that cannot be traded through these exchanges. With stock markets, we have invented schemes to divide a company into fungible shares and trade them openly on markets. But we have yet to do so with real estate, fine art, or other assets generally considered to be valuable or value-producing.Preston Byrne argues: well, effectively what you\u2019re saying is that \u201ctokenization onto a blockchain allows you to break securities laws.\u201d That\u2019s hardly an innovation so much as a circumvention.This I grant. But there are other benefits to tokenized assets, for which decentralization is the prerequisite.The benefits of decentralized token marketsThe first benefit is that with a decentralized, tokenized market, you no longer need to trust any central intermediary. If you live in a country where your state institutions and financial infrastructure are weak or corrupt, then so long as you have access to the Internet, you\u2019ll be able to participate in a robust and liquid global market for tokenized assets.The second reason is that there are major startup costs to creating a well-functioning marketplace.Here\u2019s a toy example: consider FarmVille. FarmVille has many in-game assets \u2014 money, in-game items, whatever. Those assets live squarely in Zynga\u2019s databases. Presumably FarmVille players value these assets, so buyers and sellers would willingly engage in a marketplace for them.However, to enable that marketplace, Zynga would have to invest in building and managing an exchange that integrates with its database. In reality, Zynga doesn\u2019t want this for PR and regulatory reasons \u2014 but let\u2019s ignore that for the moment. Even if they wanted to build it, creating this fully-featured exchange would be significant engineering work.That\u2019s just FarmVille. There are thousands of games like this that have fervent demand for in-game assets, but for each of them to have a functioning marketplace, each gaming company would have to reduplicate the efforts to build a secure and feature-complete exchange. And if any such company builds their exchange insecurely, or decides that it\u2019s no longer in the company\u2019s interest to maintain it, the exchange would go down and the asset-holders would ultimately eat the cost of illiquidity.A blockchain solves these problems. If you issue your assets as a token on a blockchain to begin with, then you inherit an enormous shared infrastructure for managing and maintaining markets. Assuming you use a common token specification like ERC20, then you can use smart contracts to easily create financial deals or instruments across different tokens, trustlessly atomically swap them, create simple escrow contracts, or use an automatic price discovery mechanism like Bancor to bootstrap liquidity. Exchanges could seamlessly list your tokens and allow anyone to purchase it with any other token with just a few lines of code. And with blockchain-based insurance, eventually you may be able to take out a loan for a car based on your portfolio of digital assets.We could call this whole suite of abilities a financial infrastructure as a service, created at no cost to the issuer, maintained entirely by the blockchain.These benefits further improve liquidity and market depths. When users trust that your exchange won\u2019t be shut down or censored (either by a state or by a company whose interests are no longer served) both buyers and sellers will be confident in trading the asset, and users will be more motivated to acquire it.When Peter McKeon lays these arguments out in his essay, he notes that most assets gain a 25% increase in value from being liquid. This is an enormous gain for the many illiquid assets in the global economy.Asset tokenization is a big deal, as are protocol tokens. Of course, there are a many problems we have to figure out before we can get there (both technical and regulatory), so we\u2019re likely several years away before these fully bear fruit. But if enough builders align to push them forward, these two forms of tokenization will lead to massive value creation.To summarizeI argue that the four killer apps of cryptocurrencies are 1) dark web and black market payments, 2) digital gold, 3) macro/micro payments, and 4) tokenization. If the recent surge of cryptocurrency market cap to 170B+ struck you as unbelievable, I hope after reading this, it will make more sense.That said, I don\u2019t want to disregard the other exciting ideas in this space. There are many promising applications that may prove to be killer apps on blockchains \u2014 social networks that pay their participants (Earn.com (which I\u2019m working on right now\u2014formerly 21.co), Steemit), decentralized prediction markets (Gnosis, Augur), decentralized storage networks (Filecoin, Maidsafe, Sia), to name just a few.This space is full of innovation and moving extremely fast.

And if there is a theme that emerged in the testimony, it is the significant role that big data analytics play in business success.It is no wonder that a good number of the world largest corporations including Facebook, Google, and Twitter are in the business of selling marketing insights. One area of big data analytics that has recently attracted a lot of attention from corporations, politicians, and government agencies in sentiment analysis.This method involves analyzing comments and suggestions left on social media sites and identifying their attitude towards a brand by using variables such as emotion, tone, and context. While the number of likes and followers a business gains on social media are essential, it is the users\u2019 reactions towards the brand or the product that counts. Firms must, therefore, understand the emotional and logical responses of their target audience to be able to market to them effectively.Sentiment analysis gives businesses insights to better understand the language of their target audiences and adjust their products and marketing approach accordingly. Politicians use it to understand what interests a specific voting bloc and create political campaigns to match their interests accordingly.While there is no doubt that big data analytics including sentiment analysis are of vital importance to businesses in this age of IoT, they aren\u2019t affordable to all. However, with blockchain, SMBs can now leverage big data analytics without having to worry about costs or compliance.For instance, SENNO, a Neo based platform, is the first combining blockchain and Artificial Neural Networks in sentiment analysis, allowing businesses to tap into the data at lower costs. Using this platform, businesses don\u2019t have to incur the costs of setting up big data infrastructure. They just need to connect to the SENNO network through an API, and and the sentiment analysis is done for them.Apart from lowering implementation costs, the project seeks to help businesses become compliant with big data regulatory requirements. In May this year, a new and very stringent big data regulation known as the GDPR will come into effect, impacting how businesses in Europe and all over the world collect and manage their users\u2019 data. The compliance is expected to be very costly, effectively locking out firms without the resources to comply out of the big data analytics game.However, with blockchain tech, businesses will be able to to enjoy big data\u2019s fruits at a lower cost and with all it\u2019s advantages. When it comes to data protection, blockchain offers the most advanced solutions as it applies encryption and hashing to protect data and is not easy to hack given its distributed nature. The only problem with the blockchain in relation to the GDPR is that data stored on it is not erasable.Nevertheless, with the rate at which blockchain tech is developing, there is no doubt that a solution to this challenge will be found.Either way, businesses tapping into blockchain solutions have nothing to worry about given that the burden of compliance is no longer on their shoulders. Also, with new solutions being developed, businesses will soon be able to leverage the power of AI without incurring the enormous costs involved in setting up and implementing an independent AI strategy.In marketing, artificial neural networks are involved to gather and extract actionable insights from big data. The best thing about these networks is that they can learn from data and therefore increase accuracy with time. In sentiment analysis, neural networks are responsible for identifying and classifying emotions in texts, therefore, enabling targeted marketing. As blockchain solutions for big data analytics continue to develop, SMBs will be able to use them to gain a competitive edge.", "responses": 275, "tags": ["Smb", "Blockchain", "Blockchain For Smbs", "Smb Blockchain", "Small Business"]}, {"title": "How does blockchain really work?

I built an app to show you.Sean HanFollowSep 4, 2017 \u00b7 4 min readAccording to Wikipedia, a blockchain is:A distributed database that is used to maintain a continuously growing list of records, called blocks.That sounds nice, but how does it work?To illustrate a blockchain, we will use an open source command-line interface called Blockchain CLI.I also built a browser-based version of this here.Installing the Command-Line Interface versionIf you haven\u2019t already, install Node.js.Then run the following in your terminal:# Clone this repository$ git clone https://github.com/seanseany/blockchain-cli# Go into the repository$ cd blockchain-cli# Install dependencies$ npm install# Run the app$ npm startYou should see \ud83d\udc4b Welcome to Blockchain CLI!and a blockchain \u2192 prompt ready to take commands.What does a block look like?To see your current blockchain, enter blockchain or bc into the command prompt. You should see a block like the image below.A block on the blockchainIndex (Block #): Which block is it? (Genesis block has index 0)Hash: Is the block valid?Previous Hash: Is the previous block valid?Timestamp: When was the block added?Data: What information is stored on the block?Nonce: How many iterations did we go through before we found a valid block?Genesis BlockEvery blockchain will start with the\ud83c\udfc6 Genesis Block. As you will see later, each block on the blockchain is dependent on the previous block. So, the Genesis block is needed to mine our first block.What happens when a new block is mined?Let\u2019s mine our first block. Enter mine freeCodeCamp\u2665\ufe0e into the prompt.The blockchain looks at the latest block on the blockchain for the index and previous hash. In this case Genesis block is the latest block.Index: o+1 = 1Previous Hash: 0000018035a828da0\u2026Timestamp: When the block is addedData: freeCodeCamp\u2764Hash: ??Nonce: ??How is the hash calculated?A hash value is a numeric value of a fixed length that uniquely identifies data.The hash is calculated by taking the index, previous block hash, timestamp, block data, and nonce as input.CryptoJS.SHA256(index + previousHash + timestamp + data + nonce)The SHA256 algorithm will calculate a unique hash, given those inputs. The same inputs will always return the same hash.Did you notice the four leading 0\u2019s in the block hash?The four leading 0\u2019s is a minimum requirement for a valid hash. The number of leading 0\u2019s required is called difficulty.function isValidHashDifficulty(hash, difficulty) {  for (var i = 0, b = hash.length; i < b; i ++) {      if (hash[i] !== '0') {          break;      }  }  return i >= difficulty;}This is also known as the Proof-of-Work system.What\u2019s a nonce?A nonce is a number used to find a valid hash.let nonce = 0;let hash;let input;while(!isValidHashDifficulty(hash)) {       nonce = nonce + 1;  input = index + previousHash + timestamp + data + nonce;  hash = CryptoJS.SHA256(input)}The nonce iterates until the hash is valid. In our case, a valid hash has at least four leading 0\u2019s. The process of finding a nonce that corresponds to a valid hash is mining.As the difficulty increases, the number of possible valid hashes decreases. With less possible valid hashes, it takes more processing power to find a valid hash.Why does this matter?It matters because it keeps the blockchain immutable.If we have the following blockchain A \u2192 B \u2192 C, and someone wants to change data on Block A. This is what happens:Data changes on Block A.Block A\u2019s hash changes because data is used to calculate the hash.Block A becomes invalid because its hash no longer has four leading 0\u2019s.Block B\u2019s hash changes because Block A\u2019s hash was used to calculate Block B\u2019s hash.Block B becomes invalid because its hash no longer has four leading 0's.Block C\u2019s hash changes because Block B\u2019s hash was used to calculate Block C\u2019s hash.Block C becomes invalid because its hash no longer has four leading 0's.The only way to mutate a block would be to mine the block again, and all the blocks after. Since new blocks are always being added, it\u2019s nearly impossible to mutate the blockchain.I hope this tutorial was helpful for you!If you would like to checkout a web version of the demo, head on over to http://blockchaindemo.io", "responses": 118, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Cryptocurrency", "JavaScript", "Tech", "Startup"]}, {"title": "How Blockchain is Taking Gaming to a Whole New Level", "post_link": "https://medium.com/aerum-technologies/how-blockchain-is-taking-gaming-to-a-whole-new-level-5de0eb10256?source=search_post---------9", "author_name": "Samuel Miller", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@samiam034", "publish_date": "2018-10-23", "last_modified_date": "2018-10-23", "readtime": "3.14", "claps": 14116, "voters": 3580, "content": "How Blockchain is Taking Gaming to a Whole New LevelSamuel MillerFollowOct 23, 2018 \u00b7 4 min readBlockchain technology encompasses so much more than just cryptocurrencies these days. And while these currencies are by far blockchain\u2019s most famous use case, the potential for blockchain far, far exceeds a straightforward transfer of value.The gaming industry, for example, has always been fairly controversial due to a range of issues. Many players feel particularly worried about the protection of their data, fraudulent activities, high fees, and most of all, unfair and hidden odds.In these cases, P2P doesn\u2019t just mean peer-to-peer; it means player-to-player. As with the other P2P industries that blockchain is disrupting, such as FinTech, there are already plenty of ways in which blockchain technology is being applied to resolve these issues and many more of the challenges faced by the gaming industry. Here are just a few.Reducing fraudThe gaming industry suffers a lot from online fraud. One of the main advantages of blockchain technology is that it enables highly secure data encryption. What\u2019s more, all of it is entirely accessible and transparent to the player. In other words, blockchain is a for game changer for venues such as online casinos, lotteries, and virtually anything which relies on random number generation.On top of this, hackers will have particularly hard time, if it is even possible, to destroy a decentralized blockchain network, making sure gamer data stays safe. This is an inherent feature of distributed ledger technology whereby nodes in the ledger maintain the distributed databases in a shared manner, and each node has the complete information in the entire database.Making In-Game Purchases a Lot EasierIn-game purchases are particularly popular and are currently one of the main ways for game developers to monetize their growing user base, keeping them in business and keeping players playing.Allowing players to purchase in-game assets using a dedicated cryptocurrency eliminates the intermediaries and delays. In other words, players will be able to purchase their in-game items instantly, and at a reduced cost.Unique Interoperable Player ProfilesIf the game is developed on the blockchain, its players will be able to take their unique public address from one game to another. This means that they will be able to transact with their cryptocurrencies across different games from the same public address.This creates incredible flexibility and cross-platform interoperability which far exceeds the capabilities and constraints of existing centralized solutions.Total Asset OwnershipIn the majority of the existing gaming solutions, the players don\u2019t really own their in-game purchases. A distinct benefit of blockchain games is that they allow players to truly hold ownership of their assets by using smart contracts in order to govern in-game transactions.These smart contracts are executed automatically upon fulfilling the pre-set conditions and, as with any other smart contract, the results cannot be reversed.In other words, when you launch a blockchain-powered game, all of the in-game assets that the users have bought through smart contracts are immediately transferred to their public address. Another distinct benefit here is that these smart contracts allow for full transparency and every player can easily take a look at the implied rules.AERUM: A Blockchain Fit for the ChallengeOne of the biggest challenges faced by blockchain gaming is speed. The majority of the existing networks are just too slow for serious gaming. Take a real world example: in a real-time multiplayer game, even a very simple action can easily trigger a cascade of state changes. But because existing blockchains are too slow, even this simple action can take a serious toll on the frame-rate because every single state change has to be verified on the blockchain.Here\u2019s where AERUM comes in.AERUM\u2019s network is blazing fast. Compared to the competition, AERUM provides incredibly high-performance with a quick 2 second block time and real-time transaction execution in less than 5 seconds.The network also delivers virtually unlimited, on-demand scalability being able to handle 500 to 100,000+ transactions-per-second. It is 100% compatible with the industry forerunner Ethereum, while, at the same time offering 25x better throughput. AERUM also features end-to-end integration with Ethereum, guaranteeing easy and secure transfers thanks to cross-chain atomic swaps.You can read more about the AERUM network on its official website or stay tuned on the project\u2019s Facebook or Twitter page.

It allows value exchange without the need for trust or a central authority. Imagine you and I bet $50 on tomorrow\u2019s weather in San Francisco. I bet it will be sunny, you that it will rain. Today we have three options to manage this transaction:We can trust each other. Rainy or sunny, the loser will give $50 to the winner. If we are friends, this could be a good way of managing it. However, friends or strangers, one can easily not pay the other.We can turn the bet into a contract. With a contract in place both parties will be more prone to pay. However, should either of the two decide not to pay, the winner will have to pay additional money to cover legal expenses and the court case might take a long time. Especially for a small amount of cash, this doesn\u2019t seem like the optimal way to manage the transaction.We can involve a neutral third party. Each of us gives $50 to a third party, who will give the total amount to the winner. But hey, she could also run away with all our money. So we end up with one of the first two options: trust or contract.Neither trust nor contract is an optimal solution: We can\u2019t trust strangers, and enforcing a contract requires time and money. The blockchain technology is interesting because it offers us a third option which is secure, quick, and cheap.Blockchain allows us to write a few lines of code, a program running on the blockchain, to which both of us send $50. This program will keep the $100 safe and check tomorrow\u2019s weather automatically on several data sources. Sunny or rainy, it will automatically transfer the whole amount to the winner. Each party can check the contract logic, and once it\u2019s running on the blockchain it can\u2019t be changed or stopped. This may be too much effort for a $50 bet, but imagine selling a house or a company.This article explains how the blockchain works without discussing the technical details in depth, but by digging just enough to give you a general idea of the underlying logic and mechanisms.Also available in Simplified Chinese and Mandarin thanks to volunteering efforts and blockchain community support.The Basics of BitcoinImages courtesy of author.The most known and discussed application of the blockchain technology is bitcoin, a digital currency that can be used to exchange products and services, just like the U.S. dollar, euro, Chinese yuan, and other national currencies. Let\u2019s use this first application of the blockchain technology to learn how it works.\u201cBitcoin gives us, for the first time, a way for one Internet user to transfer a unique piece of digital property to another Internet user, such that the transfer is guaranteed to be safe and secure, everyone knows that the transfer has taken place, and nobody can challenge the legitimacy of the transfer. The consequences of this breakthrough are hard to overstate.\u201d\u2014 Marc AndreessenOne bitcoin is a single unit of the Bitcoin (BTC) digital currency. Just like a dollar, a bitcoin has no value by itself; it has value only because we agree to trade goods and services to bring more of the currency under our control, and we believe others will do the same.To keep track of the amount of bitcoin each of us owns, the blockchain uses a ledger, a digital file that tracks all bitcoin transactions.Fig. 1 - Bitcoin ledger digital file simplifiedThe ledger file is not stored in a central entity server, like a bank, or in a single data center. It is distributed across the world via a network of private computers that are both storing data and executing computations. Each of these computers represents a \u201cnode\u201d of the blockchain network and has a copy of the ledger file.If David wants to send bitcoins to Sandra, he broadcasts a message to the network that says the amount of bitcoin in his account should go down by 5 BTC, and the amount in Sandra\u2019s account should increase by the same quantity. Each node in the network will receive the message and apply the requested transaction to its copy of the ledger, updating the account balances.Fig. 2 - Transaction request message simplifiedThe fact that the ledger is maintained by a group of connected computers rather than by a centralized entity like a bank has several implications:In our bank system we only know our own transactions and account balances; on the blockchain everyone can see everyone else\u2019s transactions.While you can generally trust your bank, the bitcoin network is distributed and if something goes wrong there is no help desk to call or anyone to sue.The blockchain system is designed in such a way that no trust is needed; security and reliability are obtained via special mathematical functions and code.We can define the blockchain as a system that allows a group of connected computers to maintain a single updated and secure ledger. In order to perform transactions on the blockchain, you need a wallet, a program that allows you to store and exchange your bitcoins. Since only you should be able to spend your bitcoins, each wallet is protected by a special cryptographic method that uses a unique pair of distinct but connected keys: a private and a public key.If a message is encrypted with a specific public key, only the owner of the paired private key can decrypt and read the message. The reverse is also true: If you encrypt a message with your private key, only the paired public key can decrypt it. When David wants to send bitcoins, he needs to broadcast a message encrypted with the private key of his wallet. As David is the only one who knows the private key necessary to unlock his wallet, he is the only one who can spend his bitcoins. Each node in the network can cross-check that the transaction request is coming from David by decrypting the message with the public key of his wallet.When you encrypt a transaction request with your wallet\u2019s private key, you are generating a digital signature that is used by blockchain computers to verify the source and authenticity of the transaction. The digital signature is a string of text resulting from your transaction request and your private key; therefore it cannot be used for other transactions. If you change a single character in the transaction request message, the digital signature will change, so no potential attacker can change your transaction requests or alter the amount of bitcoin you are sending.Fig. 3 - Digital Signature transaction encryption simplifiedTo send bitcoin you need to prove that you own the private key of a specific wallet as you need the key to encrypt your transaction request message. Since you broadcast the message only after it has been encrypted, you never have to reveal your private key.Tracking Your Wallet BalanceEach node in the blockchain is keeping a copy of the ledger. So, how does a node know your account balance? The blockchain system doesn\u2019t keep track of account balances at all; it only records each and every transaction that is verified and approved. The ledger in fact does not keep track of balances, it only keeps track of every transaction broadcasted within the bitcoin network (Fig. 4). To determine your wallet balance, you need to analyze and verify all the transactions that ever took place on the whole network connected to your wallet.Fig. 4 - Blockchain LedgerThis \u201cbalance\u201d verification is performed based on links to previous transactions. In order to send 10 bitcoins to John, Mary has to generate a transaction request that includes links to previous incoming transactions that add up to at least 10 bitcoins. These links are called \u201cinputs.\u201d Nodes in the network verify the amount and ensure that these inputs haven\u2019t been spent yet. In fact, each time you reference inputs in a transaction, they are deemed invalid for any future transaction. This is all performed automatically in Mary\u2019s wallet and double-checked by the bitcoin network nodes; she only sends a 10 BTC transaction to John\u2019s wallet using his public key.Fig. 5 - Blockchain transaction request structureSo, how can the system trust that input transactions are valid? It checks all the previous transactions correlated to the wallet you use to send bitcoins via the input references. To speed up the verification process, a special record of unspent transactions is kept by the network nodes. Thanks to this security check, it is not possible to double-spend bitcoins.Owning bitcoins means that there are transactions written in the ledger that point to your wallet address and haven\u2019t been used as inputs yet. All the code to perform transactions on the bitcoin network is open source; this means that anyone with a laptop and an internet connection can operate transactions. However, should there be a mistake in the code used to broadcast a transaction request message, the associated bitcoins will be permanently lost.Remember that since the network is distributed, there is no customer support to call nor anyone who could help you restore a lost transaction or forgotten wallet password. For this reason, if you are interested in transacting on the bitcoin network, it\u2019s a good idea to use the open source and official version of bitcoin wallet software (such as Bitcoin Core), and to store your wallet\u2019s password or private key in a very safe repository.But Is It Really Safe? And Why Is It Called Blockchain?Anyone can access the bitcoin network via an anonymous connection (for example, the TOR network or a VPN network), and submit or receive transactions revealing nothing more than his public key. However if someone uses the same public key over and over, it\u2019s possible to connect all the transactions to the same owner. The bitcoin network allows you to generate as many wallets as you like, each with its own private and public keys. This allows you to receive payments on different wallets, and there is no way for anyone to know that you own all these wallets\u2019 private keys, unless you send all the received bitcoins to a single wallet.The total number of possible bitcoin addresses is 2\u00b9\u2076\u2070 or 1461501637330902918203684832716283019655932542976.This large number protects the network from possible attacks while allowing anyone to own a wallet.With this setup, there is still a major security hole that could be exploited to recall bitcoins after spending them. Transactions are passed from node to node within the network, so the order in which two transactions reach each node can be different. An attacker could send a transaction, wait for the counterpart to ship a product, and then send a reverse transaction back to his own account. In this case, some nodes could receive the second transaction before the first and therefore consider the initial payment transaction invalid, as the transaction inputs would be marked as already spent. How do you know which transaction has been requested first? It\u2019s not secure to order the transactions by timestamp because it could easily be counterfeit. Therefore, there is no way to tell if a transaction happened before another, and this opens up the potential for fraud.If this happens, there will be disagreement among the network nodes regarding the order of transactions each of them received. So the blockchain system has been designed to use node agreement to order transactions and prevent the fraud described above.The bitcoin network orders transactions by grouping them into blocks; each block contains a definite number of transactions and a link to the previous block. This is what puts one block after the other in time. Blocks are therefore organized into a time-related chain (Fig. 6) that gives the name to the whole system: blockchain.Fig. 6 \u2014 The block chain sequence structure simplifiedTransactions in the same block are considered to have happened at the same time, and transactions not yet in a block are considered unconfirmed. Each node can group transactions into a block and broadcast it to the network as a suggestion for which block should be next. Since any node can suggest a new block, how does the system agree on which block should be the next?To be added to the blockchain, each block must contain the answer to a complex mathematical problem created using an irreversible cryptographic hash function. The only way to solve such a mathematical problem is to guess random numbers that, combined with the previous block content, generate a defined result. It could take about a year for a typical computer to guess the right number and solve the mathematical problem. However, due to the large number of computers in the network that are guessing numbers, a block is solved on average every 10 minutes. The node that solves the mathematical problem acquires the right to place the next block on the chain and broadcast it to the network.And what if two nodes solve the problem at the same time and send their blocks to the network simultaneously? In this case, both blocks are broadcast and each node builds on the block that it received first. However, the blockchain system requires each node to build immediately on the longest blockchain available. So if there is ambiguity about which is the last block, as soon as the next block is solved, each node will adopt the longest chain as the only option.Fig.7 - End of chain ambiguity logicDue to the low probability of solving blocks simultaneously, it\u2019s almost impossible that multiple blocks would be solved at the same time over and over, building different \u201ctails,\u201d so the whole blockchain stabilizes quickly to one single string of blocks that every node agrees on.A disagreement about which block represents the end of the chain tail opens up the potential for fraud again. If a transaction happens to be in a block that belongs to a shorter tail (like block B in Fig. 7), once the next block is solved, this transaction, along with all others in its block, will go back to the unconfirmed transactions.Transactions in the Bitcoin blockchain system are protected by a mathematical race: Any attacker is competing against the whole network.Let\u2019s see how Mary could leverage this end-of-chain ambiguity to perform a double-spending attack. Mary sends money to John, John ships the product to Mary. Since nodes always adopt the longer tail as the confirmed transactions, if Mary could generate a longer tail that contains a reverse transaction with the same input references, John would be out of both his money and his product.Fig. 8 - Mary\u2019s double-spending attackHow does the system prevent this kind of fraud? Each block contains a reference to the previous block (see Fig. 6). That reference is part of the mathematical problem that needs to be solved in order to spread the following block to the network. So, it\u2019s extremely hard to pre-compute a series of blocks due to the high number of random guesses needed to solve a block and place it on the blockchain. Mary is in a race against the rest of the network to solve the math problem that allows her to place the next block on the chain. Even if she solves it before anyone else, it\u2019s very unlikely she could solve two, three, or more blocks in a row, since each time she is competing against the whole network.Could Mary use a super fast computer to generate enough random guesses to compete with the whole network in solving blocks? Yes, but even with a very, very fast computer, due to the large number of members in the network, it\u2019s highly unlikely Mary could solve several blocks in a row at the exact time needed to perform a double-spending attack.She would need control of 50 percent of the computing power of the whole network to have a 50 percent chance of solving a block before some other node does \u2014 and even in this case, she\u2019d only have a 25 percent chance of solving two blocks in a row. The more blocks to be solves in a row, the lower the probability of her success. Transactions in the bitcoin blockchain system are protected by a mathematical race: Any attacker is competing against the entire network.Therefore, transactions grow more secure with time. Those included in a block confirmed one hour ago, for example, are more secure than those in a block confirmed in the last 10 minutes. Since a block is added to the chain every 10 minutes on average, a transaction included in a block for the first time an hour ago has most likely been processed and is now irreversible.Fig. 9 - Blockchain transactions securityMining BitcoinIn order to send bitcoins, you need to reference an incoming transaction to your own wallet. This applies to every single transaction across the network. So, where do bitcoins come from in the first place?As a way to balance the deflationary nature of bitcoin due to software errors and wallet password loss, a reward is given to those who solve the mathematical problem of each block. The activity of running the bitcoin blockchain software in order to obtain these bitcoin rewards is called \u201cmining\u201d \u2014 and it\u2019s very much like mining gold.Rewards are the main incentive for private people to operate the nodes, thus providing the necessary computing power to process transactions and stabilize the blockchain network.Because it takes a long time for a typical computer to solve a block (about one year on average), nodes band together in groups that divide up the number of guesses to solve the next block. Working as a group speeds up the process of guessing the right number and getting the reward, which is then shared among group members. These groups are called mining pools.Some of these mining pools are very large, and represent more than 20 percent of the total network computing power. This has clear implications for network security, as seen in the double-spend attack example above. Even if one of these pools could potentially gain 50 percent of the network computing power, the further back along the chain a block goes, the more secure the transactions within it become.However, some of these mining pools with substantial computing power have decided to limit their members in order to safeguard overall network security.Since the overall network computing power is likely to increase over time due to technological innovation and the increasing number of nodes, the blockchain system recalibrates the mathematical difficulty of solving the next block to target 10 minutes on average for the entire network. This ensures the network\u2019s stability and overall security.Moreover, every four years the block reward is cut in half, so mining bitcoin (running the network) gets less interesting over time. To encourage nodes to keep operating, small reward fees can be attached to each transaction; these rewards are collected by the node that successfully includes such transactions in a block and solves its mathematical problem. Due to this mechanism, transactions associated with a higher reward are usually processed faster than those associated with a low reward. What this means is that, when sending a transaction, you can decide if you\u2019d like to process it faster (more expensive) or cheaper (takes more time). Transaction fees in the bitcoin network are currently very small compared with what banks charge, and they\u2019re not associated with the transaction amount.Blockchain Benefits and ChallengesNow that you have a general understanding of how the blockchain works, let\u2019s take a quick look at why it\u2019s so interesting.Using blockchain technology has remarkable benefits:You have complete control of the value you own; there is no third party that holds your value or can limit your access to it.The cost to perform a value transaction from and to anywhere on the planet is very low. This allows micropayments.Value can be transferred in a few minutes, and the transaction can be considered secure after a few hours, rather than days or weeks.Anyone at any time can verify every transaction made on the blockchain, resulting in full transparency.It\u2019s possible to leverage the blockchain technology to build decentralized applications that would be able to manage information and transfer value fast and securely.However, there are a few challenges that need to be addressed:Transactions can be sent and received anonymously. This preserves user privacy, but it also allows illegal activity on the network.Though many exchange platforms are emerging, and digital currencies are gaining popularity, it\u2019s still not easy to trade bitcoins for goods and services.Bitcoin, like many other cryptocurrencies, is very volatile: There aren\u2019t many bitcoins available in the market and the demand is changing rapidly. Bitcoin price is erratic, changing based on large events or announcements in the cryptocurrencies industry.Overall, the blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize several industries, from advertising to energy distribution. Its main power lies in its decentralized nature and ability to eliminate the need for trust.New use cases are arising all the time \u2014 like the possibility of creating a fully decentralized platform that runs smart contracts like Ethereum. But it\u2019s important to remember that the technology is still in its infancy. New tools are being developed every day to improve blockchain security while offering a broader range of features, tools, and services.Useful LinksGet your own Bitcoin walletBuy your first BitcoinsStart mining Bitcoin as a beginner or a proLearn more about decentralized applicationsMake sure your Bitcoins are kept safe, away from hackers, with a Ledger Wallet", "responses": 61, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Bitcoin", "Ethereum", "ICO", "Token"]}, {"title": "A blockchain in 200 lines of code", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@lhartikk/a-blockchain-in-200-lines-of-code-963cc1cc0e54?source=search_post", "author_name": "Lauri Hartikka", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@lhartikk", "publish_date": "2017-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2018-08-14", "readtime": "3.22", "claps": 17698, "voters": 3462, "content": "A blockchain in 200 lines of codeLauri HartikkaFollowMar 4, 2017 \u00b7 4 min readThe basic concept of blockchain is quite simple: a distributed database that maintains a continuously growing list of ordered records. However, it is easy to get mixed up as usually when we talk about blockchains we also talk about the problems we are trying to solve with them. This is the case in the popular blockchain-based projects such as Bitcoin and Ethereum . The term \u201cblockchain\u201d is usually strongly tied to concepts like transactions, smart contracts or cryptocurrencies.This makes understanding blockchains a necessarily harder task, than it must be. Especially source-code-wisely. Here I will go through a super-simple blockchain I implemented in 200 lines of Javascript called NaiveChain.Block structureThe first logical step is to decide the block structure. To keep things as simple as possible we include only the most necessary: index, timestamp, data, hash and previous hash.The hash of the previous block must be found in the block to preserve the chain integrityBlock hashThe block needs to be hashed to keep the integrity of the data. A SHA-256 is taken over the content of the block. It should be noted that this hash has nothing to do with \u201cmining\u201d, since there is no Proof Of Work problem to solve.Generating a blockTo generate a block we must know the hash of the previous block and create the rest of the required content (= index, hash, data and timestamp). Block data is something that is provided by the end-user.Storing the blocksA in-memory Javascript array is used to store the blockchain. The first block of the blockchain is always a so-called \u201cgenesis-block\u201d, which is hard coded.Validating the integrity of blocksAt any given time we must be able to validate if a block or a chain of blocks are valid in terms of integrity. This is true especially when we receive new blocks from other nodes and must decide whether to accept them or not.Choosing the longest chainThere should always be only one explicit set of blocks in the chain at a given time. In case of conflicts (e.g. two nodes both generate block number 72) we choose the chain that has the longest number of blocks.Communicating with other nodesAn essential part of a node is to share and sync the blockchain with other nodes. The following rules are used to keep the network in sync.When a node generates a new block, it broadcasts it to the networkWhen a node connects to a new peer it querys for the latest blockWhen a node encounters a block that has an index larger than the current known block, it either adds the block the its current chain or querys for the full blockchain.Some typical communication scenarios that follows when the nodes obey the described protocolNo automatic peer discovery is used. The location (=URLs) of peers must be manually added.Controlling the nodeThe user must be able to control the node in some way. This is done by setting up a HTTP server.As seen, the user is able to interact with the node in the following ways:List all blocksCreate a new block with a content given by the userList or add peersThe most straightforward way to control the node is e.g. with Curl:#get all blocks from the nodecurl http://localhost:3001/blocksArchitectureIt should be noted that the node actually exposes two web servers: One for the user to control the node (HTTP server) and one for the peer-to-peer communication between the nodes.(Websocket HTTP server)The main components of NaiveChainConlusionsThe NaiveChain was created for demonstration and learning purposes. Since it does not have a \u201cmining\u201d algorithm (PoS of PoW) it cannot used in a public network. It nonetheless implements the basic features for a functioning blockchain.You can check the Github repository for more technical details.If you want to understand more about blockchains, I suggest you to check out Naivecoin: a tutorial for building a cryptocurrency.

You can find the link to the follow up article at the end of this article.Everyone is talking about Bitcoin these days, from your barber to your friends working at stock market. Don\u2019t worry this article is not about several other articles talking about making money from Bitcoin. However, I will try to help you understand the underlying technology which makes Bitcoin work and how this concept of blockchain can be useful in the coming decades.Historical OverviewOctober 31, 2008, a white paper from an anonymous person or organization named Satoshi Nakamoto was published which explained a novel approach to send money from sender to receiver directly without involving any financial intermediaries. The paper gave a name to this concept \u2014 Bitcoin. Since, Bitcoin uses some underlying concepts of cryptography, this new way of exchanging money was categorized as cryptocurrency. The only purpose of Bitcoin was for financial transactions but researchers realized that its foundational technology can be harvested to build other secure and robust applications that can revolutionize the way current systems work. \u201cBlockchain\u201d was the name given to this foundational technology. Lots of technical words? Let\u2019s simplify!What is Blockchain? \u2014 A Real World AnalogyLet\u2019s imagine that you live in a city, which has a big parking space to park 200 cars at one time (assume that the parking space just has a ground floor). This parking space has a main gate which stays locked and is only opened when a car moves in or out. Now let\u2019s analyze this single parking building from different points of view \u2014Price: Since some private company built this parking space exclusively for parking purposes and all the maintenance cost will be beared by the owner company, there will be a high renting fee for renting out a single parking space.Security: If thieves get access to the main door, they can easily get to your car (take its wheels, or fuel, or damage the brake, anything!)Limit: What if the number of cars in your city grow from 200 to 300? The parking space will not have enough space for all cars and some other private agency will have to built a new parking space.Trusted: You trust the parking space company and they are responsible for taking care of security and reliability.Centralized: Since all the cars are in one building, we can consider it to be a centralized parking.Now, let\u2019s modify the current scenario. Imagine that there are 200 houses in your city and all 200 houses have two garages each. However, to simplify our explanation, let\u2019s assume each house just has one car (all cars filling up all the slots of big parking space described above). So, each house has one empty garage out of the two garages available. Now, let\u2019s say people of the city decide to rent out the extra garage to anyone who needs a parking. This model of providing parking space will solve the problem of parking 200 cars or more cars (in case people move in and out of the city) without the need of building any central bigger parking space for the entire city. Similar to the previous scenario, let\u2019s analyze this scenario \u2014Price: Since people didn\u2019t built the second garage exclusively for renting purposes and the cost of maintenance will be little, the cost to rent that extra space will be low comparatively to the big central parking spaceSecurity: Each car is locked in a different garage therefore thieves will have to unlock all the garages to get access to the cars, thus providing more security. (Security in blockchain is a bit different but for simplicity let\u2019s consider it this way for now!)Limit: As the number of houses grow, assuming each new house also has extra garage space, the space to keep more cars will keep increasing. Thus, increasing the network of lessee and lessor.Trustless: Since, no central authority controls these distributed parking spaces, we assume that there will be certain rules set by all the participating garage owners for renting out their places.Decentralized: As mentioned in the previous point, these parking spaces are distributed throughout the city, we can consider it to be a decentralized parking.The above analogy provides the foundation for understanding the actual technical infrastructure of the Blockchain.Parking Model to Technical ModelThe parking model presents a very basic overview of Blockchain in some real world language. Now, let\u2019s try to match the components of our parking example to the actual technical model \u2014The big central parking is a centralized system like AWS, Google Cloud etc. (these cloud platforms are also distributed at some level but for the sake of simplicity, we will assume them to be a single entity).The cars are the data and applications.The distributed parking is a decentralized system \u2014 Blockchain.Wait! We missed something.All decentralized systems are not Blockchain!! Yes, Blockchain is a particular type of decentralized system that has a unique property. Which property? Let\u2019s talk about it.\u201cBlocks\u201d make BlockchainLet\u2019s revisit our distributed parking example and make a small change. Let\u2019s assume that the lock to a particular garage is generated when a car is parked inside it (we assume that the same car goes to the same parking everyday). Also, assume that we have numbered all the distributed garages in serial order. The lock-key pair of garage #50 is based on the lock-key pair of garage #49 and also on the features (like color, weight, engine number etc.) of the car parked inside garage #50 and this process starts from garage #1 and moves till garage #200 or even more.Each garage\u2019s lock-key pair depends on the garage\u2019s car features and previous garage\u2019s lock-key pair.Therefore, if a thief tries to break into garage #49 and modifies any feature of the car, say its color or registration number, the features of car in garage #49 will change which means a new lock-key pair for garage #49 will be generated and since lock-key-pair for garage #50 depends on lock-key pair of garage #49, lock-key pair for garage #50 will also change and same goes on for future garages.Now, let\u2019s make one last assumption that computing a lock-key pair requires lots of computing resources which means if we have to recompute these pairs in case any thief modifies any car feature in any garage, it will be practically impossible to recompute all the pairs again.What happens if a lock-key pair is changed?Hope you remember that we talked about all garage owners abiding by some rules? One of these rules is to check for a valid garage. A garage is valid if you can validate its lock-key pair and if any lock-key pair gets changed, the lock-key pairs of all the following garages get invalid because every pair depends on the previous pair. (Process to validate a lock-key pair for a particular garage is very fast as compared to generating one).This dependence of one pair on the previous pair makes it a chain of garages and in technical world, these garages are \u201cblocks\u201d, thus getting its name \u2014 Blockchain (a chain of blocks).Blocks in Blockchain are tied to the next block by hashes just like lock-key pairs in our example. Similar to garage example, if data in one block is modified, hashes need to be recalculated for all the following blocks and since calculating the hash is a very resource intensive operation, it gets practically impossible to do that and hence the network rules out the invalidated block. The calculation of hash is called mining and we will talk more about it in the next release of this series.How do the blocks recover from modification?All the computers on the blockchain network, keep a copy of the full blockchain, so if one block or one complete chain at a particular computer or multiple computers is modified, the whole network tries to compare it with their own copies of the full chain.If majority of the nodes (or computers) on the network find that the modified chain is invalid, the modified chain is replaced with valid chain from other nodes. This makes Blockchain vulnerable to 51% attack. In simpler words, if more than 50% of the nodes on the network are malicious (or say have a modified chain), then the whole network can be compromised.ConclusionPhew!! that was a lot of information to digest. This was the part I of the full beginner\u2019s guide, providing the basic foundation for Blockchain. I hope this article prepared you for some good discussion with your friends regarding Blockchain.

While Satoshi converged a database structure with peer-to-peer networking, cryptographic tokenization, consensus formation algorithms, and game theoretical economic incentivization to create a means for trustless digital storage and transmission of value, the \u201cDigital Gold\u201d use case, is only one use case.Bitcoin as a digital store of value is the least interesting use of blockchain \u2026 There, I said it.Far more interesting are programmable money, programmable asset transfer, and shared, tamper-resistant business logic. People fixated on Bitcoin are missing the fact that we\u2019re verging upon the next generation of the world-wide-web.The Bitcoin protocol is the world\u2019s largest modern-day abacus; it only enables us to move a bead (or coin) from one side to the other. The ability to do this on a global, permissionless substrate is not trivial. But I can\u2019t overemphasize the limited scope of this initial design, due to its use of a virtual machine which isn\u2019t Turing-complete.Here\u2019s an example of a Bitcoin script:scriptPubKey: OP_DUP OP_HASH160 <pubKeyHash> OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIGscriptSig: <sig> <pubKey>The above script should serve to explain the inherent limitations of the Bitcoin scripting language. Ethereum can be thought of as Bitcoin + everything else, with a high level software language reminiscent of Javascript.While still being able to store and transmit value (the single Bitcoin use case), we\u2019re also able to program our agreements using Ethereum. Here are two examples of typical agreements that are now easily codified using Ethereum\u2019s Solidity programming language.A LoanAn Initial Public Offering or CrowdfundingOur agreements are turning from Microsoft Word documents written by attorneys and recognized by notaries into agreements bound by code, transacting assets that are natively digital.As the Internet commoditized the cost for communication, Ethereum commoditizes our costs of agreement and trust.2. 2018 in blockchain years is the equivalent of 1994 to the 1996 boom of the Internet.Intranets FirstSimilar to the evolution of the Internet that began on private Intranets, permissioned blockchains will give way to the permissionless blockchains once they successfully achieve scalability and privacy.The StackThe next generation of the internet will be a \u201cstack\u201d comprised of: (1) a decentralized transaction layer (the strongest of which I believe to be Ethereum); (2) a decentralized file storage layer (IPFS and Swarm are early leaders); (3) a decentralized messaging layer (Matrix or Whisper are strong candidates); and (4) a high throughput computing resource (Golem is an example of attempting to accomplish this).StandardsAs Jeremy Millar noted at the inception of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, blockchain technologies will be helped tremendously in 2018 through formal standardization processes similar to when Java evolved into Java 2 Enterprise Edition through standardization of database and web API\u2019s to be the most widely used software language on Earth.Consumer Facing ApplicationsEarly use cases of consumer facing Internet applications in the 90\u2019s were gambling, pornography, and games.Interestingly, we\u2019re seeing frontrunners on Ethereum in the same genres with Spankchain, Fun Fair, Virtue Poker, and Crypto Kitties consumer facing applications on Ethereum.3. Ethereum will continue to be the largest blockchain developer ecosystem in 2018 by many multiples.Developers, developers, developers, developers, developers\u2026 you get the point.The ecosystems with the most developers typically win. I don\u2019t see how permissioned blockchains that lack cryptoeconomic incentives will ever stand against public permissionless ecosystems.Ethereum already has a thriving developer community. Truffle, the smart contract developer framework, has 250,000+ developer downloads. Infura, which can be seen as an Akamai for Ethereum and IPFS, now handles over 2 billion requests per day and smoothly scaled to peak at 4.5 billion requests per day one day in December. MetaMask, which brings Ethereum seamlessly to browsers, has over 500,000 active users.4. Blockchain will be a vessel of good.As the world takes note of the societal implications of blockchain technology, we will see an uptick in humanitarian applications in 2018.In 2017 we saw the World Food Program employ Ethereum to distribute 1.4 million food vouchers to 10,500 Syrian refugees in Jordan. And it is aiming for one million transactions, per day. This innovative program, dubbed \u201cBuilding Blocks\u201d, demonstrates how database efficiency will deliver tangible benefits to the most vulnerable. I applaud the World Food Program\u2019s efforts and believe that its success is a sign of great things to come.5. Enterprises will take the training wheels off.As permissionless blockchains continue their scalability and privacy upgrade process, permissioned blockchains will continue to lose the developer mindshare and potentially lose their client base similar to how AOL, Prodigy, and Compuserve services lost out to the Internet. There will be narrow use-cases for intranet-like permissioned blockchains, just as SWIFT never touched the internet, but the long tail will be using permissionless protocols.Intranets were great training wheels, until the Internet was pervasive. The same trajectory will occur with permissioned blockchains in 2018 and beyond.6. Proof of Stake changes the blockchain consensus game.On New Years Eve \u201917, the Ethereum research team dropped the testnet alpha of Casper, named after the Greediest Heaviest Observed SubTree protocol. All eyes in the blockchain space will be watching the transition of Ethereum from proof of work to proof of stake.A proof-of-work consensus algorithm is an economic measure to deter denial of service attacks and other service abuses such as spam on a blockchain by requiring some work from the service requester, usually by processing complex equations on a GPU or ASIC computer.In proof-of-stake public blockchains, like Ethereum\u2019s upcoming Casper implementation, a set of validators each bet on blocks they deem likely to be validated, and the weight of each validators vote depends on the size of its deposit. Punishments are levied on bad actors who bet on more than one block at a certain depth or who don\u2019t participate when they are supposed to.Benefits of proof-of-stake include:The ability to reduce the large electricity consumption and hardware costs to secure a blockchain. It is estimated the Bitcoin electric consumption will trend toward equivalent consumption of the country of Denmark by 2020.Due to reduced energy consumption, token issuance isn\u2019t necessarily intrinsic to the securitization of the network. Negative net issuance could occur, whereby tokens are actually burned thereby reducing the supply and increasing value per token.51% attacks become exponentially more expensive, as you risk what you stake. Vlad Zamfir often explains that \u201cif you participate in a failed 51% attack, PoS will burn your ASIC farm down\u201d.7. Token Fever \u2014 Not so fast on the SAFT.As Earth continues to realize the advantages of natively digital assets for everything (natural resources, fiat, gold, music, loyalty points, Madonna concert tickets, software, real estate, IoT device registration, stocks, electrons, etc.) on global distributed ledgers, regulation will be necessary. Regulators will be empowered to create smart contract software specifications and develop tests that compliant companies must pass.With respect to the tokenization regulatory process, I\u2019m thankful to Marco Santori, Juan Batiz-Benet, and Jesse Clayburgh for taking the first crack at self-regulation through the SAFT whitepaper (hat-tip to Y-Combinator\u2019s SAFE), but I\u2019m not convinced that the well-intentioned SAFT is right for most tokenization projects.ConsenSys began the Brooklyn Project to embark on a journey of self-regulatory best practices and the bright legal minds of Cardozo Law and the ConsenSys legal team wrote an exquisite paper detailing the limitations of the SAFT.Token Foundry will be the first platform to allow regulatory compliant utility token launches without using a SAFT \u2014 meaning everyone (not just accredited people on Sand Hill Rd.) will be able to participate and purchase tokens in an initial sale, thereby continuing to democratize venture capital.I imagine the SAFT debate will continue to evolve into 2018 to further the best practices for tokenization. I look forward to seeing ConsenSys\u2019 tokenization best practices public unveiling in 2018.8. The blockchain ecosystem will ramp up their educational resources tremendously.\u201cEducation is the most powerful weapon you can use to change the world.\u201d \u2014 Nelson MandelaUntil recently, the ones learning have been software engineers, but in \u201918 there will be customized educational programs for policy makers, lawyers, project managers, executives, and MBA\u2019s to understand the implications this technology has on their respective fields. ConsenSys Academy has rolled out many of these endeavors already, and has some exciting initiatives coming in the new year.9. The IRS and their equivalents globally will be demanding their pound of flesh.\u201cNothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes.\u201d \u2014 Ben FranklinThere is already a precedent in US vs. Coinbase Inc., et al. where an exchange has had to divulge their user-base\u2019s trading history. I expect similar outreach to other exchanges. Software like Balanc3 is being used to track the p&l of a person or company\u2019s digital assets as well as trading history. Pay your taxes.10. People will take control of their online identities.We will continue to see the growing trend wherein people, companies, and machines manage their identity self-sovereignly rather then by a third party service provider like a bank, Facebook, or another internet service provider.Interestingly, governments will increasingly find themselves as attestors to these self-sovereign identities, similar to how Zug, Switzerland is attesting to citizens identity usage with uPort, Ethereum leading self-sovereign identity solution.11. In 2018, governments and regulatory bodies will mandate the use of blockchain to track and trace high value assets.\u201cThe supply chain stuff is really tricky\u201d \u2014 Elon MuskCompanies and organizations will realize that for the first time, it is possible to offload basic track and trace infrastructure to the public chain. This will lead to a decrease in cost and regulatory burden, and an increase in customer brand loyalty. These two trends will set the stage for a shared track and trace infrastructure supported by the public chain.Major Fortune 50 companies are already demanding public chain track and trace use cases for which they are using the Viant platform to build their solutions.12. The evolution of law will continue to intersect computer science.\u201cThe first thing we do, let\u2019s kill all the lawyers\u201d \u2014 ShakespeareThe lawyers of tomorrow will need to understand fundamental future aspects of computer science as much as legal precedent.Using OpenLaw, lawyers can create, deploy, and edit next-generation legal agreements relying on Ethereum and IPFS. Here are great examples of restricted stock grant purchase, standard agreement for equity, and an ERC20-token purchase agreement.Enterprise Ethereum Alliance has formed a working group with many of the leading law firms and legal schools to ensure the legal industry can adapt.13. \u201cFor the first time, open source, peer-to-peer protocol developers can monetize their project on a protocol level\u201d \u2014 Olaf Carlson-WeeFor the first time we\u2019ll be able to incentivize and monetize open source work, which will feel like adding a match to nitroglycerin in a Cambrian explosion of new blockchain technology paradigms. With new tokenized projects like Bounties.Network and Gitcoin, we\u2019re adding a cryptoeconomic layer to software engineering.14. BUGS begone: smart contract audits will be a necessity in 2018.For decades software engineers created code with bugs, which was somewhat inconsequential as software primarily served as a communication mechanism. As we transition to an Internet of Value with digitally tokenized assets, bugs can mean potential loss of capital. We don\u2019t need to re-dance the polka or revel in the DAO-Saster of 2017, and 2016 respectively to agree that smart contract security audits are necessary.Superstars like Phil Daian and ConsenSys Diligence will become the heroes of smart contract security audit and this could be one of the largest niches/job markets within the blockchain ecosystem.15. Don\u2019t just regulate blockchain\u2026.regulate THROUGH the blockchain.2018 will be the year of G-to-C and G-to-G (Government to Citizen and Government to Government) \u2014 laws, regulations, treaties written in smart contracts, making it 100x cheaper and more straightforward to comply with them and 100x cheaper and easier to do appropriate oversight without having to subpoena personal and company records.16. Stablecoins are coming.Stablecoins are the basis of financial instruments for hedging and derivatives that will be necessary for this wild-west industry to cross the chasm to safe and more easily used financial products. Maker DAO, VariabL, and Basecoin are attempting this from the startup eco-system, but I think this is a great space for an enterprise banking incumbent to provide value, liquidity, and validity to the digital asset ecosystem.I predict we\u2019ll see a bulge bracket bank blockchain-based stablecoin in 2018 if they can get it through compliance.17. Tangoing with Contango.After witnessing the first bitcoin futures products on regulated U.S. exchanges that are cash-settled in 2017, I foresee the market will evolve to physically settled offerings to avoid banging the close to manipulate futures. Moreover, we\u2019ll see other digital asset derivatives, such as ether.These derivative contracts will provide forward pricing curves that are necessary to the genesis and evolution of digital asset exchange traded funds.18. The total market cap of blockchain-based digital assets will exceed $2 trillion U.S. dollars by January 1, 2019.\u201cNew Car, Caviar, Four Star Daydream\u201d \u2014 Pink FloydThe price of ether will exceed $2,000 in 2018. Ether will continue to outperform bitcoin, and the total market cap of ether will exceed that of bitcoin in 2018. Bitcoin\u2019s governance issues, reluctance to evolve, and extremely high fees could lead it to its demise. Bitcoin Cash has a serious chance of eclipsing Bitcoin. The market cap of Filecoin will exceed that of bitcoin by 2023.There will be a crypto-winter, though not in \u201918, as the industry is in the spring of its youth.Interesting times,AK(@ConsenSysAndrew)Andrew is a co-founder of ConsenSys Capital, the financial services offering constellation at ConsenSys including ConsenSys Ventures, Token Foundry, and ConsenSys Capital Asset Management.

In the 5+ years I\u2019ve been working in the VC industry, this is by and large the fastest I\u2019ve seen any area of technology take off in terms of new company (or project) formation. It wasn\u2019t too long ago that founders and VCs were mainly focused on centralized exchanges, enterprise or private blockchain solutions, wallets, amongst several other popular blockchain startup ideas that dominated the market from 2012 to somewhere around 2016.However, as I wrote about a few months ago, the rise of Ethereum with its turing-complete scripting language and the ability for developers to include state in each block, has paved the way for smart contract development. This has led to an influx of teams building decentralized projects seeking to take advantage of the most valuable property of blockchains \u2014 the ability to reach a shared truth that everyone agrees on without intermediaries or a centralized authority.There are many exciting developments coming to market both in terms of improving existing blockchain functionality as well as the consumer\u2019s experience. However, given the rapid pace at which projects are coming to market, I\u2019ve found it to be difficult to keep track of each and every project and where each one fits into the ecosystem. Furthermore, it\u2019s easy to miss the forest for the trees without a comprehensive view of what the proverbial forest looks like. As a result, I have compiled a list of all of the decentralized blockchain-based projects that I have been following, was able to dig up through research, along with recommendations from friends in the ecosystem. This market landscape is the output of that work.A quick disclaimer: While it\u2019s difficult to pigeonhole a number of projects into one category, I did my best to pinpoint the main purpose or value proposition of each project and categorize them as such. There are certainly many projects that fall into the gray area and could fit into multiple categories. The hardest ones are the \u201cfat protocols\u201d which offer functionality in more than a couple of areas.Below is an overview of each broader category I\u2019ve identified, touching on some of the subcategories they\u2019re comprised of:CurrenciesFor the most part, these projects were created with the intention of building a better currency for various use cases and represent either a store of value, medium of exchange, or a unit of account. While Bitcoin was the first and is the most prominent project in the category, many of the other projects set out to improve upon a certain aspect of Bitcoin\u2019s protocol or tailor it towards a specific use case. The Privacy subcategory could probably fall into either the Payments or Base Layer Protocols categories, but I decided to break them out separately given how important anonymous, untraceable cryptocurrencies (especially Monero and ZCash) are for users who would like to conceal a transaction because they prefer not to broadcast a certain purchase for one reason or another, or for enterprises who don\u2019t want to reveal trade secrets.Developer ToolsProjects within this category are primarily used by developers as the building blocks for decentralized applications. In order to allow users to directly interact with protocols through application interfaces (for use cases other than financial ones), many of the current designs that lie here need to be proven out at scale. Protocol designs around scaling and interoperability are active areas of research that will be important parts of the Web3 development stack.In my opinion, this is one of the more interesting categories at the moment from both an intellectual curiosity and an investment standpoint. In order for many of the blockchain use cases we\u2019ve been promised to come to fruition such as fully decentralized autonomous organizations or a Facebook alternative where users have control of their own data, foundational, scalable infrastructure needs to grow and mature. Many of these projects aim at doing just that.Furthermore, these projects aren\u2019t in a \u201cwinner take all\u201d area in the same way that say a cryptocurrency might be as a store of value. For example, building a decentralized data marketplace could require a a number of Developer Tools subcategories such as Ethereum for smart contracts, Truebit for faster computation, NuCypher for proxy re-encryption, ZeppelinOS for security, and Mattereum for legal contract execution to ensure protection in the case of a dispute. Because these are protocols and not centralized data silos, they can talk to one another, and this interoperability enables new use cases to emerge through the sharing of data and functionality from multiple protocols in a single application. Preethi Kasireddy does a great job of explaining this dynamic here.FintechThis category is fairly straightforward. When you\u2019re interacting with a number of different protocols and applications (such as in the Developer Tools example above), many may have their own native cryptocurrency, and thus a number of new economies emerge. In any economy with multiple currencies, there\u2019s a need for tools for exchanging one unit of currency for another, facilitating lending, accepting investment, etc.The Decentralized Exchanges (DEX) subcategory could arguably have been categorized as Developer Tools. Many projects are already starting to integrate the 0x protocol and I anticipate this trend to continue in the near future. In a world with the potential for an exorbitant number of tokens, widespread adoption of applications using several tokens will only be possible if the complexity of using them is abstracted away \u2014 a benefit provided by decentralized exchanges.Both the Lending and Insurance subcategories benefit from economies of scale through risk aggregation. By opening up these markets and allowing people to now be priced in larger pools or on a differentiated, individual basis (depending on their risk profile), costs can decrease and therefore consumers should in theory win. Blockchains are both stateful and immutable so because previous interactions are stored on chain, users can be confident that the data that comprises their individual history hasn\u2019t been tampered with.SovereigntyAs the team at Blockstack describes in their white paper,Over the last decade, we\u2019ve seen a shift from desktop apps (that run locally) to cloud-based apps that store user data on remote servers. These centralized services are a prime target for hackers and frequently get hacked.Sovereignty is another area that I find most interesting at the moment. While blockchains still suffer from scalability and performance issues, the value provided by their trustless architecture can supersede performance issues when dealing with sensitive data; the safekeeping of which we\u2019re forced to rely on third parties for today. Through cryptoeconomics, users don\u2019t need to trust in any individual or organization but rather in the theory that humans will behave rationally when correctly incentivized.The projects in this category provide the functionality necessary for a world where users aren\u2019t forced to trust in any individual or organization but rather in the incentives implemented through cryptography and economics.Value ExchangeA key design of the Bitcoin protocol is the ability to have trust amongst several different parties, despite there being no relationship or trust between those parties outside of the blockchain. Transactions can be created and data shared by various parties in an immutable fashion. It\u2019s widely considered fact that people begin to organize into firms when the cost of coordinating production through a market is greater than within a firm individually. But what if people could organize into this proverbial \u201cfirm\u201d without having to trust one another? Through blockchains and cryptoeconomics, the time and complexity of developing trust is abstracted away, which allows a large number people to collaborate and share in the profits of such collaboration without a hierarchical structure of a traditional firm. Today, middlemen and rent seekers are a necessary evil in order to keep order, maintain safety, and enforce the rules of P2P marketplaces. But in many areas, these cryptoeconomic systems can replace that trust, and cutting out middlemen and their fees will allow users to exchange goods and services at a significantly lower cost.The projects in the subcategories can be broken down into two main groups: fungible and non-fungible. Markets that allow users to exchange goods and services that are fungible will commoditize things like storage, computation, internet connectivity, bandwidth, energy, etc. Companies that sell these products today compete on economies of scale which can only be displaced by better economies of scale. By opening up latent supply and allowing anyone to join the network (which will become easier through projects like 1Protocol) this no longer becomes a daunting task, once again collapsing margins towards zero.Non-fungible markets don\u2019t have the same benefits although they still allow providers to earn what their good or service is actually worth rather than what the middlemen thinks it\u2019s worth after they take their cut.Shared DataOne way to think about the shared data layer model is to look at the airline industry\u2019s Global Distribution Systems (GDS\u2019s). GDS\u2019s are a centralized data warehouse where all of the airlines push their inventory data in order to best coordinate all supply information, including routes and pricing. This allows aggregators like Kayak and other companies in the space to displace traditional travel agents by building a front end on top of these systems that users can transact on. Typically, markets that have been most attractive for intermediary aggregators are those in which there is a significant barrier to entry in competing directly, but whereby technological advances have created a catalyst for an intermediary to aggregate incumbents, related metadata, and consumer preferences (as was the case with GDS\u2019s).Through financial incentives provided by blockchain based projects, we\u2019re witnessing the single most impactful technological catalyst which will open up numerous markets, except the value no longer will accrue to the aggregator but rather to the individuals and companies that are providing the data.In 2015, Hunter Walk wrote that one of the biggest missed opportunities of the last decade was eBay\u2019s failure to open up their reputation system to third parties which would\u2019ve put them at the center of P2P commerce. I\u2019d even take this a step further and argue that eBay\u2019s single most valuable asset is reputation data which is built up over long periods of time, forcing user lock-in and granting eBay the power to levy high taxes on its users for the peace of mind that they are transacting with good actors. In shared data blockchain protocols, users can take these types of datasets with them as other applications hook into shared data protocols, reducing barriers to entry; increasing competition and as a result ultimately increasing the pace of innovation.The other way to think about shared data protocols can be best described using a centralized company, such as Premise Data, as an example. Premise Data deploys network contributors who collect data from 30+ countries on everything from specific food/beverage consumption to materials used in a specific geography. The company uses machine learning to extract insights and then sells these datasets to a range of customers. Rather than finding and hiring people to collect these datasets, a project could be started that allows anyone to collect and share this data, annotate the data, and build different models to extract insights from the data. Contributors could earn tokens which would increase in value as companies use the tokens to purchase the network\u2019s datasets and insights. In theory, the result would be more contributors and higher quality datasets as the market sets the going rate for information and compensates participants accordingly relative to their contribution.There are many similar possibilities as the \u201copen data platform\u201d has been a popular startup idea for a few years now with several companies finding great success with the model. The challenge I foresee will be in sales and business development. Most of these companies sell their dataset to larger organizations and it will be interesting to see how decentralized projects distribute theirs in the future. There are also opportunities that weren\u2019t previously possible or profitable as a standalone, private organization to pursue, given that the economics don\u2019t work for a private company.AuthenticityUltimately, cryptocurrencies are just digital assets native to a specific blockchain and projects in this category are using these digital assets to represent either real world goods (like fair tickets) or data. The immutability of public blockchains allows network participants to be confident in the fact that the data written to them hasn\u2019t been tampered with or changed in any way and that it will be available and accessible far into the future. Hence why, for sensitive data or markets for goods which have traditionally been rife with fraud, it would make sense to use a blockchain to assure the user of their integrity.TakeawaysWhile there\u2019s a lot of innovation happening across all of these categories, the projects just getting started that I\u2019m most excited about are enabling the web3 development stack by providing functionality that\u2019s necessary across different use cases, sovereignty through user access control of their data, as well as fungible value exchange. Given that beyond financial speculation we\u2019ve yet to see mainstream cryptocurrency use cases, infrastructure development and use cases that are vastly superior for users in either cost, privacy, and/or security in extremely delicate areas (such as identity, credit scoring, VPN\u2019s amongst others) seem to be the most likely candidates to capture significant value.Longer-term, I\u2018m excited about projects enabling entire ecosystems to benefit from shared data and the bootstrapping of networks (non-fungible value exchange). I\u2019m quite sure there are several other areas that I\u2019m not looking at correctly or haven\u2019t been dreamt up yet!As always if you\u2019re building something that fits these criterion or have any comments, questions or points of contention, I\u2019d love to hear from you.Thank you to Jesse Walden, Larry Sukernik, Brendan Bernstein, Kevin Kwok, Mike Dempsey, Julian Moncada, Jake Perlman-Garr, Angela Tran Kingyens and Mike Karnjanaprakorn for all your help on the market map and blog post.Disclaimer: Compound is an investor in Blockstack and two other projects mentioned in this post which have not yet been announced.", "responses": 141, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Crypto", "Cryptocurrency", "Tech", "Technology"]}, {"title": "Blockchain Governance: Programming Our Future", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@FEhrsam/blockchain-governance-programming-our-future-c3bfe30f2d74?source=search_post", "author_name": "Fred Ehrsam", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@FEhrsam", "publish_date": "2017-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2018-08-14", "readtime": "16.8", "claps": 21673, "voters": 2688, "content": "Blockchain Governance: Programming Our FutureFred EhrsamFollowNov 27, 2017 \u00b7 17 min readThis post describes why blockchain governance design is one of the most important problems out there, its critical components, current approaches, potential future approaches, and concludes with suggestions for the community.Why Blockchain Governance MattersAs with organisms, the most successful blockchains will be those that can best adapt to their environments. Assuming these systems need to evolve to survive, initial design is important, but over a long enough timeline, the mechanisms for change are most important.As a result, I believe governance is the most vital problem in the space. Other fundamental problems like scalability are arguably best approached by using governance to set the right incentives for people to solve them. Yet little research has gone into governance and it feels poorly understood.Evolutionary tree of life, from Leonard Eisenberg.Satoshi showed us the immense power of releasing a blockchain-based incentive structure into the world. A 9 page whitepaper spawned a $150bn cryptocurrency, a computer network bigger than the top 500 supercomputers by 10,000x, and a diverse ecosystem of developers, users, and companies. This was arguably one of the highest leverage actions in human history. It showed the power of blockchains as networks that can connect everyone and bootstrap themselves into existence if well constructed.We are increasingly living in digital networks, spending an average of 11 hours a day on screens in the US with over half of that on internet connected devices, growing 11% each year. However, these networks are highly centralized (Facebook, Google, Apple, Twitter) and continue to consolidate. In the current model, all of the profit and power of a network is within one company, and you\u2019re either inside or you\u2019re outside. It\u2019s important the networks we live in serve our best interests. With blockchains emerging as the new global infrastructure, we have the opportunity to create vastly different power structures and program the future we want for ourselves.For these reasons, I believe blockchain governance system design is one of the highest leverage activities known.A Cambrian ExplosionIt\u2019s rare a new government or central bank gets created, and even more rare to see experimentation with a new form of governance when it does.Blockchains are unique because they 1) allow thousands of governance systems and monetary policies to be tried at the speed of software with 2) in some cases, much lower consequences of failure. As a result, there will be a Cambrian explosion of economic and governance designs where many approaches will be tried in parallel at hyperspeed. To be clear, I am including economic design and monetary policy (said another way, incentive structure) in governance because, like other aspects of the system, they can be modified as time passes.Many of these attempts will be spectacular failures. With millions of algorithmic central banks we will have millions of crypto George Soroses trying to break the Bank of England. Through this process, blockchains may teach us more about governance in the next 10 years than we have learned from the \u201creal world\u201d in the last 100 years.Two Critical Components of Governance1. IncentivesEach group in the system has their own incentives. Those incentives are not always 100% aligned with all other groups in the system. Groups will propose changes over time which are advantageous for them. Organisms are biased towards their own survival. This commonly manifests in changes to the reward structure, monetary policy, or balances of power.2. Mechanisms for coordinationSince it\u2019s unlikely all groups have 100% incentive alignment at all times, the ability for each group to coordinate around their common incentives is critical for them to affect change. If one group can coordinate better than another it creates power imbalances in their favor.In practice, a major factor is how much coordination can be done on-chain vs. off-chain, where on-chain coordination makes coordinating easier. In some new blockchains, on-chain coordination allows the rules or even the ledger history itself to be changed.Current ApproachesWhat follows is a dissection of the benefits and drawbacks of today\u2019s two largest blockchains: Bitcoin and Ethereum. We are currently in the primordial ooze phase of blockchain governance. Systems are simple and little has been tried.BitcoinBitcoin was the first successful attempt to create a standalone blockchain. Let\u2019s examine it as a base:1. IncentivesDevelopers: increase value of existing token holdings, social recognition, maintain power for control over future direction.Miners: increase value of existing token holdings, expected future block rewards, and expected future transactions fees.Users: increase value of existing token holdings, increase functional utility (e.g. store of value, uncensorable transactions, file storage).2. Mechanisms for coordinationMostly off-chain. Developers coordinate through the Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) process and a mailing list. Miners can coordinate on-chain in the sense that they are creating the chain itself.Resulting systemThe checks and balances system created is somewhat analogous to the US government and has a number of benefits. Similar to the Senate submitting new bills, developers submit pull requests. Similar to the judiciary, miners decide whether or not to actually adopt the laws in practice. Similar to the executive branch, the nodes of the network can veto by not running a version which aligns with what the miners are running. And similar to citizens, the users can revolt. Finally, economic incentives dictate that it is in everyone\u2019s best interest to maintain trust in the system. For example: if miners alienated all the users, the tokens would decrease in value and they would go out of business. As the first system of its kind, it\u2019s incredible that Bitcoin is still going strong.Bitcoin as branches of US Government. Image from Buck Perley.There are risks to the system caused by asymmetries in incentives. Miners push for changes which increase future cumulative transaction fees, while developers don\u2019t care as long as the value of Bitcoin keeps going up. Developers\u2019 direct economic incentives are weak. New developers have little incentive to work on Bitcoin because there is no direct way to earn money by doing it. As a result, they often work on new projects \u2014 either by creating Ethereum tokens, entirely new chains, or companies. No new blood entering increases the perception and reality of early developers as the most knowledgable and experienced. This results in a self-reinforcing cycle of more power becoming concentrated in a small group of early core developers, slower technological advancement, and conservatism. Developers are at risk of being bribed since they have a lot of power but weak economic incentives. Some early holders and universities have sponsored developers, but with limited impact thus far.Similarly, asymmetries in ability to coordinate give miners disproportionate power. Communication amongst miners is easier because they are a small and concentrated group. Since mining is a business with economies of scale, we\u2019d expect a continued trend towards natural monopoly in mining and even greater coordination advantage. As a reference point, 95% of mining power was able to sit on one small stage 2 years ago. Miners can also gain disproportionate power by bribing developers or hiring their own. Finally, the checks and balances system of Bitcoin relies on some level of transparency: for example, users becoming aware of a single miner gaining more than 51% of the hashing power or developers having some level of independence. And a miner who was able to gain >51% of hashing power would be incented to remain anonymous. Rather than sparking a specific catastrophic event, this would cause an unknowing descent into a centralized world of control through censorship and asset freezing.EthereumThe systemic incentives and mechanisms of coordination in Ethereum are similar to Bitcoin at the moment.Dynamics will change as Ethereum moves to proof of stake. The power of miners will be replaced by anyone who holds a sufficient amount of Ether to run a virtual miner (a \u201cvalidator\u201d). This is especially true as solutions like 1protocol will allow even the smallest Ether holder to participate, flattening the distinction between a miner and a user, and potentially reducing the biggest centralization risk in Bitcoin.The incentives of core developers remain the same. Coordination around challenging issues has been swifter and smoother than in Bitcoin to date. This is due to 1) a culture more open to change because Ethereum was created as a reaction to what could not be done in a rigid Bitcoin environment and 2) direction from Vitalik who is widely trusted in the community.Current weaknesses in the model include 1) over reliance on its creator (Vitalik) and 2) like Bitcoin, limited ways to incentivize core development, forcing more projects to create tokens to support themselves. Vitalik is making a conscious effort to step back, which will be a delicate process.New Chains Experimenting with On-Chain GovernanceNew blockchains are making it much easier to coordinate by enabling on-chain governance.TezosIn Tezos, anyone can submit a change to the governance structure in the form of a code update. An on-chain vote occurs, and if passed, the update makes its way on to a test network. After a period of time on the test network, a confirmation vote occurs, at which point the change goes live on the main network. They call this concept a \u201cself-amending ledger\u201d.Such a system is interesting because it shifts power towards users and away from the more centralized group of developers and miners. On the developer side, anyone can submit a change, and most importantly, everyone has an economic incentive to do it. Contributions are rewarded by the community with newly minted tokens through inflation funding. This shifts from the current Bitcoin and Ethereum dynamics where a new developer has little incentive to evolve the protocol, thus power tends to concentrate amongst the existing developers, to one where everyone has equal earning power.This also enables users to directly coordinate on-chain, dramatically increasing their power and reducing the power of miners compared to a system like Bitcoin or Ethereum.DFINITYOne step further would be a system which allows on-chain votes to the rules of the system like Tezos and direct, retroactive changes to the ledger itself. In other words, if something happens that tokenholders do not like (ex: a hack, a marketplace selling drugs), they can roll back or edit the ledger in addition to the rules of governance themselves. DFINITY, an in-development blockchain, is taking this approach. Proponents of this system point to events like hard fork caused by The DAO hack and the recent $150m Parity multi-sig bug and suggest such events would be much smoother if everyone could just vote to undo them. On the flip side, this system allows direct censorship and peoples\u2019 tokens to be forcibly taken. As we saw with Ethereum\u2019s hard fork to revert The DAO hack, this is possible with existing blockchains, but requires higher friction through off-chain coordination and hard forking instead of on-chain coordination with no forking.DFINITY is maximally flexible. Depending on what parts of the protocol Tezos allows to be changed, it is possible protocol changes effectively let you re-write the ledger as in DFINITY. As a result, it\u2019s likely these systems will have different voting thresholds for different changes, perhaps requiring a supermajority for some things and a simple majority for others.The Double-Edged Sword of On-Chain GovernanceOn-chain governance is a double edged sword. On the upside it helps make sure a process is consistently followed which can increase coordination and fairness. It also allows for quicker decision making. On the downside it\u2019s risky because the metasystem becomes harder to change once instituted. Like anything put directly into code, it can be exploited or gamed more quickly and easily if flawed. Vlad Zamfir, a principal architect of Ethereum\u2019s proof of stake, feels \u201cthe risks far outweigh the rewards\u201d and \u201crepresent an extremely risky proposition\u201d.For some use cases, tending towards being static may be good. This may be especially true for store of value. Perhaps lower level protocols should lean toward stasis and conservatism \u2014 \u201cmeasure twice and cut once\u201d \u2014 while higher level protocols should be more flexible \u2014 \u201cmove fast and break things\u201d. In the words of Calvin Coolidge: \u201cit is much more important to kill bad bills than to pass good ones\u201d. Like established companies, some of the more established protocols may be able to watch what new protocols do and adopt techniques which seem to be working. This seems especially true of Ethereum which has shown a willingness to hard fork and the ability to maintain network value through them. Consequently, I\u2019d expect to see the most innovation in the next few years from Ethereum tokens and entirely new chains.It\u2019s probable we haven\u2019t found the best governance systems yet, which means a more general system which allows many different methods to be tried is valuable, if for nothing more than learning. A more complex system can simulate less complex ones, but the reverse is generally hard.The most interesting learnings will come from exploring the balance of mutability so systems can evolve and immutability for stability.Future ApproachesNext we\u2019ll talk about future governance strategies with potential which have yet to be tried.FutarchyIn futarchy, society defines its values and then prediction markets are used to decide what actions will maximize those values. Said another way: \u201cvote on values, bet on beliefs\u201d. It was originally proposed in 2000 by Robin Hanson, an economics professor at George Mason University.Ralph Merkle has a particularly eye-opening proposal for a blockchain implementation of futarchy in his paper called DAOs, Democracy, and Governance. In his proposal, every citizen is polled once a year and asked the question \u201chow satisfied were you this year on a scale of 0 to 1?\u201d. Averaged together, these give an overall societal welfare score. A prediction market on this welfare score is developed for every year for the next 100 years, where traders can speculate on the welfare score for any year into the future. An overall future welfare score is then created by averaging the scores for the next 100 years, weighting earlier years more than future years. When a new bill is introduced, there is a 1 week period where markets speculate on whether the overall welfare score will go up or down if the bill is passed. If the bill is passed, the traders who bet on the overall welfare going up now own the overall welfare contracts they bet on. They will make money if they are right and lose money if they are wrong.Example of futarchy for deciding whether or not to fire a CEO where the value to maximize is revenue. Image from ConsenSys.This system could be incredibly powerful for a few reasons. First, voting becomes extremely simple. People don\u2019t need to vote, they are just asked about one thing once a year: their satisfaction. Second, people do not need to develop extensive knowledge of candidates or bills. This is important because candidates are often persuasive and bills are complex to the point where it is hard for a domain-specific researcher to understand their implications, let alone an elected official or an average citizen. Instead, we rely on the wisdom of the markets. Like trading in stocks, only people who are extremely well informed on a topic will bet on it \u2014 otherwise they are likely to lose money to others who are better informed. Finally, it is a system where market incentives are aligned with societal values.In futarchy the devil is in the implementation details. Hard problems include the governance metaproblem of how to decide on the societal value(s) to maximize in the first place and making sure people aren\u2019t incented to tactically vote an extreme satisfaction score of 0 or 1 to swing policy.Setting goal functions is both important and tricky, as there are always unforeseen consequences. For example, in the case of capitalism, this can manifest in rising wealth inequality and environmental externalities. In the case of artificial intelligence, this can manifest in wireheading or rapidly maximizing something at the unexpected expense of other things, commonly illustrated through the example of a paperclip maximizer which destroys everything to build as many paperclips as possible. These are serious concerns, as I believe the most powerful AIs will be bootstrapped into existence on the blockchain by using tokenized incentives for everyone to feed them the best data and algorithms. If this is true, blockchain governance is the largest determinant of our future trajectory as a species. More on this in a future post.Liquid DemocracyLiquid democracy is system where everyone has the ability to vote themselves, to delegate their vote to someone else, and to remove the delegation of their vote at any time. In the U.S. we do not have a liquid democracy because we cannot vote on many bills directly (our representatives do that for us) and once we elect a representative, they are typically in office for 4 years.This seems like it will be used in proof of stake blockchains given its simplicity.Quadratic VotingQuadratic voting is a system of buying votes, where each additional vote costs twice as much as the one before it. In other words, money buys votes, but with strong diminishing returns. Vitalik proposed a variant on this he calls \u201cquadratic coin lock voting\u201d where N coins let you make N * k votes by locking up those coins for a time period of k\u00b2. This is a nice modification because it aligns incentives over time: more voting power requires living with your decisions for longer. In a tokenized world with little friction of entering or leaving a community, this is especially important.Voting with People or Money?A major problem with one person = one vote systems on the blockchain is their susceptibility to sybil attacks. Near zero cost to create infinite accounts means it\u2019s easy to generate infinite votes. This is why the default model in proof of stake and Ethereum-based token governance is one token = one vote.Blockchain-based identity systems like Civic can help enable one person = one vote systems. However, anonymity is likely to be preserved in most cryptocurrencies. Identity gives each coin its own unique history, which can be subjectively judged to be more or less clean than that of another coin, causing fungibility to break down. One potential approach is a balance between identity and money: a fully verified identity gets 100% of the voting power of their money, a partially verified identity gets 50%, and an entirely anonymous identity gets 25%.As mentioned in quadratic voting, other mechanisms which weight community members differently independent of real-world identity are likely to evolve. For example, a new token holder may have diminished voting power until they have been a member of the community for a while, similar to not being able to vote until you are a full citizen of a country.In any case, today\u2019s world would look a lot different if modern governments ran on voting with money, so this change in defaults is not to be taken lightly.Finally, reputation within a token community will be critical. This is already shown through indirect means, where Vitalik\u2019s suggestions carry a lot of weight in the Ethereum community. In a liquid democracy system reputation manifests in the number of votes delegated to a particular person. Someone with high reputation and no money could have 10 million Ether delegated to them and have tremendous governing power.Other ToolsSimple off-chain futures markets have already shown themselves as a powerful tool. In the recently proposed and contentious Bitcoin SegWit2x fork, futures markets speculated on the expected value of SegWit2x vs. non-SegWit2x chains. The markets consistently valued a SegWit2x chain at less than 20% of a non-SegWit2x chain for 3 weeks. Supporters of SegWit2x then called off their forking efforts because they felt they had \u201cnot built sufficient consensus\u201d. While it\u2019s hard to know exactly what caused them to reach this conclusion, it seems like futures markets were a strong indicator of lack of support.Futures markets on Bitcoin\u2019s SegWit2xOther tools are being built for governance and standardization at different layers. ZeppelinOS is a series of basic libraries which are commonly being used as the base of Ethereum token systems, covering things like token sale mechanics, token vesting, and access controls to the treasury of the project. Aragon is trying to create standard implementations of these systems in the same way Delaware C corporations implement corporations in a standard way.ForkingIt\u2019s worth noting that forking is always an option. Applying Albert Hirschman\u2019s classic voice or exit paradigm for affecting change in a system, voice is governance, weak exit is selling your coins, and strong exit is forking.We\u2019ve seen many examples of forking so far, and this is great! In physical nations forking is nearly impossible. This was also the case in software until blockchains emerged. They make it easy to take all the code and state of a system and try a new path. In the Web 2.0 world, forking is the equivalent of Facebook allowing any competitor to take their entire database and codebase to a competitor. Don\u2019t like how Facebook is operating it\u2019s newsfeed? Create a fork with all the same code, social connections, and photos.The ability to fork significantly reduces lock-in and increases diversity, allowing many more paths to be tried than we would ever see in modern governments, central banks, or Web 2.0 companies. As in corporate spinoffs, forking is also beneficial when two niche chains can more effectively serve distinct needs than one chain ineffectively serving both sets of needs.However, it is still valuable to avoid hard forks when possible. A hard fork is a non-backwards compatible change. Downsides of hard forks include:Reducing network effects. Not everyone is speaking the same language anymore.Creating work. Anyone who was using the forked protocol probably had their code broken. In a world that is increasingly interconnected through transparent and trustless code execution, these effects compound.Reducing trust. Now that we\u2019ve had a breaking change, those previously referencing the protocol must now go outside the blockchain and somehow figure out what the \u201cright\u201d new version is to use.Because of the dramatically reduced friction for exit, the need for effective voice (governance) is more critical than ever. It is trivial to fork a blockchain and copy all of its code and state. So the value isn\u2019t in the chain of data, it\u2019s in the community and social consensus around a chain. Governance is what keeps communities together and, in turn, gives a token value.Community SuggestionsFor users: Spend more time looking at the governance system of your blockchain, less time on the issue of the day. Current events are just a manifestation of the larger system that caused them. So while it\u2019s easy to get riled up by the news, the highest leverage point for change comes from designing or changing the system, not arguing about its current manifestations.For developers: Try inflation funding. And if you are creating a new token using a simple 1 token = 1 vote system, consider quadratic coin lock voting as a low risk/high return alternative.For everyone: Watch and learn from the experiments that will be run on the new on-chain governance systems.ConclusionLike organisms, the ability of a blockchain to succeed over time is based on its ability to evolve. This evolution will bring about many decisions on direction, and it is the governance around those decisions which most strongly determine the outcome of the system. If programming in the system is important, the metaprogramming of the system itself is most important.I believe governance should be the primary focus of investors in the space. The fundamentals of cryptoeconomics and overarching governance schemas of these networks are critical to survival, under-appreciated, and poorly understood. Investors can add significant value through the luxury of being able to observe and learn from multiple projects at one time. They should be active in the governance of the tokens they participate in and transparent with a community if they feel the design of the system can be improved.We are birthing into existence systems which transcend us. In the same way democracy and capitalism as systems determine so much of the emergent behavior around us, blockchains will do the same with even greater reach. These systems are organisms which take on lives of their own and are more concerned with perpetuating themselves than the individuals which comprise them. As technology stretches these systems to their limits, the implications become more pronounced. So we\u2019d be wise to carefully consider the structure of these systems while we can. Like any new powerful technology, blockchains are a tool that can go in many different directions. Used well, we can create a world with greater prosperity and freedom. Used poorly, we can create systems which lead us to places we didn\u2019t intend to go.Thanks to Vitalik Buterin, Buck Perley, Vlad Zamfir, Luke Duncan, Brian Armstrong, Ralph Merkle, Arthur Brietman, Julia Galef, Dominic Williams, Luis Iv\u00e1n Cuende, Matt Huang, Demian Brenier, Andy Coravos, Chris Burniske, Jim Posen, Balaji Srinivasan, Scott Nolan, Elad Gil, Chris Dixon, Maksim Stepanenko, Albert Wenger, Simon de la Rouviere, Sophia Cui, Lucas Ryan, Jay Graber, and Jeromy Johnson for conversations and ideas which contributed to this post.", "responses": 182, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Ethereum", "Bitcoin", "Tech", "Startup"]}, {"title": "The Blockchain Economy: A beginner\u2019s guide to institutional cryptoeconomics", "post_link": "https://medium.com/cryptoeconomics-australia/the-blockchain-economy-a-beginners-guide-to-institutional-cryptoeconomics-64bf2f2beec4?source=search_post", "author_name": "Cryptoeconomics", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@cryptoeconomics", "publish_date": "2017-09-27", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-21", "readtime": "13.1", "claps": 16567, "voters": 2470, "content": "The Blockchain Economy: A beginner\u2019s guide to institutional cryptoeconomicsCryptoeconomicsFollowSep 27, 2017 \u00b7 14 min readChris Berg, Sinclair Davidson and Jason Potts are from the RMIT Blockchain Innovation Hub, the world\u2019s first social science research centre into the economics, politics, sociology, and law of blockchain technology.The blockchain is a digital, decentralised, distributed ledger.Most explanations for the importance of the blockchain start with Bitcoin and the history of money. But money is just the first use case of the blockchain. And it is unlikely to be the most important.It might seem strange that a ledger \u2014 a dull and practical document associated mainly with accounting \u2014 would be described as a revolutionary technology. But the blockchain matters because ledgers matter.Ledgers all the way downLedgers are everywhere. Ledgers do more than just record accounting transactions. A ledger consists simply of data structured by rules. Any time we need a consensus about facts, we use a ledger. Ledgers record the facts underpinning the modern economy.Ledgers confirm ownership. Property title registers map who owns what and whether their land is subject to any caveats or encumbrances. Hernando de Soto has documented how the poor suffer when they own property that has not been confirmed in a ledger. The firm is a ledger, as a network of ownership, employment and production relationships with a single purpose. A club is a ledger, structuring who benefits and who does not.Ledgers confirm identity. Businesses have identities recorded on government ledgers to track their existence and their status under tax law. The register of Births Deaths and Marriages records the existence of individuals at key moments, and uses that information to confirm identities when those individuals are interacting with the world.Ledgers confirm status. Citizenship is a ledger, recording who has the rights and is subject to obligations due to national membership. The electoral roll is a ledger, allowing (and, in Australia, obliging) those who are on that roll a vote. Employment is a ledger, giving those employed a contractual claim on payment in return for work.Ledgers confirm authority. Ledgers identify who can validly sit in parliament, who can access what bank account, who can work with children, who can enter restricted areas.At their most fundamental level, ledgers map economic and social relationships.Agreement about the facts and when they change \u2014 that is, a consensus about what is in the ledger, and a trust that the ledger is accurate \u2014 is one of the fundamental bases of market capitalism.Ownership, possession, and ledgersLet\u2019s make a distinction here that is crucial but easy to miss: between ownership and possession.Take passports. Each country asserts the right to control who crosses its borders, and each country maintains a ledger of which of its citizens have the right to travel. A passport is a physical item \u2014 call it a token \u2014 that refers back to this ledger.In the pre-digital world, possession indicated ownership of that right. The Australian passport ledger consisted of index cards held in by the government of each state. Border agents presented with a passport could surmise that the traveller who held it was listed on a distant ledger as allowed to travel. Of course this left border control highly exposed to fraud.A Belgian passport held by the Australian National Archives, A435 1944/4/2579Possession implies ownership, but possession is not ownership. Now modern passports allow the authorities to confirm ownership directly. Their digital features allow airlines and immigration authorities to query the national passport database and determine that a passenger is free to travel.Passports are a relatively straightforward example of this distinction. But as Bitcoin has shown: money is a ledger, too.Possession of a banknote token indicates ownership. In the nineteenth century the possessor \u2014 \u2018bearer\u2019 \u2014 of a banknote had a right to draw on the issuing bank the value of the note. These banknotes were direct liabilities for the issuing bank, and were recorded on the banks\u2019 ledger. A regime of possession indicating ownership meant that banknotes were susceptible to be both stolen and forged.In our era fiat currencies a five dollar bill cannot be returned to the central bank for gold. But the relationship remains \u2014 the value of the bill is dependent on a social consensus about the stability of the currency and government that issued it. Banknotes are not wealth, as Zimbabweans and Yugoslavians and Weimar Republic Germans have unfortunately learned. A bill is a call on a relationship in a (now synthetic) ledger and if that relationship collapses, so does the value of the bill.The evolution of the ledgerFor all its importance, ledger technology has been mostly unchanged \u2026 until now.Ledgers appear at the dawn of written communication. Ledgers and writing developed simultaneously in the Ancient Near East to record production, trade, and debt. Clay tablets baked with cuneiform script detailed units of rations, taxes, workers and so forth. The first international \u2018community\u2019 was arranged through a structured network of alliances that functioned a lot like a distributed ledger.A fragment of a late Babylonian cuneiform ledger, held by the British Museum, 58278The first major change to ledgers appeared in the fourteenth century with the invention of double entry bookkeeping. By recording both debits and credits, double entry bookkeeping conserved data across multiple (distributed) ledgers, and allowed for the reconciliation of information between ledgers.The nineteenth century saw the next advance in ledger technology with the rise of large corporate firms and large bureaucracies. These centralised ledgers enabled dramatic increases in organisational size and scope, but relied entirely on trust in the centralised institutions.In the late twentieth century ledgers moved from analog to digital ledgers. For example, in the 1970s the Australian passport ledger was digitised and centralised. A database allows for more complex distribution, calculation, analysis and tracking. A database is computable and searchable.But a database still relies on trust; a digitised ledger is only as reliable as the organisation that maintains it (and the individuals they employ). It is this problem that the blockchain solves. The blockchain is a distributed ledgers that does not rely on a trusted central authority to maintain and validate the ledger.Blockchain and the economic institutions of capitalismThe economic structure of modern capitalism has evolved in order service these ledgers.Oliver Williamson, the 2009 Nobel laureate in economics, argued that people produce and exchange in markets, firms, or governments depending on the relative transactions costs of each institution. Williamson\u2019s transactions cost approach provides a key to understanding what institutions manage ledgers and why.Governments maintain ledgers of authority, privilege, responsibility and access. Governments are the trusted entity that keeps databases of citizenship and the right to travel, taxation obligations, social security entitlements, and property ownership. Where a ledger requires coercion in order to be enforced, the government is required.Firms also maintain ledgers: proprietary ledgers of employment and responsibility, of the ownership and deployment of physical and human capital, of suppliers and customers, of intellectual property and corporate privilege. A firm is often described as a \u2018nexus of contracts\u2019. But the value of the firm comes from the way that nexus is ordered and structured \u2014 the firm is in fact a ledger of contracts and capital.Firms and governments can use blockchains to make their work more efficient and reliable. Multinational firms and networks of firms need to reconcile transactions on a global basis and blockchains can allow them to do so near-instantaneously. Governments can use the immutability of the blockchain to guarantee that property titles and identity records are accurate and untampered. Well-designed permissioning rules on blockchain applications can give citizens and consumers more control over their data.But blockchains also compete against firms and governments. The blockchain is an institutional technology. It is a new way to maintain a ledger \u2014 that is, coordinate economic activity \u2014 distinct from firms and governments.The new economic institutions of capitalismBlockchains can be used by firms, but they can also replace firms. A ledger of contracts and capital can now be decentralised and distributed in a way they could not before. Ledgers of identity, permission, privilege and entitlement can be maintained and enforced without the need for government backing.Institutional cryptoeconomicsThis is what institutional cryptoeconomics studies: the institutional consequences of cryptographically secure and trustless ledgers.Classical and neoclassical economists understand the purpose of economics as studying the production and distribution of scarce resources, and the factors which underpinned that production and distribution.Institutional economics understands the economy as made of rules. Rules (like laws, languages, property rights, regulations, social norms, and ideologies) allow dispersed and opportunistic people to coordinate their activity together. Rules facilitate exchange \u2014 economic exchange but also social and political exchange as well.What has come to be called cryptoeconomics focuses on the economic principles and theory underpinning the blockchain and alternative blockchain implementations. It looks at game theory and incentive design as they relate to blockchain mechanism design.By contrast, institutional cryptoeconomics looks at the institutional economics of the blockchain and cryptoeconomy. Like its close cousin institutional economics, the economy is a system to coordinate exchange. But rather than looking at rules, institutional cryptoeconomics focuses on ledgers: data structured by rules.Institutional cryptoeconomics is interested in the rules that govern ledgers, the social, political, and economic institutions that have developed to service those ledgers, and how the invention of the blockchain changes the patterns of ledgers throughout society.The economic consequences of the blockchainInstitutional cryptoeconomics gives us the tools to understand what is happening in the blockchain revolution \u2014 and what we can\u2019t predict.Blockchains are an experimental technology. Where the blockchain can be used is an entrepreneurial question. Some ledgers will move onto the blockchain. Some entrepreneurs will try to move ledgers onto the blockchain and fail. Not everything is a blockchain use case. We probably haven\u2019t yet seen the blockchain killer app yet. Nor can we predict what the combination of ledgers, cryptography, peer to peer networking will throw up in the future.This process is going to be extremely disruptive. The global economy faces (what we expect will be) a lengthy period of uncertainty about how the facts that underpin it will be restructured, dismantled, and reorganised.The best uses of the blockchain have to be \u2018discovered\u2019. Then they have to be implemented in a real world political and economic system that has deep, established institutions that already service ledgers. That second part will not be cost free.Ledgers are so pervasive \u2014 and the possible applications of the blockchain so all-encompassing \u2014 that some of the most fundamental principles governing our society are up for grabs.Institutional creative destructionWe\u2019ve been through revolutions like this before.It is common to compare the invention of Bitcoin and the blockchain with the internet. The blockchain is Internet 2.0 \u2014 or Internet 4.0. The internet is a powerful tool that has revolutionised the way we interact and do business. But if anything the comparison undersells the blockchain. The internet has allowed us to communicate and exchange better \u2014 more quickly, more efficiently.But the blockchain allows us to exchange differently. A better metaphor for the blockchain is the invention of mechanical time.Before mechanical time, human activity was temporally regulated by nature: the crow of the rooster in the morning, the slow descent into darkness at night. As the economic historian Douglas W. Allen argues, the problem was variability: \u201cthere was simply too much variance in the measurement of time \u2026 to have a useful meaning in many daily activities\u201d.The 12th century Jayrun Water Clock\u201cThe effect of the reduction in the variance of time measurement was felt everywhere\u201d, Allen writes. Mechanical time opened up entirely new categories of economic organisation that had until then been not just impossible, but unimaginable. Mechanical time allowed trade and exchange to be synchronised across great distances. It allowed for production and transport to be coordinated. It allowed for the day to be structured, for work to be compensated according to the amount of time worked \u2014 and for workers to know that they were being compensated fairly. Both employers and employees could look at a standard, independent instrument to verify that a contract had been performed.Complete and incomplete smart contractsOliver Williamson and Ronald Coase (who was also an economics Nobel prize winner, in 1991) put contracts at the heart of economic and business organisation. Contracts are at the centre of institutional cryptoeconomics. It is here that blockchains have the most revolutionary implications.Smart contracts on the blockchain allows for contractual agreements to be automatically, autonomously, and securely executed. Smart contracts can eliminate an entire class of work that currently maintains, enforces and confirms that contracts are executed \u2014 accountants, auditors, lawyers, and indeed much of the legal system.But the smart contracts are limited by what can be specified in the algorithm. Economists have focused on the distinction between complete and incomplete contracts.A complete contract specifies what is to occur under every possible contingency. An incomplete contract allows the terms of the contract to be renegotiated in the case of unexpected events. Incomplete contracts provide one explanation for why some exchanges take place in firms, and why others take place in markets, and provides a further guide to questions surrounding vertical integration and the size of the firm.Complete contracts are impossible to execute, while incomplete contracts are expensive. The blockchain, though smart contracts, lowers the information costs and transactions costs associated with many incomplete contracts and so expands the scale and scope of economic activity that can be undertaken. It allows markets to operate where before only large firms could operate, and it allows business and markets to operate where before only government could operate.The precise details of how and when this will occur is a challenge and a problem for entrepreneurs to resolve. Currently, oracles provide a link between the algorithmic world of the blockchain and the real world, trusted entities that convert information into data that can be processed by a smart contract.The real gains to be made in the blockchain revolution, we suggest, are in developing better and more powerful oracles \u2014 converting incomplete contracts to contracts that are sufficiently complete to be written algorithmically and executed on the blockchain.The merchant revolution of the middle ages was made possible by the development of merchant courts \u2014 effectively trusted oracles \u2014 that allowed traders to enforce agreements privately. For blockchain, that revolution seems yet to come.Whither government?The blockchain economy puts pressure on government processes in a whole host of ways, from taxation, to regulation, to service delivery.Investigating these changes is an ongoing project of ours. But consider, for instance, how we regulate banks.Prudential controls have evolved to ensure the safety and soundness of financial institutions that interact with the public. Typically these controls (for example, liquidity and capital requirements) have been justified by the fact that depositors and shareholders are unable to observe the bank\u2019s ledger. The depositors and shareholders are unable to discipline the firm and its management.Bank runs occur when depositors discover (or simply imagine) that their bank might not be able to cover their deposits, and they rush to withdraw their money.The bank run in Mary Poppins (1964)One possible application of the blockchain would allow depositors and shareholders to continuously monitor the bank\u2019s reserves and lendings, substantially eliminating the information asymmetries between them and the bank management.In this world, market discipline would be possible. Public trust in the immutability of the blockchain would ensure no false bank runs occurred. The role of the regulator might be limited to certifying the blockchain was correctly and securely structured.A more far reaching application would be a cryptobank \u2014 an autonomous blockchain application that borrows short and lends long, perhaps matching borrowers with lenders directly. A cryptobank structured algorithmically by smart contracts would have the same transparency properties as the bank with a public blockchain ledger but with other features that might completely neglect the need for regulators. For example, a cryptobank could be self-liquidating. At the moment the cryptobank began trading while insolvent, the underlying assets would be automatically disbursed to shareholders and depositors.It is unclear what regulatory role government should have in this world.Tyler Cowen and Alex Tabarrok have argued that much government regulation appears to be designed to resolve asymmetric information problems \u2014 problems that, in a world of information ubiquity, often do not exist any more. Blockchain applications significantly increase this information ubiquity, and make that information more transparent, permanent, and accessible.Blockchains have their uses in what is being called \u2018regtech\u2019 \u2014 the application of technology to the traditional regulatory functions of auditing, compliance, and market surveillance. And we ought not to dismiss the possibility that there will be new economic problems that demand new consumer protections or market controls in the blockchain world.Nevertheless, the restructuring and recreation of basic economic forms like banks will put pressure not just on how regulation is enforced, but what the regulation should do.Whither Big Business?The implications for big business are likely to be just as profound. Business size is often driven by the need to cover the costs of business hierarchy \u2014 in turn due to incomplete contracts and technological necessity of large scale financial investment. That business model has meant that shareholder capitalism is the dominant form of business organisation. The ability to write more complete contracts on the blockchain means that entrepreneurs and innovators will be able to maintain ownership and control of their human capital and profit at the same time. The nexus between operating a successful business and access to financial capital has been weakening over time, but now might even be broken. The age of human capitalism is dawning.Entrepreneurs will be able to write a valuable app and release it into the \u201cwild\u201d ready to be employed by anyone and everyone who needs that functionality. The entrepreneur in turn simply observe micro-payments accumulating in their wallet. A designer could release their design into the \u201cwild\u201d and final consumers could download that design to their 3D printer and have the product almost immediately. This business model could see more (localised) manufacturing occur in Australia than at present.The ability of consumers to interact directly with producers or designers will limit the role that middlemen play in the economy. Logistics firms, however, will continue to prosper, but the advent of driverless transportation will see disruption to industry too.Bear in mind, any disruption of business will also disrupt the company tax base. It may become difficult for government to tax business at all \u2014 so we might see greater pressure on sales (consumption) taxes and even poll taxes.ConclusionThe blockchain and associated technological changes will massively disrupt current economic conditions. The industrial revolution ushered in a world where business models were predicated on hierarchy and financial capitalism. The blockchain revolution will see an economy dominated by human capitalism and greater individual autonomy.How that unfolds is unclear at present. Entrepreneurs and innovators will resolve uncertainty, as always, through a process of trial and error. No doubt great fortunes will be made and lost before we know exactly how this disruption will unfold.Our contribution is that we have a clear understanding of a model that can be deployed to provide clarity to the disruption as and when it occurs.", "responses": 66, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Cryptoeconomics", "Cryptocurrency", "Economics", "Institutions"]}, {"title": "Blockchains don\u2019t scale.

My excitement about the potential of blockchain technology has been building ever since.  Decentralized digital currency, once just a far-fetched goal, is finally making inroads into the mainstream. While that\u2019s exciting on its own merit, I\u2019m personally most excited about the potential for decentralized applications. Financial exchanges, prediction markets, and asset management platforms all carry enormous potential.  The trustless systems supporting them are no less intriguing; identity verification systems, smart property, censorship resistant social platforms, and autonomous structures and governance models like DAOs. The most disruptive use cases probably haven\u2019t even been dreamt up yet.  But this dream still remains a dream for the foreseeable future \u2014 while a few early enthusiasts and entrepreneurs are experimenting with building such applications, there\u2019s still a big missing piece that prevents us from seeing these applications come to fruition: scalability. Blockchains, as it stands today, are limited in their ability to scale.  That\u2019s not to say that this will be the case forever, but it\u2019s definitely true today. In fact, I\u2019d argue it\u2019s one of the biggest technological barriers we face with blockchain technology today. It\u2019s quickly become a very active area of research among researchers in the community and cryptocurrency in general.Why isn\u2019t the blockchain scalable?Currently, all blockchain consensus protocols (eg. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Tendermint) have a challenging limitation: every fully participating node in the network must process every transaction. Recall that blockchains have one inherent critical characteristic \u2014 \u201cdecentralization\u201d \u2014 which means that every single node on the network processes every transaction and maintains a copy of the entire state. While a decentralization consensus mechanism offers some critical benefits, such as fault tolerance, a strong guarantee of security, political neutrality, and authenticity, it comes at the cost of scalability. The number of transactions the blockchain can process can never exceed that of a single node that is participating in the network. In fact, the blockchain actually gets weaker as more nodes are added to its network because of the inter-node latency that logarithmically increases with every additional node. In a traditional database system, the solution to scalability is to add more servers (i.e. compute power) to handle the added transactions. In the decentralized blockchain world where every node needs to process and validate every transaction, it would require us to add more compute to every node for the network to get faster. Having no control over every public node in the network leaves us in a pickle. As a result, all public blockchain consensus protocols that operate in such a decentralized manner make the tradeoff between low transaction throughput and high degree of centralization. In other words, as the size of the blockchain grows, the requirements for storage, bandwidth, and compute power required by fully participating in the network increases. At some point, it becomes unwieldy enough that it\u2019s only feasible for a few nodes to process a block \u2014 leading to the risk of centralization. In order to scale, the blockchain protocol must figure out a mechanism to limit the number of participating nodes needed to validate each transaction, without losing the network\u2019s trust that each transaction is valid. It might sound simple in words, but is technologically very difficult. Why?Since every node is not allowed to validate every transaction, we somehow need nodes to have a statistical and economic means to ensure that other blocks (which they are not personally validating) are secure.There must be some way to guarantee data availability. In other words, even if a block looks valid from the perspective of a node not directly validating that block, making the data for that block unavailable leads to a situation where no other validator in the network can validate transactions or produce new blocks, and we end up stuck in the current state. (There are several reasons a node might go offline, including malicious attack and power loss.)Transactions need to be processed by different nodes in parallel in order to achieve scalability. However, transitioning state on the blockchain also has several non-parallelizable (serial) parts, so we\u2019re faced with some restrictions on how we can transition state on the blockchain while balancing both parallelizability and utility.Gimme the numbersSo what do the scalability numbers actually look like? Let\u2019s take a look. An Ethereum node\u2019s maximum theoretical transaction processing capacity is over 1,000 transactions per second [1]. Unfortunately, this is not the actual throughput due to Ethereum\u2019s \u201cgas limit\u201d, which is currently around 6.7 million gas on average for each block [2].Source: etherscan.ioQuick \u201cgas\u201d primer in case the measurement is new to you: in Ethereum, gas is a measure of computational effort, and each operation is assigned a fixed amount of gas (for example, getting the balance of an account costs 400 gas, creating a contract costs 32,000 gas, sending a transaction costs 21,000 gas, etc.). Transactions have a gas limit field to specify the maximum amount of gas the sender is willing to buy. Hence, the \u201cgas limit\u201d for each block determines how many transactions will fit in a block based on the gas limit specified by each transaction in the block.Ethereum\u2019s gas limit is somewhat similar to Bitcoin\u2019s 1 MB limit on the size of each block, with the difference being that Ethereum\u2019s gas limit is dynamically set by miners while Bitcoin\u2019s block size limit is hard-coded into the protocol.  This gas limit for Ethereum imposes a soft cap on the network\u2019s computational power per block: with the current 6.7 million gas limit and the current average gas used per standard transaction of approximately 21K, we get approximately 300 standard transactions every block. The current average block time is 20 seconds which equates to roughly 15 transactions per second (300 / 20 = 15) at best [4]. This gets much lower with more complex transactions (e.g. median gas used by smart contract calls is 50K [3], which means roughly ~7 transactions per second).Combined with the fact that the number of transactions on the Ethereum network is growing at a significant pace, you can see how this would become a problem. Daily transactions increased from approximately 40K to 240K from Q2 2016 to Q2 2017 [4], which represents a 500% year-over-year growth. Moreover, just in the past month it reached a peak of over 440K transactions per day! If we do some back of the envelope calculations, that\u2019s an average of 5 transactions per second.Uh oh.Similarly, Bitcoin, despite having a theoretical limit of 4,000 transactions per second, currently has a hard cap of about 7 transactions per second for small transactions and 3 per second for more complex transactions.Note that these limitations don\u2019t exist for private blockchains. Private blockchains can, in fact, achieve over 1,000 transactions per second on Ethereum or Bitcoin. Why? Because if you\u2019re running a private blockchain, you have the ability to ensure that every node on the network is a high-quality computer with high bandwidth internet connection. Scaling the blockchain currently would require us to add more compute to every node for the network to get faster. Since privately managed networks have control over every node in the network, they can do this. Moreover, since you\u2019re on a private network, you can handle some actions that would otherwise happen on the blockchain off the blockchain, such as making sure that each node that is participating is running a real node.I\u2019ve been architecting and implementing a new protocol on Ethereum, and have first-handly been confronted with future-proofing the issue of scalability. Personally, I\u2019ve been fascinated by the amount of research, discussion and most importantly, experimentation happening to solve this problem. In the rest of the post, I\u2019ll describe some of the proposed solutions being discussed in the community to solve scalability. Each comes with unique strengths and tradeoffs.The truth of the matter is that unfortunately, none of the solutions provide the silver bullet answer to scalability. In reality, each one of these solutions will help improve scalability incrementally. Combined together, there\u2019s a promising outlook for the future of blockchain scalability.Please note that the goal of this post is not to explore all the technical intricacies or to debate the merits of each proposed solution. Instead, my goal is to give you a 10,000 foot overview of some of the proposed solutions that I am aware of. If readers are interested, I can dive into some of the specific solutions in more depth in later posts. This post also assumes that you have a basic understanding of how the blockchain works. (If not, you can check out my last post \u201cBitcoin, Ethereum, Blockchain, Tokens, ICOs: Why should anyone care?\u201d for a refresher.)Let\u2019s dig in.SolutionsScaling the blockchain is a known challenge and has been an active area of research for several years. Specifically, if you\u2019ve been following the multi-year debacle in the Bitcoin community, you may have heard of two Bitcoin-specific scaling solutions known as SegWit and the 2 megabyte (MB) block size increase.Both of these solutions aim to solve the Bitcoin-specific issue where the Bitcoin-blockchain has a built-in hard limit of 1 megabyte (MB) per block, which caps the number of transactions that can be added to a block. As a result, Bitcoin has been facing delays (sometimes hours and even days) in processing and confirming transactions for a while now. Similarly, as we saw in the previous section, Ethereum also faces limitations in its ability to scale.Until we figure out how to scale the blockchain, we\u2019re limited to how fast and wide the use cases can actually grow. So let\u2019s take a look at some solutions on the table.Proposed solution #1: SegWit (Bitcoin-only)Every Bitcoin transaction contains:InputSender\u2019s previous transaction detailsSender\u2019s unique private key (i.e. `scriptSig`) which verifies that the sender has the right amount (based on their previous transactions) to make the transactionOutputAmount to sendRecipient\u2019s public address (i.e. `ScriptPubKey`)Out of these elements, the digital signature (`scriptSig`) is the largest in terms of size, accounting for ~60\u201370% of the transaction. Still, signatures are only needed at validation time.Segregated witness (also commonly known as Segwit) is solution to separate (i.e. \u201csegregate\u201d ) transaction signatures (i.e. \u201cwitnesses\u201d) from the rest of the transaction data. The signature is stripped off from within the input and moved to a structure towards the end of a transaction.Moreover, with SegWit, the witnesses are moved to a new \u201cwitness\u201d field in the transaction data, which allows for us to change the way block sizes are calculated. The block size limit is no longer measured in bytes. Instead, blocks and transactions are given a new metric called \u201cweight\u201d that correspond to the demand they place on node resources. Specifically, each byte of a segregated witness is given a weight of 1, each other byte in a block is given a weight of 4, and the maximum allowed weight of a block is 4 million, which allows a block containing SegWit transactions to hold more data than allowed by the current maximum block size. This would effectively increase the limit from 1 MB limit to a little under 4 MB, giving us a ~70% increase in transactions.SegWit also solves other issues besides scalability, such as transaction malleability and increased security (which I won\u2019t go into here since it\u2019s not related to scalability.)Proposed solution #2: 2 MB Block size (Bitcoin-only)While one side of the Bitcoin community (the users) strongly support SegWit, the other side of the community (the miners) prefers a hard fork that would change the 1 MB block size limit to 2 MB (Keep in mind that the 1 MB limit cannot be modified without a hard fork). The basic idea is simple: by increasing the block size, it would allow for more transactions to fit in each block, allowing the network to handle more transactions per second.Plans of this block size increase have long been a subject of heated debate in the Bitcoin community, and have gained increasing attention since the beginning of 2015, when the size of blocks started to approach the current hard limit of 1 MB.Proposed solution #3: Off-chain state channelsState channels are essentially a mechanism by which blockchain interactions that could and would normally occur on the blockchain instead get conducted off of the blockchain. This is done in a cryptographically secure way without increasing the risk of any participant, while providing significant improvements in cost and speed. I personally believe state channels will be a critical part of scaling blockchain technologies to support higher levels of use.  A state channel works as follows:Part of the blockchain state is locked via multi-signature or some sort of smart contract, where the only way to update it is if a specific set of participants agree completely.Participants make updates amongst themselves by constructing and cryptographically signing transactions without submitting it to the blockchain. Each new update overrides previous updates.At some later point, participants submit the state back to the blockchain, which closes the state channel and unlocks the state again.Steps 1 and 3 involve blockchain operations which are published to the network, pay fees and wait for confirmations. However, Step 2 does not involve the blockchain at all. It can contain an unlimited number of updates and can remain open indefinitely. In this sense, the blockchain is used purely as a settlement layer to process the final transaction of a series of interactions for the final settlement, which helps lifts the burden from the underlying blockchain.At any point during the process, any participant can send a transaction into the contract to close the channel and start a settlement procedure. This starts a time limit within which participants can submit transactions, and the transaction with the highest sequence number is processed. If one of the participants leaves or tries to cheat, another one can at any time publish the latest transaction to the blockchain to finalize the state, assuming all the participants completely agree on the state.Not only is transactional capacity increased with state channels, but they also provide two other very important benefits: increased speed and lower fees. Because a majority of the transactions are happening off-chain, payments can be handled instantaneously since updates between two parties that happen off-blockchain don\u2019t require the extra time to be processed and verified by the network. Secondly, payments also incur lower fees because only a small number of on-chain transactions are needed to secure the settlement state channels, while a majority of the transactions are happening off-chain without fees.There are several different implementations of this. For example, Lightning Network is a decentralized network that uses state channels via smart contracts to enable instant and scalable payments across a network of participants. Initially, Lightning Network was created for Bitcoin, but it seems now that they allow for transactions across blockchains as well.Raiden Network is the Ethereum analogy of the Lightning network. Raiden Network also leverages off-chain state networks to extend Ethereum with scalable and instant transactions.Proposed solution #4: ShardingSharding in the blockchain world is similar to database sharding in traditional software systems. With traditional databases, a shard is a horizontal partition of the data in a database, where each shard is stored on a separate database server instance. This helps spread the load across different servers.Similarly, with blockchain sharding, the overall state of the blockchain is separated into different shards, and each part of the state would be stored by different nodes in the network.A single shardTop level diagram of blockchain sharding [6]Transactions that occur on the network are directed to different nodes depending on which shards they affect. Each shard only processes a small part of the state and does so in parallel. In order to communicate between shards, there needs to be some message-passing mechanism.There are various ways to implement message-passing. In Ethereum\u2019s case, the approach they are taking is a \u201creceipt\u201d paradigm: when a transaction within a shard executes, it can change the state of its own local shard, while also generating \u201creceipts\u201d, which are stored in some sort of distributed shared memory that can later be viewed (but not modified) by other shards.Ethereum\u2019s receipt paradigm [1]Ethereum\u2019s receipt paradigm [6]Overall, sharding the blockchain requires us to create a network where every node only processes a small portion of all transactions, while still maintaining high security\u2026 A difficult challenge to say the least.Why?Well, for one, the blockchain protocol assumes that all nodes in the network don\u2019t trust each other. Still, the transactions need to agree on a common state despite being processed on different computers. Since each node does not trust one other, it is not enough for a node processing transactions on shard A to simply say to the nodes processing transactions on shard B that a transaction occurred; rather, it would need to prove it to them somehow.Additionally, since the goal of sharding is to not have every node validating every transaction, we need to figure out a mechanism that determines which nodes validate which shard in a secure way, without creating opportunities for an attacker who might have a lot of power in the system to disrupt the network.Another reason it\u2019s difficult to implement sharding is because a transaction executed on the blockchain can depend on any part of the previous state in the blockchain, which makes it challenging to do things in parallel. Moreover, with parallelization, you now need a fool proof way to mitigate with race conditions and the like.There\u2019s a lot more technical goodies to how sharding will be implemented in Ethereum \u2014 in particular, how to use \u201ccryptoeconomic incentives\u201d to drive actors in a system to not cheat (in this case, ensuring that nodes are passing on valid information to other nodes) \u2014 which I hope to explore in a future post.Proposed solution #5: PlasmaPlasma was very recently introduced and is among the more promising proposed solutions to scalable computation on the blockchain.Plasma is essentially a series of contracts that run on top of a root blockchain (i.e. the main Ethereum blockchain). The root blockchain enforces the validity of the state in the Plasma chains using something called \u201cfraud proofs\u201d. (Note: Fraud proofs are a mechanism by which nodes can determine if a block is invalid using mathematical proofs).Source: Plasma WhitepaperThe blockchains are composed into a tree hierarchy, and each branch is treated as a blockchain that has its own blockchain history and computations that are map-reducable. We call the child chains \u201cPlasma blockchains\u201d, each of which are a chain within a blockchain.Source: Plasma WhitepaperThe Plasma blockchain does not disclose the contents of the blockchain on the root chain (e.g. Ethereum). Instead, only the blockheader hashes are submitted on the root chain, which is enough to determine validity of the block. If there is proof of fraud submitted on the root chain, then the block is rolled back and the block creator is penalized. In other words, we only submit data to root chain in Byzantine conditions.As a result, the root blockchain processes only a tiny amount of commitments from child blockchains, which in turn decreases the amount of data passed onto the root blockchain and allows for a much larger number of computations.Source: Plasma WhitepaperIn addition, data is only propagated to those who wish to validate a particular state. This makes contract executions more scalable by eliminating the need for every node to watch every chain. Instead, they only watch the ones they are economically impacted by in order to enforce correct behavior and penalize fraud. Fraud proofs allows any party to enforce invalid blocks and ensure that all state transitions are validated.Additionally, if there is an attack on a particular chain, participants can rapidly and cheaply do a mass-exit from the corrupt child chain.Source: Plasma WhitepaperSource: Plasma WhitepaperPlasma might seem similar to state channels implementations (e.g. Lightning Network) that handle transactions off chain. The main difference between state channels and Plasma is that with Plasma, not all participants need to be online to update state. Moreover, the participants do not need to submit data to the root blockchain in order to participate and confirm transactions.The neat part about Plasma is that state channel type solutions like Lightning Network could be the main interface layer for rapid financial payments/contracts on top of Plasma, while Plasma maintains updates to the state with minimal root chain state commitments.Source: Plasma WhitepaperThere\u2019s a lot of intricate details to this solution that I hope to delve into a future post.Proposed solution #6: Off-chain computations (e.g. TrueBit)TrueBit is an example of a solution that uses off-chain computations to enable scalable transactions among Ethereum smart contracts. Essentially, just like state channels, TrueBit uses a layer outside the blockchain to do the heavy lifting. In other words, its a system that verifiably executes computations off-chain that would be otherwise prohibitively expensive to execute on-chain. It works like this:Instead of every node participating, specific participants in the network, called \u201cSolvers,\u201d perform the computations made by smart contracts and submit a solution to the problem, along with a deposit. If the Solver is correct, then the solver is rewarded and the deposit returned. Otherwise, if the Solver cheated, the deposit is forfeited and any dispute is resolved on the blockchain using the \u201cVerification Game\u201d.The Verification Games goes like this: You have a set of participants in the network called \u201cVerifiers\u201d who check the Solvers\u2019 work off the blockchain. If no Verifier signals an error, then the system accepts the solution. If a Verifier does dispute the correctness of the Solver\u2019s solution, the game proceeds in a series of rounds to settle the dispute on the blockchain, where \u201cJudges\u201d in the network with limited computational power adjudicate all disputes. The system is built to ensure that the work done by the Judges on the blockchain is small compared to the work required to perform the actual task off the blockchain.At the end of this game, if the Solver was in fact cheating, it will be discovered and punished. If not, then the Challenger will pay for the resources consumed by the false alarm.A very rough diagram of off-chain computations as proposed by TrueBitLastly, in order to convince Verifiers that bugs actually exist and that it\u2019s worth their effort to try to find those bugs, TrueBit does something interesting where it occasionally forces Solvers to submit incorrect solutions, which reverses the normal system incentives: the Solver gets paid for submitting an incorrect solution and penalized for submitting a correct one. This ensures there\u2019s always a reward in the system for Verifiers who are validating transactions.In summary, the protocol allows anyone to post a computational task, and anyone else to receive a reward for completing it, while the system\u2019s incentive structure guarantees the correctness of returned solutions. And by moving the computations and verification process off the Ethereum blockchain into a separate protocol, it can scale to large numbers of computations without being constrained by Ethereum\u2019s gas limit.Other proposed solutions to blockchain scalability.There are a few other proposals floating around the crypto community that I find interesting. While the solutions are not directly aimed at solving scalability, they help indirectly address some scalability problems more easily.Proof of stakeSimilar to Proof-of-work, Proof-of-Stake is a consensus mechanism which underpins security of the blockchain by preventing doublespend.In traditional Proof-of-Work based blockchains, miners maintain the integrity of the blockchain data by racing to solve computation-intensive, Proof-of-work mathematical puzzles in exchange for rewards. In this regard, they help validate transactions with their CPU power, and the more CPU power you have the proportionately larger your ability to influence the network is. In Proof-of-Stake, stakeholders vote with their \u201cdollars\u201d (in Ethereum\u2019s case, ether) instead of compute power.How does this work exactly?The blockchain keeps track of certain validating nodes, called \u201cvalidators\u201d, who must place a security deposit (which is referred to as \u201cbonding\u201d) in order to take part in validating the blocks. If a validator produces anything that the protocol considers \u201cinvalid\u201d in a crypto-graphically provable manner, their deposit AND the privilege of participating in the consensus process is forfeited. If they bet correctly, they earn their deposit back along with transaction fees.Effectively, the validators make money by betting with the eventual consensus and lose money by betting against the consensus. An analogy can be made to Proof-of-work where each miner is betting with their hash power on which block will be accepted. If they bet wrong in order to cheat the system, then any block they produce will be orphaned, causing them to lose money.There are several different kinds of Proof-of-stake consensus algorithms as well as different mechanisms for assigning rewards to validators, which I won\u2019t go into in this post.How does Proof-of-Stake help scalability?One example is with sharding. Sharding with Proof-of-work is tricky to do securely. Recall that with sharding, we split up the validation responsibility among many nodes so that every node doesn\u2019t have to process everything. However, Proof-of-work is implemented to be completely anonymous, which poses a problem because even if a single shard is secured by only a small portion of a miners hashpower, an attacker can direct all of their hashpower toward attacking this shard and disrupt the network. For example, let\u2019s say we have two shards, A and B. A has 90% of the hashpower and B has 10%. A can attack B with only 5.1% of the total hashpower (by virtue of the majority 51% attack).This changes with Ethereum\u2019s current Proof-of-Stake proposal because it is designed such that validators have known identities (i.e. Ethereum addresses). Knowing their identities allows us to solve this type of targeted attack by randomly choosing a set of nodes from the entire set of validators to process any given set of transactions on a shard, which makes it impossible for an attacker to specifically target any particular shard.Another reason Proof-of-stake helps scalability (specifically for Ethereum) is because unlike Proof-of-work which issues new tokens for miners who validate blocks, in Proof-of-Stake, validators will likely be earning only transaction fees. As a result, they have an incentive to increase the block \u201cgas limit\u201d (because it earns them more fee while also fitting more transactions in each block), if their validation server can handle the load. The caveat is that validators will only raise gas limit to a point that is tolerable by the other validators, because otherwise they get reduced returns from causing other, slower validators to fall out of sync.Blockchain rentAnother Ethereum-specific solution is \u201cBlockchain rent\u201d [5]. Blockchain rent is a solution that aims to reduce the amount of data that is stored on the network in order to help speed up transaction times. With Ethereum, users pay for computational steps, memory, transaction logs, and permanent storage. While most of these are resources are paid for in a properly incentivized manner, the claim here is that storage is not.In the current system, users only pay for bytes of storage. However, in reality, we can make the argument that storage is different from the other resources because it is stored forever permanently in the blocks. Instead, blockchain rent proposes to set the cost of storage to be `bytes x time`. This way, there\u2019s an incentive built into the protocol to keep the network lighter and reduce transaction times.Decentralized storageAnother solution for keeping the network lighter is using a decentralized storage service such as Swarm. Swarm is a peer-to-peer file sharing protocol for Ethereum that lets you store application code and data off the main blockchain in swarm nodes, which are connected to Ethereum blockchain, and later exchange this data on the blockchain .The basic premise here is that instead of nodes storing everything on the blockchain, they only store data that is more frequently requested locally and leave other data on the \u201ccloud\u201d via Swarm.A very rough diagram of decentralized storage using SwarmThere\u2019s more, but for the sake of brevity (this post is getting quite long!), I\u2019ll leave those out for now :)ConclusionThis topic is monstrously complex, but I hope this post was useful in giving you a big-picture idea of why scalability matters in blockchain, and how it might be solved.This is not be a comprehensive list of by any means, and I\u2019ll be following up on this topic as research progresses. I personally doubt that there\u2019ll be a single silver bullet answer to scalability\u2026 but I believe some combination of approaches will eventually solve the issue and allow blockchain applications to leap forward.As always, don\u2019t hesitate to correct any mistakes I\u2019ve made, or start a (healthy) discussion in the comments.

It\u2019s their earnings on their terms \u2014 true financial control that everyone deserves. And by automating the entire work to paycheck flow on the blockchain, we free employers from payroll processing time and costs.And, as you\u2019re about to find out, we\u2019re not just a whitepaper or a concept. We\u2019re a fully functioning platform.What Are the Problems with Today\u2019s Payroll that WorkChain.io Solves?WorkersAnyone who\u2019s ever received a paycheck knows the frustration of waiting two-to-four weeks for it to arrive. You do the work but don\u2019t see a dime for your efforts for weeks. All the while bills, rent, car payments and an assortment of other life expenses pile up. This outdated payroll cycle is a relic of the Industrial Age.Not only is getting paid bi-weekly or monthly completely out of touch with the on-demand, real-time way we work, it places major financial pressure on people. It strips them of financial control, leaving them unable to truly manage their finances, often leading to a cycle of debt.In fact, 78 percent of U.S. workers live paycheck to paycheck and 28% of workers are distracted at work due to financial stress.EmployersOn the other side of the payroll process, employers deal with labor-intensive, inefficient and costly payroll processing. Standard payroll comes with a heavy reliance on banks and third-party processors, leading to constant fees, administration and delays.Payroll is also extremely expensive too. In-house payroll costs on average between $722 and $1165 per employee per year. And outsourcing payroll to processors only cuts payrolls costs down by 27%.The Solution: How WorkChain.io Brings Payroll into Real-timeWorkChain.io uses blockchain technology to create a seamless system for automating payroll and delivering paychecks on-demand and in real-time with cryptocurrency payouts using a stable coin such as TrueUSD. It does this by connecting with established HR systems to verify an individual\u2019s work, shift or hours on the blockchain \u2014 then instantly releasing earnings connected with the work.WorkChain.io takes the manual work out of payroll by building verified work records on the blockchain, eliminating much of the administration and cost associated with processing payroll.How It Works1. An employee\u2019s hours, shift or attendance is verified through the WorkChain.io app.2. Each time they finish work, the earned funds become available for instant withdrawal.3. WorkChain.io pays workers what they\u2019ve earned in cryptocurrency.The WorkChain.io ProtocolOur proprietary protocol is what builds validated data and makes instant, real-time payroll possible.
