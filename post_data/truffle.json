Token crowd sales aka Initial Coin Offers(ICO) are hotter. There have been a lot going in terms of ICOs lately in the crypto world and if you would like to code one yourself, look no further. In this blog post I am going to go through the steps to create your own and only token as well as the ICO contract for it. We will also use the help of some clever tools.Caveat: You should not actually release your ICO with the code found here. It is for demo purposes only. But it is a good start.For this tutorial I am going to be using Truffle and Zeppelin Solidity. Truffle is the de facto framework for creating smart contracts and decentralized applications. Zeppelin Solidity is a library that has extensive and well tested smart contracts that adhere to security best practices. In the smart contract world where a small bug can cost you money, it is good not to reinvent the wheel when there are trusted solutions out there.We will also use ganache-cli as the blockchain node because it is fast and developer friendly.Side note: If you want to actually create the contract on the Ethereum testnet or main net you would have to use something like Geth or Parity.Moving on: provided that you have npm and node installed, from terminal type the commands:$ npm install -g ganache-cli$ npm install -g truffle$ mkdir my-ico && cd my-ico$ truffle init$ npm install openzeppelin-solidity@2.0.0A lot of magic happened with those commands above. But in essence it is the setup that will get you up and running with creating and deploying your ICO smart contract.This adds the openzeppelin-solidity folder to node_modules and in it you will find all smart contract templates from the OpenZeppelin Solidity library.First step is to create the token contract.touch contracts/GustavoCoin.solAnd for the code:How simple is that?!That is a straightforward token contract. We practically let Zeppelin Solidity smart contract templates do all the heavy duty for us. Here we reference MintableToken . The idea is to have a token where the supply is controlled by an owner who can emit tokens and assign them. For a better look at what this contract does, check it at node_modules/zeppelin-solidity/contracts/token/ERC20/MintableToken.sol .The following step is to create the Crowdsale contract.touch contracts/GustavoCoinCrowdsale.solWe are basically going to inherit the contract at node_modules/zeppelin-solidity/contracts/crowdsale/emission/MintedCrowdsale.sol and node_modules/zeppelin-solidity/contracts/crowdsale/validation/TimedCrowdsale.sol. We end up with only the code below.Beautiful, huh? We are using the secure contracts provided by Zeppelin Solidity to our advantage. Note that GustavoCoinCrowdsale inherits from TimedCrowdsale and MintedCrowdsale. In order to deploy GustavoCoinCrowdsale , we must give a few parameters to its constructor function as per the Crowdsale and TimeCrowdsale contracts, i.e. openingTime and closingTime timestamps, the rate of token per ether rate, the token address itself and the wallet address of the contract owner(s).Let\u2019s deploy this contract. Open a new terminal tab and run$ ganache-cliIt will run ganache-cli. We are using it for our development needs.First, let\u2019s add this to truffle.js file. It is for configuration purposes:truffle.js:module.exports = {    networks: {        development: {            host: \"localhost\",            port: 8545,            network_id: \"*\" // Match any network id        }    }};Then, go on (you may need to create it) to the file migrations/2_deploy_contracts.js and modify it to this:Note that we are not deploying GustavoCoin . This is because once GustavoCoinCrowdsale deploys it will create GustavoCoin . Now back to the terminal tab where you installed Truffle, run the commands:$ truffle compile$ truffle migrateIf you happen to look at the ganache-cli tab you will see that the contract was deployed successfully.Alright, let\u2019s buy some GUS tokens.Run $ truffle consoleThis will open truffle console and we are going to use the web3.js API to interact with the deployed contract.// The account that will buy GUS tokens. It will show differently in your ganache-cli console> purchaser = web3.eth.accounts[2]'0xddac5d057c79facd674bc95dfd9104076fd34d6b'// The address of the GUS token instance that was created when the crowdsale contract was deployed// assign the result of GustavoCoinCrowdsale.deployed() to the variable crowdsale> GustavoCoinCrowdsale.deployed().then(inst => { crowdsale = inst })undefined> crowdsale.token().then(addr => { tokenAddress = addr } )undefined> tokenAddress'0x87a784686ef69304ac0cb1fcb845e03c82f4ce16'> gustavoCoinInstance = GustavoCoin.at(tokenAddress)...// add minter role to crowdsale so it is able to mint tokens during crowdsale> gustavoCoinInstance.addMinter(crowdsale.address)...// now check the number of GUS tokens purchaser has. It should be 0> gustavoCoinInstance.balanceOf(purchaser).then(balance => balance.toString(10))'0'// Buying GUS tokens> GustavoCoinCrowdsale.deployed().then(inst => inst.sendTransaction({ from: purchaser, value: web3.toWei(5, \"ether\")})){ tx: '0x68aa48e1f0d0248835378caa1e5b2051be35a5ff1ded82878683e6072c0a0cfc',  receipt:   { transactionHash: '0x68aa48e1f0d0248835378caa1e5b2051be35a5ff1ded82878683e6072c0a0cfc',     transactionIndex: 0,     blockHash: '0xb48ceed99cf6ddd4f081a99474113c4c16ecf61f76625a6559f1686698ee7d57',     blockNumber: 5,     gasUsed: 68738,     cumulativeGasUsed: 68738,     contractAddress: null,     logs: [] },  logs: [] }undefined// Check the amount of GUS tokens for purchaser again. It should have some now.> gustavoCoinInstance.balanceOf(purchaser).then(balance => purchaserGusTokenBalance = balance.toString(10))'5000000000000000000000'// When we created our token we made it with 18 decimals, which the same as what ether has. That's a lot of zeros, let's display without the decimals:> web3.fromWei(purchaserGusTokenBalance, \"ether\")'5000'Yay! It worked.Where to go after here you ask?You could test this code on the Ethereum testnet, or you could create a web app that would allow users to interact with the CrowdsaleToken contract, you could add more functionality to the contract itself such as deadline, token cap, etc. Unleash your inner token creator.The Ethereum community grows by the day and though there are not many tools out there yet, the ones such as Truffle and Zeppelin Solidity do a great job at improving developer\u2019s experience.I am curious to know what you will be coding from here.By the way, here is the repo containing the code for this blog post.I want to leave my gratitude for Francisco Giordano for reviewing the code used in this blog post.", "responses": 72, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Truffle", "ICO", "Open Zeppelin", "Guide"]}, {"title": "Graal & Truffle", "post_link": "https://blog.plan99.net/graal-truffle-134d8f28fb69?source=search_post---------1", "author_name": "Mike Hearn", "author_link": "https://blog.plan99.net/@octskyward", "publish_date": "2016-07-12", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-17", "readtime": "12.5", "claps": 1070, "voters": 340, "content": "Graal & TruffleAn obscure research project could radically accelerate innovation in programming language designMike HearnFollowJul 12, 2016 \u00b7 13 min readSince the dawn of computing our industry has been engaged on a never ending quest to build the perfect language. This quest is difficult: creating a new programming language is a huge task. And too often the act of doing so fractures the programming ecosystem, leading to an endless grind in which basic tools are recreated again and again: compilers, debuggers, HTTP stacks, IDEs, libraries and an endless procession of other wheels are rebuilt for the hot new language of the day. Because perfection in language design is unobtainable and there are always new ideas to try, we are like Sisyphus: condemned by the gods to push boulders up the hill and watch them roll down again, over and over \u2026 for ever.How can the cycle be broken? Let\u2019s dream for a moment and imagine what it would take.We would want something, some kind of tool or technique, that gave us the following:A way to create a new language in just a few weeksThat ran as fast as the fastest other languages, automaticallyThat had high quality debugging support, automatically (ideally without any kind of slowdown)That had profiling support, automaticallyThat had a high quality garbage collector, automatically \u2026 but only if we wanted oneThat could use all the existing code that was out there, no matter what language it was written inThat supported any style of language, from low level C or FORTRAN to Java to Haskell to extremely dynamic scripting languages like Python and RubyAnd which could be either just-in-time or ahead-of-time compiledAnd heck, why not, that supports hotswap of code into a running programOh, and we\u2019d want this magic tool to be open source of course. And, er, it should come with a pony. I think that\u2019s it.Being a smart reader, you of course already guessed that I wouldn\u2019t be writing this article unless such a tool actually did exist. It goes by the bizarre name of Graal & Truffle. Despite sounding like it should be a pretentious hipster restaurant, it is actually a vast research project with over 40 computer scientists from across industry and academia. Together they are building a new set of compiler and virtual machine technologies that implements our wishlist above.By creating a way for anyone to quickly create a new language without the hassle of simultaneously creating libraries, optimising compilers, debuggers, profilers, bindings to C runtimes and all the other paraphernalia that a modern language is expected to have, it promises to unleash a new wave of language innovation that \u2014 I hope \u2014 could radically reshape the industry.And that\u2019s what this article is about.What are Graal & Truffle?Graal is a research compiler. Truffle is \u2026 well, that\u2019s kind of hard to explain, because there\u2019s not much to compare it to. The shortest summary I can think of is this: Truffle is a framework for implementing languages using nothing more than a simple abstract syntax tree interpreter.When creating a new language, the first thing you need is a grammar. The grammar is a description of the syntax rules of your language. By feeding the grammar to a tool like ANTLR you get a parser, and by feeding input text to the parser you get a parse tree:In the above image, the following piece of code has been turned into a tree representing its structure by ANTLR:Abishek AND (country = India OR City = BLR) LOGIN 404 | show name A parse tree, and a derivative construct called an abstract syntax tree (AST), is a natural way to express a program. Once you have a tree of objects representing nodes in a program, the next simplest step to getting your new language up and running is to add an \u201cexecute\u201d method to your node classes. Each node\u2019s execute method also invokes the child nodes and then combines the results to calculate the values of the expressions or perform the statements. And that\u2019s it!Interpreted dynamic languages like Python, JavaScript, PHP and Ruby look the way they do because building such a language is the path of least resistance when you start from a simple parse tree. If you\u2019re creating a language by yourself from scratch, adding complications like a static type system or an optimising compiler would slow you down a lot. The downside of doing things this way is that the result is very slow, and worse, it\u2019s very tempting to add features that are easy to implement in simple/slow AST interpreters, but extremely difficult to make fast.Truffle is a framework for writing interpreters with annotations and small bits of extra code in them which, when Truffle is paired with its sister project Graal, allow those interpreters to be converted into JIT compiling VMs \u2026 automatically. The resulting runtimes have peak performance competitive with the best hand-tuned language-specific compilers on the market. For example, the TruffleJS engine which implements JavaScript is competitive with V8 in benchmarks. The RubyTruffle engine is faster than all other Ruby implementations by far. The TruffleC engine is roughly competitive with GCC. There are Truffle implementations in various stages of completeness for:JavaScriptPython 3RubyLLVM bitcode, allowing C/C++/Objective-C/Swift programs to run on itAnother engine that interprets C source code directly instead of going via LLVM (this has some benefits described below)RSmalltalkLuaA variety of small experimental languagesTo give a feel for how easy it is to write these engines, TruffleJS is only about 80,000 lines of code compared to about 1.7 million for V8.Skip the boring bits, how do I play with it?Graal & Truffle are a product of Oracle Labs, the part of the Java team which does VM and compiler research. You can download a \u201cGraalVM\u201d here. It is an extended Java Development Kit that comes with several of the above languages built in, along with drop-in command line replacements for NodeJS, Ruby, and R. It also has something called \u201cSimpleLanguage\u201d which is a tutorial language used for teaching the framework.What does Graal do?If Truffle is a framework for writing AST interpreters, then Graal is the thing that makes them fast. Graal is a state of the art optimising compiler. It sports the following features:Can run either just-in-time or ahead-of-time.Extremely advanced optimisations, like partial escape analysis. Escape analysis is a way of eliminating heap allocations of objects when they aren\u2019t actually necessary. EA was made famous by the JVM, but it\u2019s complicated and very few VMs support it. The Turbofan compiler that Chrome uses for Javascript only started getting EA at the end of 2015. Graal features an even more advanced form of the optimisation that lets it work in more cases.Recognises interpreters written using Truffle and can convert Truffle ASTs into optimised native code, using a technique called partial evaluation. Partial evaluation of a self-specialising interpreter is called the first Futamura projection.Comes with an advanced visualiser tool that lets you explore the compiler\u2019s intermediate representation as it passes through optimisation stages.Written in Java, which means it\u2019s significantly easier to hack on and extend than a traditional compiler written in C or C++.Starting with Java 9, it can be used as a JVM plugin.The IGV visualiserGraal is designed from the start as a multi-language compiler, but its set of optimisation techniques is especially well suited to compiling programs with high levels of abstraction and dynamism. It runs Java as fast as the existing JVM compilers do, but when applied to Scala programs it runs them about 20% faster. Ruby programs get 400% faster than the best alternative runtime (i.e. not MRI).PolyglotThat\u2019s pretty neat by itself, but it\u2019s really just the beginning.Truffle provides a language interop framework called Polyglot that allows Truffle languages to call each other, and a thing called the Truffle Object Storage Model that standardises and optimises much of the behaviour of dynamically typed objects, allowing languages to share them too. And because Graal & Truffle are fundamentally built on top of the JVM, all these languages can also call in and out of JVM bytecode-based languages like Java, Scala and Kotlin too.The way Polyglot works is unusual. Because Truffle provides a standard framework for expressing nodes in an abstract syntax tree, calling into another language doesn\u2019t involve any complex hand-written binding layers. Instead, invoking a function simply joins the ASTs of the two languages together. Those two ASTs are then compiled and optimised by Graal as a single unit, meaning any complexity introduced by crossing the language barrier can be analysed and eliminated.It\u2019s for this reason that researchers decided to implement a C interpreter on top of Truffle. We normally think of C as being an inherently compiled language, but there\u2019s no particular reason it must be so, and in fact C interpreters have a long history of usage \u2014 for instance the Shake special effects app exposed one to its users as a way to script the app.Because scripting languages are so slow it\u2019s very common to rewrite performance hotspots in dynamically typed programs by hand in C, using the original interpreter\u2019s internal API to interact with the scripted code. Perversely, this technique actually makes it harder to speed up the language in general because running real programs often means running their C extensions too, and that\u2019s very difficult when those extensions make so many assumptions about the runtime\u2019s internals.When the people creating RubyTruffle hit this problem they came up with a clever solution: write a special C source code interpreter that not only understands ordinary C, but also macros and other constructs that are unique to Ruby extensions. Then by merging the Ruby and C interpreters together on top of the Truffle framework, the code will be blended together into a seamless whole and the interop overhead will be optimised away. This interpreter is called TruffleC.You can read an excellent explanation of how this works by Chris Seaton, one of the researchers behind the Truffle project, or you can read the research paper that describes it.Making C memory safeC programs are fast, but have a major downside: they\u2019re a hacker\u2019s playground because it\u2019s way too easy to shoot yourself in the foot by mismanaging memory somewhere.The ManagedC language is an extension of TruffleC that replaces C\u2019s standard memory management with checked, garbage collected allocation. ManagedC still supports pointer arithmetic and other low level constructs yet eliminates a large swathe of programming errors. It costs roughly 15% peak runtime performance vs GCC, and relies much more heavily on exploiting undefined behaviour than most C compilers do, meaning your program that works on GCC might not work on top of ManagedC, despite ManagedC complying with the C99 spec.You can learn more about this in the paper \u201cMemory safe execution of C on a Java VM\u201d.Debugging and profiling for freeA common problem people hit when implementing a new language is the lack of high quality tools. A good example of this is Golang, which has spent many years suffering from poor quality, primitive and often not-really-portable debuggers and profilers.Another common problem is that making a program debuggable means the running code must be very close to the source, to allow a mapping from the paused machine state back to the program the developer expects to see. This implies disabling compiler optimisations which can make debugging a painfully slow experience.Truffle provides a simple API that can be used from your AST interpreter that provides sophisticated debugging \u2026 without slowing down your program. All compiler optimisations still apply, yet the program state still appears as expected in the debugger. This is possible because Graal & Truffle generate metadata when your source is compiled to machine code, and that metadata can then be used to deoptimise parts of the running program back to its original interpreter state. When a breakpoint, watchpoint, profiling point or any other kind of instrumentation is requested, the VM forces the program back to the slow form, adds AST nodes that implement the requested functionality and then recompile it all back to native code, swapping the new code in on the fly.Of course a debugger requires more than just runtime support. A user interface for it is also rather helpful. There\u2019s a plugin for the NetBeans IDE which provides GUI support for debugging arbitrary Truffle languages.You can read more about this in the paper \u201cBuilding debuggers and other tools: we can have it all\u201d.LLVM supportMost Truffle runtimes interpret source code, but there\u2019s nothing that says you have to do that. The Sulong project is creating a Truffle interpreter for LLVM bitcode.Sulong is still very new and code run this way has many limitations. But by running bitcode with Graal & Truffle, the framework should in theory gain support for not only C, but also C++, Objective-C, FORTRAN, Swift and potentially even Rust.Code compiled with Sulong in mind has access to a simple C interop API that lets it call into other Truffle languages using Polyglot. Again, despite the language neutral and therefore completely dynamically-typed nature of this API, at runtime it will be compiled down to nearly optimal code via aggressive use of speculation to eliminate overheads on the common/fast paths.HotSwapHotswapping is the ability to redefine a programs code whilst it is executing, without a restart. This is one of the main productivity benefits of highly dynamic languages and although I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s been integrated yet, there is a research paper on adding hotswap support to the Truffle framework. Like with debugging, profiling and speed optimisations, language implementors have to use the new APIs to add support to their language, but doing so is significantly lower effort than coding all the needed runtime support themselves.What\u2019s the catch?As always in life, nothing is quite perfect. Graal & Truffle represent an almost complete wishlist of things you might want when implementing a new language from scratch, but they come with two big costs:Warmup timeMemory usageThe process of converting an interpreter into fully optimised native code relies heavily on learning how the code being executed actually works in practice. This is of course hardly new: the notion of the code \u201cwarming up\u201d i.e. getting faster as it runs is known to everyone who runs code on advanced VMs like HotSpot or V8. But Graal pushes speculative, profile-guided optimisation techniques far beyond the current state of the art and relies on profiling a whole lot more as a result.That\u2019s why the research team behind it invariably only quotes peak performance numbers: the speed of a program after it\u2019s been running for a while. This way of measuring performance doesn\u2019t measure how long it takes to reach that peak performance. In server side applications this is often not a big deal as it\u2019s the peak performance that matters the most, but for other kinds of program, long warmup times can be a deal killer. We can easily see this problem in action by simply running the Octane benchmarks included with the tech preview JDK: the scores are a bit lower than Chrome even though Graal gives itself long (15\u201360 second) warmup times \u2026 that it doesn\u2019t count towards its score.The second issue is memory usage. Programs that rely heavily on speculative optimisations require tables of metadata to be generated by the compiler, so the program can be de-optimised \u2014 mapped back from CPU state to the state of the abstract interpreter. This metadata is typically the same size as the compiled code itself, even after compression and optimisation of the data structures. In addition, the original ASTs or bytecodes must also be kept around so there\u2019s something to fall back to if the native code bails out due to relying on an invalid assumption. All this adds up to a significant extra source of RAM consumption.Compounding these problems is the fact that Graal, Truffle and the Truffle languages are themselves written in Java, meaning the compilers themselves need to warm up and become optimised. And as you go up the hierarchy of higher level languages, memory consumption of basic data structures tends to go up too, meaning the memory consumption of the base compiler infrastructure will also place additional load on the garbage collector.The people writing Graal & Truffle are not unaware of these problems, and have solutions in mind. One is called the SubstrateVM. This is a whole virtual machine implemented in Java which is designed to be compiled ahead-of-time to native code using Graal & Truffle\u2019s AOT mode. The SubstrateVM is much less advanced than HotSpot is: such a VM can\u2019t do tricks like dynamically loading code over the internet or hotswapping, and the garbage collector is also pretty basic. But by doing a full AOT compile of not only the VM but the source code to be run along with it, the entire thing can be optimised as a whole, and a significant source of warmup time can be eliminated.There\u2019s one final catch worth knowing about. I said at the start I wanted everything I listed to be open source. Graal & Truffle are huge and very expensive endeavours written by skilled people who don\u2019t come cheap. As a result, only some parts of what I\u2019ve described are fully open source.These bits are open and can be found on github or other repositories:Graal & Truffle themselves.The pluggable version of HotSpot they rely on.RubyTruffleSulong (LLVM bitcode support)The R, Python 3 and Lua implementations (some of these are hobby/research projects).And these things are not open source:TruffleC/ManagedCTruffleJS/NodeJS API supportSubstrateVMAOT supportTruffleJS can be downloaded for free as part of the GraalVM preview releases. I don\u2019t know how to play with TruffleC or ManagedC, although as Sulong implements some of their functionality, it may not matter much.Learn moreThe canonical full-blown, one-stop-shop tutorial on everything Graal & Truffle is this talk: \u201cOne VM to rule them all, one VM to bind them\u201d. It\u2019s three hours long, so be warned, it\u2019s only for the truly enthusiastic.There are a couple of tutorials on writing Truffle languages worth reading:A tutorial by Stefan MarrA tutorial by Cristian EsquivasWhat next?At the start I said that if we could eliminate the boulder-rolling associated with creating a new language it\u2019d open the door to a new wave of PL innovation. You can find a list of some initial experimental languages here, but I\u2019m hoping that there\u2019ll be many more in future.By trying out your new language ideas using Graal & Truffle you gain the possibility of your language being actually useful right from day one, and therefore growing a community of users and contributors who can deploy your language into their existing projects. It enables a virtuous cycle of feedback and improvement that could significantly accelerate the path from research to production.

Now, we will deploy it to two kinds of test networks.The tools we will useThe most prominent tools at the moments are:Truffle: A development environment, testing framework and asset pipeline for Ethereum. In other words, it helps you develop smart contracts, publish them, and test them, among other things. You can read the docs of the Truffle suite for more informations.Ganache: It was called TestRPC before, if you have read a tutorial from a few months ago, chances are they use TestRPC with Truffle, but it was renamed upon the integration of TestRPC within the Truffle Suite. What Ganache does is simple, it creates a virtual Ethereum blockchain, and it generates some fake accounts that we will use during development.Mist: It\u2019s a browser for decentralized web apps. It seeks to be the equivalent of Chrome or Firefox, but for Dapps. It\u2019s still insecure and you shouldn\u2019t use it with untrusted dapps as of yet.Ethereum wallet: It\u2019s a version of Mist, but only opens one single dapp, the Ethereum Wallet. Mist and Ethereum Wallet are just UI fronts. And we need a core that will connect us to an Ethereum blockchain(It could be the real Ethereum blockchain, or a test one).Geth: Is the core application on your computer that will connect you to a blockchain. It can also start a new one (in our case we will create a local test blockchain), create contract, mine ether etc.We will start by using Truffle and Ganache, and then use Truffle with geth and Mist.InstallationsThe requirements for this tutorial are that you know what is and how to use a command-line tool, and you are a bit familiar with NPM.TruffleOpen up a command-line, and type the next part:npm install -g truffleIf something goes wrong I advise you to read more on Truffle\u2019s docs.GanacheThen, install Ganache\u2019s command-line interface:npm install -g ganache-cliIf you are unsure about something, here is Ganache\u2019s Github page.N.B: There is a GUI for Ganache, but because we are such haxors, we will use the CLI.Let\u2019s startFirst, create a new folder, and type the next line:truffle initIt will initialize an empty truffle project.Then copy the Wrestling.sol file from the last tutorial, into the folder \u201ccontracts\u201d.Next, open the folder \u201cmigrations\u201d and create a new file named \u201c2_deploy_contracts.js\u201d. Migrations are simply scripts that\u2019ll help us deploy our contracts to a blockchain.Paste the following code inside, and save.The first line is there to import the \u201cWrestling.sol\u201d file from the \u201ccontracts\u201d folder, and the 4th line deploys it to the blockchain.Now, back to the root folder, you\u2019ll see two files, \u201ctruffle.js\u201d and \u201ctruffle-config.js\u201d. If you are on Windows, remove \u201ctruffle.js\u201d, if you are on another system, remove one of them, or keep them both, it\u2019s not important. The reason for that is, on Windows there is a naming problem, and when we will want to execute Truffle commands, it will open the config file \u201ctruffle.js\u201d instead of reading what\u2019s inside.I\u2019m writing this tutorial on Windows, so I\u2019ll remove the \u201ctruffle.js\u201d file. Then I\u2019ll put this code inside of \u201ctruffle-config.js\u201d:It basically says, that, when using the development network, connect to the host at \u201c127.0.0.1\u201d (localhost), using the port 7545.Now we are ready to test our code on a blockchain!Testing our codeIn the first part, we will use Ganache.Fire a new command-line and type in the following command:ganache-cli -p 7545What it does is, it tells ganache-cli to start at the port 7545.Ganache will generate test accounts for us, they have 100 ether by default, and are unlocked so we can send ether from them freely. The first account for example is the guy right here:Now, back to our first command-line interface, we execute two commands:truffle compiletruffle migrate --network developmentCompile will compile our Solidity code to bytecode (the code that the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) understands), in our case, Ganache emulates the EVM.Migrate will deploy the code to the blockchain, in our case, the blockchain could be found in the network \u201cdevelopment\u201d we set earlier in the \u201ctruffle-config.js\u201d file.Now, if everything has gone as expected, you should see this on your terminal:Notice that it shows the address of the instantiated Wrestling contract.On the commande-line interface where ganache-cli is run, you can see the transactions being executed:Notice that it shows the address of the instantiated Wrestling contract.Now type the following command to start Truffle\u2019s console. It will help us interact with ganache\u2019s blockchain.truffle console --network developmentFirst, we will execute this commands:account0 = web3.eth.accounts[0]account1 = web3.eth.accounts[1]It will assign the address of the first account to the variable account0, the second to the variable account1. Web3 is a JavaScript API that wraps RPC calls to help us interact with a blockchain in an easy way.Then we will write this:Wrestling.deployed().then(inst => { WrestlingInstance = inst })It assigns a reference to the instance of the contract that truffle deployed to the variable \u201cWrestlingInstance\u201d.Execute the the next line:WrestlingInstance.wrestler1.call()It will return the address of the wrestler1, in our case it was the first account. Truffle, during the migration, picked up the default account from Ganache, which is the first account, because we didn\u2019t specify another account address during the migration, or another address in the configuration file of Truffle.We will then register the second account as an opponent:WrestlingInstance.registerAsAnOpponent({from: account1})Here, the \u201cfrom\u201d directive tells the function from which account the transaction should be fired.Upon executing the line, it should return something similar to this:Notice that the transaction used Gas, and it fired the event \u201cWrestlingStartsEvent\u201d.You could retrieve the address of the second wrestler by executing the following line:WrestlingInstance.wrestler2.call()Now, the players can wrestle:WrestlingInstance.wrestle({from: account0, value: web3.toWei(2, \"ether\")})WrestlingInstance.wrestle({from: account1, value: web3.toWei(3, \"ether\")})// End of the first roundWrestlingInstance.wrestle({from: account0, value: web3.toWei(5, \"ether\")})WrestlingInstance.wrestle({from: account1, value: web3.toWei(20, \"ether\")})// End of the wrestlingThe \u201cvalue\u201d directive is used to send ether with a transaction. The \u201cweb3.toWei(5, \u201cether\u201d)\u201d part sends 5 ether, that value is converted to Wei. Wei is the base unit (lowest denomination) of ether. More infos could be found at this link.Upon executing the last line, the account1 will be the winner, since we put 23 ether in total with it, and it\u2019s more than the double of what we put with the account0.A little exercise for you is to withdraw the ether from the contract.Now, it\u2019s up to you to research how to use Truffle\u2019s and Ganache\u2019s advanced features. You can start by reading the docs, and alternatively, here is an excellent introduction to Truffle if you felt lost or want to reinforce your knowledge on what we just saw.How geth will fit in the pictureNow, if we used Ganache for development, we would want to use something closer to a real environment, if only just to be more familiar with it.InstallationsStart by downloading geth. On Windows, you might need to add geth\u2019s installation folder to your PATH variable.Download Mist or Ethereum Wallet. For our use, both will be alike, so it doesn\u2019t matter which one you pick.Onto the creation of the local private test networkIn the same root folder, create a new file, and name it \u201cgenesis.json\u201d. Then past the following content in it.The file \u201cgenesis.json\u201d is simply the configuration file that geth needs to create a new blockchain. It\u2019s not important to understand the content of the file for the moment.If you run geth without specifying any parameter, it will try to connect to the mainnet. The mainnet is the main network of Ethereum, the real blockchain of Ethereum.If you run Mist without specifiying any parameter, it will throw an error if an instance of geth is running. If you tell Mist to connect to the geth instance that is actually running(what we will do in a little moment) it\u2019ll work just fine. If you run Mist while no instance of geth is running, it will start a new instance of geth, and eventually ask you from which blockchain network it should download blocks.There is a public Ethereum test network, but we will create our own private test network locally, using the \u201cgenesis.json\u201d file we created earlier.Fire up another command-line interface and type in the following (be sure to run it in your project root folder):geth --datadir=./chaindata/ init ./genesis.jsonWe launch geth and specify where our blockchain will be stored, here in the \u201cchaindata\u201d folder (it will be automatically generated), and we initialize it with our \u201cgenesis.json\u201d configuration file.We then start geth using the following command:geth --datadir=./chaindata/ --rpcThe \u201c--rpc\u201d parameter tells geth to accept RPC connections, it\u2019s needed so that truffle can connect to geth.Open another command-line interface, and start Mist (or Ethereum Wallet), using the same parameters:mist \u2013rpc http://127.0.0.1:8545The \u201c-rpc\u201d tells Mist (or Ethereum Wallet) to connect to the instance of geth we started.In the Wallets tab, press Add Account and create a new wallet:Notice that we are using a private network. Beware of that, you wouldn\u2019t want to use you ether on the Mainnet for development purposes.I will create an account using the password \u201c123456789\u201d. In a real environment, use a stronger password.Open up a new command-line interface and run this command:geth attachIt will run the console of geth, and we can now interact with it.With out main account created on the Mist UI, we will run this command inside of \u201cgeth attach\u201d console:miner.start()It will start a miner, the process that will confirm transactions, and after a few seconds or minutes (depending or your computer), you should start seeing ether being added to your balance (And also to your main account):Note that if you don\u2019t have enough RAM available, it may not start mining at all. You can stop the mining using the command \u201cminer.stop()\u201d.Now, open the \u201ctruffle-config.js\u201d file again, and modify it like this:The \u201courTestNet\u201d is the configuration necessary to connect to the geth instance. Geth starts by default on port 8545.In the command-line interface where we launched \u201cgeth attach\u201d, we will unlock the account, so we can use it to migrate the Smart Contract from Truffle, using the following command:personal.unlockAccount('0x6AC4660c960Aaf5d9E86403DDAcB4791767e5869', '123456789')Here, I used the address of the account I just created, it would be a different address for you, and the password \u201c123456789\u201d that I\u2019ll use for these tests. Notice that the password is shown in plain text, and you should use a different method with a real account.Now, back to the command-line interface where we previously launched Truffle, run this command:truffle migrate --network ourTestNetIt will start migrating the contract to the blockchain that geth is running. Start the miner if you previously stopped it, otherwise, the migration will not be executed.If the migration was successful, you would see an output like this:Now, run the following command to start Truffle\u2019s console:truffle console --network ourTestNetThen run these two commands:Wrestling.addressJSON.stringify(Wrestling.abi)You should have an output like this:The first line returns the address of the deployed Wresting contract instance.The second line, will return the Wresting contract ABI. The ABI is basically a description of the contract. It contains a list of its functions and variables among other things.When copying the address and the ABI, remove the apostrophes highlighted by a red arrow in the screenshot.Now, back to Mist, we will open the contracts tab, and click on watch contract.Then we will past the address and the ABI of the Wrestling contract we deployed:Click on \u201cOK\u201d, then it will be shown in your watched contracts list. Click on it and it will open the contract page. If you scroll down, you\u2019ll see something like this:Use the select a function part to interact with the contract. It\u2019s the same as we did above using Truffle\u2019s console.And that\u2019s it, we saw how Ganache and geth come in play. When you will want to deploy a contract to the real blockchain, you should use the second method and connect geth with the mainnet.N.B: You could deploy a contract directly on Mist without using Truffle migration system, here is an example video of that process. Using Truffle is more interesting in a real development process though, since you\u2019ll be able to include and import multiple other smart contracts and scripts if you use a modular approach to develop your smart contracts.N.B.2: You could always write your contract code on a basic nodepad application, and deploy it to the mainnet using some trusted third party\u2019s portal, but I advise you to not.The repository for this tutorial can be found here:devzl/ethereum-walkthrough-2ethereum-walkthrough-2 - Repository for the second part of the tutorial series on Ethereum, \"Ethereum development\u2026github.comIn conclusionWe have seen 4 ways of developing and deploying our Smart Contracts:The first one is to use Truffle and Ganache. Since we copied the code from the last tutorial, I want to tell you that there are plugins available for the most popular text editors and IDEs. Some offer only syntax highlighting, while others help with other areas.The second one is to deploy code from Truffle to geth (and the GUI app Mist).The third, is to use Remix to write small, simple contract when you are just learning Solidity, and deploying the code in Mist like shown in the video previously linked.Or like a real cowboy, you could use a simple text editor to write and then deploy your untested contract using a nameless third party\u2019s drag-and-drop deployment feature.In the next part, we will discuss security since our \u201cWrestling\u201d script is far from being ready to be launched in a real environment.After, that we will see Token creation, and Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs).If you liked this second part, you can find me on twitter @dev_zl.", "responses": 40, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Blockchain", "Tutorial", "Development", "Solidity"]}, {"title": "Developing Ethereum Dapps with Truffle and MetaMask", "post_link": "https://medium.com/metamask/developing-ethereum-dapps-with-truffle-and-metamask-aa8ad7e363ba?source=search_post---------3", "author_name": "Dan Finlay", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@danfinlay", "publish_date": "2016-11-18", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-19", "readtime": "6.83", "claps": 675, "voters": 169, "content": "Developing Ethereum Dapps with Truffle and MetaMaskDan FinlayFollowNov 18, 2016 \u00b7 7 min readFeb 4, 2017 Update: A new version of Truffle has been released, Version 3, and is not yet reflected in this tutorial! To get the latest word on that migration process, check out the Truffle 3 migration guide. We will eventually update this tutorial for Truffle 3, but until then, if you just want to get your feet wet, maybe try this tutorial out with Truffle 2.0. npm install -g truffle@2. You might also find Truffle 3 to be easy to start with Webpack using this video tutorial.If you\u2019re interested in building web apps with the Ethereum blockchain, you may have found the Truffle web framework to be a nice fit for your needs.For many types of Dapps (Distributed Apps), Truffle does everything you could want: It compiles your blockchain contracts, injects them into your web app, and can even run a test suite against them!This is all great for you, but what about your users? Truffle has some great defaults for users who are willing to run a local Ethereum JSON RPC server on their computer, but what about your users who just want to sign on and get started?With Metamask, all your users need to do is install our Chrome plugin, and they will have their own secure blockchain accounts right there in the convenience of their browsers.Metamask is just a Developer Preview right now, and has not been released to the general public. We don\u2019t recommend putting serious funds in it, but instead encourage you to use it to help prepare your dapps for Ethereum browsers.It\u2019s possible your Truffle Dapp is already compatible with Metamask, but if you\u2019re like me, you want to go through your project and see what it\u2019s like from your user\u2019s perspective.Just in case you haven\u2019t used Truffle before, I\u2019m going to start by describing how to scaffold a minimal Truffle dapp. If you already have one set up, feel free to jump ahead to Setting up Metamask.Installing Truffle DependenciesYou\u2019re going to need to have installed node.js.From there, you need to install truffle (npm install -g truffle).Also, you\u2019re going to need to run a local blockchain RPC server to test and develop against. I recommend using testrpc, which you install by running npm install -g ethereumjs-testrpc.Next let\u2019s make sure we have our testrpc running in the background. Open your terminal and run the command testrpc. That's all! It runs on port 8545by default, just like most Ethereum RPCs, and so does Truffle.Also note that when testrpc first starts, it prints out a list of accounts that will be pre-funded with ether, along with a twelve-word seed phrase for re-generating those accounts. You can use this seed phrase to initialize your MetaMask client with the same accounts, and you\u2019ll have lots of Ether when you start! (Ether is used to pay for network usage, or gas, on the Ethereum network)If you wanted to start up testrpc with the accounts you already have in MetaMask, you can tell testrpc what seed phrase to use with the -m flag. For example:$ testrpc -m \"concert load couple harbor equip island argue ramp clarify fence smart topic\"Setting up a simple Truffle DappNext, let\u2019s generate a basic Truffle dapp. The default result of truffle initis a simple example currency.To get it up and running, run these commands:mkdir my-money # Create a folder for your new dappcd my-money # Move into that foldertruffle init # Initialize a default truffle project in that foldertruffle migrate # Build, compile, & deploy the dapptruffle serve # Host your web interface on port 8080We just deployed a simple alt-coin called MetaCoin to our local blockchain, and it's available to our browser on http://localhost:8080!If you visit it, you\u2019ll see that by default this new Dapp template signs you in with the first account on your testrpc account list, which happens to be the same account that got pre-populated with 10k shiny new Metacoins! That's because when you ran truffle migrate, Truffle used your first account as the contract publisher, and the contract says to fund the creator's account with 10k coins.You can now send those coins to any account you want, for example, the second account in your testrpc list! If you enter an address and a value, and hit send, you'll see your balance go down!If that seems a little too easy, I\u2019d agree with you! That\u2019s why Metamask gives the user an opportunity to approve every transaction that a Dapp attempts, and that\u2019s more secure!Let\u2019s try connecting to the same account through Metamask, and see how easy it is!Setting up MetamaskNow you\u2019ll want to install Metamask from the Chrome store.When you first open Metamask, it will let you either create a new wallet or restore from a seed. Since both Metamask and testrpc use the bip44 standard for wallet generation, you can Restore Existing Vault, and enter the mnemonic that testrpc output when you first started it. It should be 12 words long.You\u2019ll also need to provide a password, which is used to encrypt your wallet.By default you get three accounts, and they\u2019ll be the same as the first three accounts in your testrpc list.To use Metamask with your testrpc accounts, you need to point it at yourtestrpc address as its RPC provider, which by default is localhost:8545. MetaMask provides a menu item for quickly switching to this local port.Open MetamaskClick the current network name in the top right.Select your current testrpc address, which is probbly Localhost 8545.Metamask will close at this point to restart itself.You can now sign into your Dapp with Metamask.Open MetamaskEnter your passwordReload the Dapp page (some dapps will notice when you change accounts, but this basic one doesn\u2019t)You should now see your first account\u2019s MetaCoin balance! If you switch accounts, you should see theirs (none, unless you\u2019ve sent to one!).To send some Metacoin to one of your Metamask accounts, you\u2019re going to need that account\u2019s address.To copy a Metamask account\u2019s address:Open MetamaskClick the details arrow next to the account whose address you want.Click the \u201cCopy Address\u201d button.You now you have a copy of your address to send to!Sending Metacoin from Metamask: So Meta!If you connect to your first account, you should see you have some MetaCoin, and if we look in our Metamask plugin, we should have some ether too!It\u2019s important that we have ether, because it\u2019s not only a currency for trade, it\u2019s also the currency for processing transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. This processing fee is referred to as \u201cgas\u201d.Let\u2019s try sending some Metacoin from one of our Metamask accounts to another.Select the account that has the Metacoin and Ether, so that the Dapp shows a MetaCoin balance.Now we want to copy the address of another account you control to send to. In MetaMask, click the Switch Accounts icon in the top right.If you only have one account, click the + at the bottom of this screen to add a new account.When you see another account in the list, click the Copy Address button on it, and then you can paste that into the Dapp\u2019s To field, along with how much MetaCoin you'd like to send, and hit Send!You should see a notification pop-up, notifying you that you have a transaction to approve.You can now Approve or Reject the transaction, or close the notification, and review the transaction in MetaMask later.This is one way that Metamask is a safer Ethereum browsing experience than running your own RPC. While a pre-authenticated RPC automatically approves all requests sent to it, Metamask gives the user an opportunity to review and approve or reject each transaction that\u2019s requested by the dapp. Long term, making transactions easy to intelligently review is an important priority for MetaMask.Wrapping UpThis has been a simple example, but hopefully shows how Truffle and Metamask work together. They are able to pretty much work out of the box! That\u2019s because Truffle helps you write web3-compliant dapps. Web3 is a Javascript API declared by the core Ethereum team, and Metamask injects it directly into the Dapp\u2019s context!This makes connecting to a Truffle Dapp with Metamask as easy as connecting with your own RPC, but it\u2019s a lot easier for your users.That\u2019s because Metamask is a hyper-light client that doesn\u2019t replicate the entire blockchain locally, but it does let users manage their own accounts, so they can casually benefit from the security of private key management, while placing trust for block validation on Metamask\u2019s configured RPC provider.We hope this has been a useful introduction to developing with Truffle and Metamask!Please, leave a comment or question, start a discussion on github, or Tweet at us on Twitter.

We packed up our trusty Duster SUV, which we\u2019ve affectionately named Darcy, to continue our adventure to northern Croatia, an area known as Istria.Darcy, our DusterIstria is divided into two main areas: Green Istria, the forested, mountainous area located inland, and Blue Istria, which (you can probably guess this) is made up of the seaside towns located beside the Adriatic sea.Green IstriaGreen IstriaWhile driving through the region, Sean and I immediately noticed that it seemed as though every hilltop had a quaint settlement on top of it. I imagine that the purpose was for protection of the town during a seige \u2014 you would be able to see any invaders coming for miles! This thought has been reaffirmed by the fact that the majority of these towns are surrounded by a protective wall.We started our journey in the hilltop town of Oprtalj, a town boasting a whopping population of 55 people! It appears as though at one point the town was possibly larger but the majority of the houses have been abandoned and are slowly being reclaimed by the earth. It was quite beautiful to see the crumbling stone frames of houses with forests growing inside of them!OprtaljWe had the pleasure of staying in a renovated villa that was originally built in 1890. The villa was stunning \u2014 they kept a lot of the heritage charm with the renovation and I couldn\u2019t help but feel like a bit of a princess while walking through the house. The vista from the pool deck was enough to make your jaw drop, too! The gentleman running the place, David, has to be one of the nicest human beings we have ever met and also happened to be an amazing chef. The breakfast he cooked for us every morning is by far the best breakfast we have eaten on this trip. He made sure we had a great time in Oprtalj by ensuring we knew where to eat and what to see in the area.On our first day in Oprtalj we checked out both of the restaurants (yes, there are two, a surprising number for such a small town) and quickly realized that the food in Istria centers around one of my favourite delicacies \u2014 truffles! It\u2019s interesting to note that the food in Croatia is somewhat dependent on where you are staying. In general, coastal towns serve a lot of seafood, a culinary area that they have mastered. Inland, the focus shifts to meat \u2014 lamb, pork, and beef. In the north, they stick to this same formula but just top everything in copious amounts of truffles and oh my, are they delicious!Truffles, truffles everywhere!This is probably a great time to talk about Croatian cats as most restaurants also have their local cat that frequents the joint. Let\u2019s just say that I made friends with them all. There aren\u2019t that many stray dogs in the country as there are programs and shelters that ensure that any strays are picked up and paired with their forever human but it doesn\u2019t seem like the same courtesy exists for the felines of the country as there are a lot of strays everywhere. However, the cats are all very healthy and very friendly because each community takes care of their cats. They put out water and food for them on a daily basis. Our tour guide in Dubrovnik was telling us that there are old \u201ccat ladies\u201d in the city that go around feeding the cats. I thought he was pulling our leg until we saw an old lady going around with a bag of kibble leaving handfuls of foods for any cat she happened upon. Community cared for cats for the win (it sure beats the Italian break-your-heart starving kitties).Croatian Kitty FriendsWe made sure to take advantage of this truffle region by booking a truffle hunt with a local truffle hunter. We started out our tour by visiting the family\u2019s storefront where we were treated to a breakfast of everything truffle \u2014 truffle sausage, truffle cheese, truffle honey, etc. etc. etc. We even experienced a cooking demo on how to make truffled eggs and were astonished by the sheer amount of truffle that went into that one dish. I think it\u2019s safe to say that we ate more truffles in that one meal than we will ever eat in our lifetimes.We learned that there are more dogs that live in the town of Vrh than there are people because every family owns around 5 truffle hunting dogs. This is a huge industry in the area! In France, truffle hunters usually use pigs for the hunt as they naturally love truffles. However, in Istria they use dogs because although their sense of smell isn\u2019t as good as a pig\u2019s, they are fast, and much easier to transport!I found it interesting how they train the dogs to hunt the truffles. From an early age, usually around 3 months, they start feeding the puppies truffles. They usually start with truffle oil on bread and then progress to small pieces of truffle. Essentially, they just get the pups crazy addicted to truffles so that they search it out in the forest. You have to be quick on the hunt though, otherwise they will devour the truffle before you can stop them.Checking Layla\u2019s mouth for a truffle (we\u2019re pretty sure she ate more than we found that day!)We did get the opportunity to go out into the forest with our truffle hunter and three of his truffle dogs, two seasoned veteran dogs and one training puppy. The dogs had such an acute sense of smell that they were able to find truffles growing that were about the size of a pea (not that these ones are worth anything). We fortunately did find a plum-sized white truffle which on the off-season would be worth about \u20ac200.Overall, it was a super cool experience to see how truffle hunting is done. It\u2019s also incredible the amount of work that goes into finding each truffle which made us appreciate why the cost of truffles is so high!That evening, we decided that we did not have nearly enough truffles in our truffle breakfast \ud83d\ude1c so we went to the Michelin recommended truffle restaurant, Zigante. We treated ourselves to four wine-paired delicious courses of truffle inspired foods. This restaurant is a real treat for any foodie and we left with a belly full of the most delicious food.David, our host, booked us a wine tour and tasting at a local winery, Kozlovi\u0107. Although there are a few hundred wine-makers in Istria, he assured us that this was one of the best. The tour took us around their factory and they showed us how they go about making the wine. It was interesting that the EU gifted them a state-of-the-art bottling system which makes me think that they are trying to grow Croatian\u2019s wine region.After the tour, we did the tasting, the best part of any winery visit. Tastings are done very differently in Croatia as they tend to pour you full glasses of wine. You can really only visit about one winery per day otherwise you risk having to crawl home. It was a great introduction into Istrian wine and we got a taste for some of the more popular varietals of the region, Malvazija, the white wine, and Teran, the red.We spent the rest of our time in Istria checking out some of the medieval towns neighbouring Oprtalj including Motovun and Gro\u017enjan. We found that a lot of the towns are very artsy and the streets are lined with artisan shops selling everything from paintings to jewelry to hand-made leather goods. We also checked out an award winning olive oil producer, Ip\u0161a, and went to a honey shop where we did a honey tasting (and subsequently bought a lot of honey).Green Istria was fantastic. It was the perfect mixture of quiet, relaxing, and gorgeous but also left us with no shortage of things to do.

In my opinion, to know the value of ether and to take the advantage of this Blockchain Technology, getting hands on and diving into the smart contract development is the best and most effective way. I hope this series of tutorials will inspire you and lead you to start learning and applying smart contracts.After this extremely short tutorials, you can tell people,I just build my first smart contract this morning! [plus learned to debug]In this first tutorial, you will learn writing solidity language and truffle CLI tool to write and deploy a hello-world contract in a reasonably short amount of time.All resources are available in my GitHub repo as following.amazingandyyy/the-good-ethereum-smart-contract-tutorialthe-good-ethereum-smart-contract-tutorial - Repo for The Complete Ethereum Smart Contract Development tutorials series.github.comBefore we build the exciting contract, let me share you something useful knowledge, in case your friends ask you.What is Solidity? \u2014 An OOP programming languageEthereum Network is a distributed, purely decentralized developer network. Developers can deploy and run an application on the network that others can execute it and make things work. The application is called smart contract, and the official programming language to write a contract is generally Solidity, an OOP-fashion programming language. You can think it\u2019s like Swift for iOS and Kotlin for Android app.What is truffle? \u2014 A CLI tool.Truffle is a CLI helper tool, it helps developers\u2019 life easier and make the development process faster.Let\u2019s get started.The fast way to install solidity is using npm. It\u2019s official package called solc. The installing process usually takes around 30~60 minutes\u2026 I know\u2026 it\u2019s painful to wait, but you only need to do it once. (if you already have it installed, skip and go to next step)$ npm i -g solcOpen a new tab/window in your terminal. Type npm install command to install truffle:$ npm i -g trufflecreate a project called hello-ethereum-salon-contract and go to the project$ mkdir hello-ethereum-salon-contract$ cd hello-ethereum-salon-contractMake sure you are in the right directory/folder, then let\u2019s use truffle init to init a project. Truffle is just a CLI tool which helps us generate some robotic code snippets following the official Solidity Style Guide .$ truffle init Next, open the project/this folder in your favorite editor such as VSCode, Atom, Vim\u2026etc. The structure of the project should now look like the following:.\u251c\u2500\u2500 contracts\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 Migrations.sol\u251c\u2500\u2500 migrations\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 1_initial_migration.js\u251c\u2500\u2500 test\u251c\u2500\u2500 truffle-config.js\u2514\u2500\u2500 truffle.js3 directories, 4 filesLet\u2019s just ignore all these files for now. Next, use truffle create contract -ContractName- to create a new contract. (Note, by convention, the contract name is Camel Case, for example, ItsNiceToMeetYouMyFriend)$ truffle create contract HelloEthSalonit should look like this now:.\u251c\u2500\u2500 contracts\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 HelloEthSalon.sol\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 Migrations.sol\u251c\u2500\u2500 migrations\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 1_initial_migration.js\u251c\u2500\u2500 test\u251c\u2500\u2500 truffle-config.js\u2514\u2500\u2500 truffle.js3 directories, 5 filesAs you can see, there is a new file called HelloEthSalon.sol under the contracts folder and notice the extension of the file is called .sol and this is the file extension of solidity language, think like .js for JavaScript files or .html for HTML templates. This is what it looks like for the brand new HelloEthSalon.sol file.pragma solidity ^0.4.4;contract HelloEthSalon {  function HelloEthSalon() {    // constructor  }}As we can see, only the contract name is special. We are good to go, let\u2019s make some more exciting changes.Let\u2019s add two things:1. add one string global variable called message and initialize it with a content as 'Hello Ethereum Salon!' .2. add a new function called GetMessage() which will return the messageThe file should now look like following:pragma solidity ^0.4.4;contract HelloEthSalon {  string message = \"Hello Ethereum Salon!\";   function HelloEthSalon() {    // constructor  }  function GetMessage() return string {    return message;  }}Congratulations! You have your very first ever smart contract.But in order to make it smart, we need to make sure this contract/solidity code is correct and will not break down. It\u2019s easy, use truffle compile helper commands to check if everything is all right.$ truffle compileBoom! We got an error!\u279c truffle compileError parsing .../01-HelloWorld/contracts/HelloEthSalon.sol: ParsedContract.sol:6:3: ParserError: Expected token Semicolon got 'Function'  function HelloEthSalon() {  ^Compilation failed. See above.truffle complain there is a ParserError on line 6 which is token Semicolon got \u2018Function\u2019 .Nice catch! Let\u2019s fix it by add the missing ; at the end of line 4. Yes, change \u2018Hello Ethereum Salon!\u2019 to \u2018Hello Ethereum Salon!\u2019;do truffle compile again in your terminal;Oh! Again! one more error!

See above.compiler throws aParserError on line 10 and it's Expected token LBrace got \u2018Return\u2019. This is not a healthy and understandable report as we want, but I get it: from my experience and official document, the return should be changed to returns ~~ Nice catch again.Let\u2019s run truffle compile again in the terminal; Boom!\u279c truffle compileError parsing .../01-HelloWorld/contracts/HelloEthSalon.sol: ParsedContract.sol:10:33: ParserError: Expected token LParen got 'string'  function GetMessage() returns string {                                ^Compilation failed. See above.One more errors, but TRUST me, this is the last one in this tutorial. Well this will not be the last errors you will get (if you keep learning and doing development like a rock star )\u2026 so please don\u2019t be afraid of these errors, Errors are the most healthy and good sign when you doing coding especially when you do smart contract development. When you do truffle compile , the compile helpfully, generously help us find out the critical error, isn\u2019t it so handy? \ud83d\ude03Let\u2019s fix the ParserError by add parenthesis to the string (how I know to solve it like this? from previous experiences), so change function GetMessage() returns string { to be function GetMessage() returns (string) {Let\u2019s run truffle compile again in the terminal;If you get no error messages(you may get many warnings messages, but they can be ignored here) and have it show Writing artifacts to ./build/contracts~Congrats!

Like a Swiss army knife, Truffle packs together the best modules and tools to streamline smart contract creation, compilation, testing, and deployment onto Ethereum. In addition, it also supports frontend development using a Redux store that automatically syncs with the contract data. Thus, integration with React is simple and easy. For veterans who developed decentralized applications in the early days, the benefits of Truffle are obvious. For those new to dapp development, your timing is perfect!Written in JavaScript, Truffle modularizes key features to abstract away the complexity and cognitive load. However, if we simply depend on the framework for everything, we miss out on understanding how things actually work under the hood that makes blockchain so special. Any dabbler can code by following directions. Expertise and innovation, on the other hand, require awareness of underlying assumptions and the creativity to challenge them.Thankfully, since it\u2019s all just JavaScript, we should be able to mimic the main functionalities of Truffle from scratch. Starting from an empty node project, we will attempt to create a smart contract, compile it, test it, and deploy it to a real ethereum network. We will also link it to an actual user interface. In so doing, the author hopes to impart a deeper understanding of the core technologies such that development using Truffle is not a dependency, but an expression of a creative choice.Smart Contract1. Create2. Compile3. Test4. DeployUser Interface => Smart ContractA great primer is to have a clear mental model of the Ethereum application stack:A Complete Mental Model for Ethereum dApp DevelopmentBlockchain Application Development for Web Developersmedium.comOur project repo: https://github.com/HeartBankAcademy/dAppTruffle InitSince tokens are such an integral part of the Ethereum ecosystem, let\u2019s try to build one from scratch to better understand how Truffle works under the hood! With npm, we can begin by initializing an empty node project.$ npm initThen, we create empty files and folders with this architecture:build- Token.jsoncontracts- Token.solmigrations- compile.js- deploy.jstest- Token.test.jspackage.jsonLike a Truffle project, the contracts folder houses all the solidity files. By convention, these files should be capitalized to indicate that solidity contracts are akin to \u201cclasses\u201d from which contract \u201cinstances\u201d are instantiated. In our case, it\u2019s just Token.sol. The migrations folder houses the scripts that we use to compile and deploy our contracts. Running compile.js should compile all our solidity files into corresponding json files in the build folder. In our case, it\u2019s just Token.json.compile.js: contracts/*.sol => build/*.jsonWhen we run deploy.js, the bytecode inside our json files should be deployed onto the network of our choice.deploy.js: build/*.json => networkFinally, the test folder houses all our test files. In our case, it\u2019s just Token.test.js.In summary, our project directory should look like this:This step is \u201cequivalent\u201d to executing:$ truffle initWhich creates the following files and folders:Notice the similarities! \ud83d\ude09Truffle DevelopLike Remix, Truffle has a local blockchain we can use during development.$ truffle developWhen we execute this command, Truffle launches a local network on port 9545 and generates a mnemonic phrase from which the first 10 external accounts and private keys are shown for our convenience.Under the hood, Truffle uses a stripped-down version of ganache-cli (previously, TestRPC). Let\u2019s install it globally and then launch a local network to see the similarities.$ sudo npm install -g ganache-cli$ ganache-cliLike Truffle, ganache-cli also generates a mnemonic phrase and displays the first 10 external accounts and private keys. By default, blocks are mined instantly.Using the local network provided by Truffle on port 9545 is optional. If we prefer more controls over our local network, we can use ganache-cli instead by switching over to port 8545.// truffle.jsnetworks: {  development: {    host: \"127.0.0.1\",    port: 8545,    network_id: \"*\"  }}For example, with ganache-cli we can create a more realistic network by specifying a blockTime of 15 seconds.$ ganache-cli --blockTime 15Or, if we prefer a graphical user interface, we can use the ganache desktop app by switching over to port 7545.Now that we understand the function of ganache-cli, let\u2019s install it as a project dependency so we can import it for use later.$ npm install --save ganache-cliWe\u2019re now ready to start coding our smart contract!Truffle CompileTokens represent real-world assets, which we can buy with ethers. As such, the standard token contract, aka ERC20, is understandably complex. For simplicity, we can boil it down to this:In essence, a token contract is just an \u201cinternal\u201d public ledger. While the \u201cexternal\u201d public ledger records account balances in ethers, a token contract records account balances in \u201ctokens\u201d. We can achieve this by using a mapping data structure (balanceOf) with address as the key and uint256 as the value (line 4). As a map object, every \u201caddress balance\u201d in balanceOf will be initialized with 0.ethereum blockchain => \"external\" public ledgertoken contract => \"internal\" public ledgerThrough the constructor method, we can set the initialSupply of our tokens upon contract creation. For simplicity, the contract creator will initially possess all the tokens (line 6\u20138).Creator: msg.senderbalanceOf[msg.sender] = initialSupply;Thus, the distribution of tokens must begin from the contract creator. We can achieve this with a transfer method that accepts an address and a uint256 which specify to whom and how much (line 10\u201315).From: msg.sendertransfer(address _to, uint256 _value)Before decrementing the sender\u2019s balance and incrementing the recipient\u2019s balance by _value, we can perform require checks to ensure that the sender has sufficient tokens (line 11) and that the recipient\u2019s new balance does not overflow (line 12).require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= _value);require(balanceOf[_to] + _value >= balanceOf[_to]);balanceOf[msg.sender] -= _value;balanceOf[_to] += _value;Altogether, our token contract becomes:To compile our contract, we can use solc, which Truffle utilizes under the hood. Let\u2019s install it as a dependency:$ npm install --save solcWe want our compile.js script to begin by deleting everything in the build folder. That way, we can make changes to our contracts and recompile them anytime. In other words, we want to programmatically:Delete the build folder and everything inside.Recreate a new build folder.For each solidity file in the contracts folder, read its content to memory.For each solidity file in memory, compile it also to memory.For each compiled solidity file, write it to the build folder with .json as the extension.To build paths to our files, we can use the standard path module. To read and write files, it\u2019s easier to use the fs-extra module instead of the standard fs module. Let\u2019s install that:$ npm install --save fs-extraThus, our script should require in solc, path, and fs-extra:const solc = require(\"solc\");const path = require(\"path\");const fs = require(\"fs-extra\");To build a path to the build directory, we can write:const buildPath = path.resolve(__dirname, \"../build\");To delete the build directory and create a new one in its place, we can write:fs.removeSync(buildPath);fs.ensureDirSync(buildPath);To build a path to our token contract, we can write:const tokenPath = path.resolve(__dirname, \"../contracts\", \"Token.sol\");To read its content to memory, we can write:const source = fs.readFileSync(tokenPath, \"utf8\");To compile its content, we can call:solc.compile(source, 1)The second parameter tells solc the number of contract \u201cclasses\u201d that are present in our file. In our case, it\u2019s just the Token class. When compiled, it looks like this:Notice that it\u2019s a json object. We\u2019re only interested in :Token because it contains the bytecode and interface (ABI) that we need. Thus, to compile and write to memory:const output = solc.compile(source, 1).contracts[\":Token\"];Finally, to write output to the build folder as Token.json:fs.outputJsonSync(path.resolve(buildPath, \"Token.json\"), output);Altogether, compile.js becomes:To run our compile.js script, we can execute this command from the project root:$ node migrations/compile.jsThis step is \u201cequivalent\u201d to executing:$ truffle compileWith that, we\u2019re now ready to test our token contract!Truffle TestUnder the hood, Truffle uses the mocha testing framework with chai for assertions. Let\u2019s also use mocha:$ npm install --save mochaFor simplicity, we can just use the standard assert library.To be able to test our token contract, we need a local network and a way to connect to a running client, i.e., a provider. We can set one up with geth, but we will need to sign every transaction manually with Metamask (via port 8545). To get around this, we can use the ganache provider instead which comes with external accounts in an \u201cunlocked\u201d state.ganache provider => local node => local networkThen, we need a way to interact with this provider using JavaScript. We can use web3 for this.JavaScript => web3 => ganache provider Because transactions take time to process by the network, almost every web3 call is asynchronous. Though still in beta, version 1.0 of web3 supports Promises and therefore async and await which make code so much easier to read. Let\u2019s install it:$ npm install --save web3@1.0.0-beta.34Thus, our test script begins by requiring assert, ganache-cli, and web3:const assert = require(\"assert\");const ganache = require(\"ganache-cli\");const Web3 = require(\"web3\");Then, we can create an instance of Web3 with ganache.provider() as the constructor argument:const web3 = new Web3(ganache.provider());Now, we can use this web3 instance to instantiate our token contract. To do so, we will need the interface and bytecode from Token.json.const { interface, bytecode } = require(\"../build/Token\");To connect web3 with the interface, we can write:await new web3.eth.Contract(JSON.parse(interface))To deploy the bytecode, we can utilize the deploy method:.deploy({    data: bytecode,    arguments: [INITIAL_SUPPLY]})We can also pass in our constructor arguments to arguments as an array. To actually send the transaction, we can utilize the send method:.send({ from: accounts[0], gas: 1000000 })We use .send() whenever we want to update our contract\u2019s state. Such actions alway return the transaction hash except when deploying. Available parameters are from, gas, gasPrice, and value. The originating address (from) is required but the rest is optional (default values come from ganache). gas and gasPrice specify the gas limit and unit cost of gas, while value specifies how much wei to transfer. If we only want to read data on our contract, we use .call() instead. Reading data is always free..send() => update contract's state // not free.call() => read contract's state // freeAs we\u2019ve seen, ganache comes with 10 external accounts for us to use. We can access them through:accounts = await web3.eth.getAccounts();Thus, to deploy a fresh instance of our contract before each unit test, we can use the following test harness:Here, we\u2019ve arbitrarily chosen to deploy the contract from the first external account: accounts[0]We\u2019re now ready to write some unit tests! To begin, we should test that our token contract has indeed been deployed onto the local network. Whenever deployment is successful, web3 returns an instance of the contract that looks like this:Notice that we can access all our public variables and functions through the methods property. Notice also that under options, the address property contains the address to our contract instance on the network. We can use this fact to make an assertion that address must exist for the test to pass.it(\"deploys a contract\", () => {    assert.ok(token.options.address);});For our second test, let\u2019s verify that the contract creator does indeed have possession of all the tokens upon contract instantiation. Through the methods property, we can call balanceOf and pass it accounts[0].it(\"has initial supply\", async () => {    const supply = await token.methods.balanceOf(accounts[0]).call();    assert.equal(supply, INITIAL_SUPPLY);});For our third test, let\u2019s verify that our transfer method actually behaves as we intended.From: accounts[0]To: accounts[1]Amount: TOKENSResult: balance of accounts[0] and accounts[1] should updateTo make this transfer, we can call our transfer method through the methods property like so:await token.methods.transfer(accounts[1], TOKENS)    .send({ from: accounts[0] });To check that the transfer succeeded, we make two more calls to get the new balance of accounts[0] and accounts[1].const fromBalance = await token.methods.balanceOf(accounts[0]).call();const toBalance = await token.methods.balanceOf(accounts[1]).call();Then, we can verify that their balances have been appropriately updated:it(\"can transfer tokens\", async () => {    const TOKENS = 10;    const txHash = await token.methods      .transfer(accounts[1], TOKENS)      .send({ from: accounts[0] });    const fromBalance = await token.methods.balanceOf(accounts[0]).call();    const toBalance = await token.methods.balanceOf(accounts[1]).call();    assert.equal(fromBalance, INITIAL_SUPPLY - TOKENS);    assert.equal(toBalance, TOKENS);});For our last test, let\u2019s verify that the sender needs to have a sufficient balance.From: accounts[1]To: accounts[0]Amount: 10Result: should failTo do this, we can use a try/catch statement to catch the error and assert that it must exist:it(\"requires sufficient balance\", async () => {    try {        await token.methods.transfer(accounts[0], 10).send({ from: accounts[1] });        assert.fail();    } catch (error) {        assert.ok(error);    }});Putting all our unit tests together, we have:To run our tests with npm, we need to add mocha to our package.json file:\"scripts\": {    \"test\": \"mocha\"}Now, we can easily execute:$ npm run testThis is \u201cequivalent\u201d to executing:$ truffle testWith all tests passing, we\u2019re ready to deploy our contract to a real Ethereum network!Truffle MigrateDuring our tests, we used the ganache provider to deploy our contract to our local network. Likewise, to deploy our contract to the public Ethereum network, we need a provider that connects to a real Ethereum node. We could set one up locally with geth, but for simplicity, we will use Infura instead. Also backed by ConsenSys, Infura provides endpoints that we can utilize to easily create a provider.smart contract => ganache provider => local networksmart contract => Infura provider => public networkTo create a custom provider, we can use truffle-hdwallet-provider, which Truffle utilizes under the hood:$ npm install --save truffle-hdwallet-providerInfura provides endpoints to the main network as well as all the test networks. Let\u2019s use the Rinkeby testnet so we don\u2019t have to spend real money. Let\u2019s also create a new vault on Metamask for testing. With the Rinkeby endpoint from Infura and the seed phrase from Metamask, we can create a provider like this:const Provider = require(\"truffle-hdwallet-provider\");const provider = new Provider(\"pepper stable ripple enrich provide    business ankle tank net lumber acquire earn\", \"https://rinkeby.infura.io/DPHGLx2mBJeWsuDv1jFV\");// seed phrase and endpoint only needed until we deploy and attain the address to our contract on the blockchainLike before, we can pass our provider to web3 to get a fresh instance:const Web3 = require(\"web3\");const web3 = new Web3(provider);Reusing the deploy logic from our test harness with this web3 instance, we get:Under the hood, Metamask also uses Infura! For reference, we output the contract address to the console. To run this script, we execute:$ node migrations/deploy.jsOur token contract is now live on Rinkeby!https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x6431505264aEF4CfEA510633C8Ce5970404C821fThis is \u201cequivalent\u201d to executing:$ truffle migrateFinally, let\u2019s create a frontend that connects to our live contract!Truffle Unbox DrizzleTo setup the boilerplate for our frontend, we can use Truffle to \u201cunbox\u201d Drizzle.$ truffle unbox drizzleDrizzle is awesome because it comes with a Redux store that syncs with our contract state.react dapp => redux store => contract stateTo better understand how this process works, we will use create-react-app instead, which Drizzle utilizes under the hood. Let\u2019s install it globally:$ sudo npm install -g create-react-appAnd then run the create-react-app command to create a boilerplate project called \u201creactapp\u201d:create-react-app reactappTo launch this app, we execute this command from the project root:$ npm run startLet\u2019s update the main App component in src/App.js to show the balance and a form to transfer tokens:We want our users to be able to use Metamask to sign and submit transactions to our live contract. We can achieve this by taking advantage of the web3 object that Metamask injects to the global window:This web3 object comes with a built-in provider that we can use:window.web3.currentProviderHowever, notice that this web3 version is 0.20.3. To use version 1.0 instead, we need to install it as a dependency:$ yarn install --save web3@1.0.0-beta.34Then, we can take advantage of Metamask\u2019s provider like this:import Web3 from \"web3\";const web3 = new Web3(window.web3.currentProvider);By using our version of web3, we also ensure that it will not suddenly change and break our code. Understandably, Metamask plans to stop injecting the web3 object after realizing that most dapps only need its provider. In the near future, ethereumProvider will be injected instead.dapp => web3 => ethereumProvider => live contractLet\u2019s export our web3 instance for other files to use:To connect to our live contract, we need the ABI from our compilation process and the address of our contract on Rinkeby:const token = new web3.eth.Contract(ABI, ADDRESS);Copying over the ABI from Token.json and the contract address from running deploy.js, we can export our live contract instance like so:Now, we can import our token instance and web3 instance for our App component to use:In the componentDidMount lifecycle method, we can make a web3 call to get all the user\u2019s Metamask accounts (line 12):const accounts = await web3.eth.getAccounts();Then, we can call our token contract to get the balance of the first account (line 13):const balance = await token.methods.balanceOf(accounts[0]).call();In Metamask, the currently selected account is always accounts[0].To help process the form submittal, we can create a helper method that calls our contract\u2019s transfer function (line 18\u201332). Note that we don\u2019t have to specify the gas and gasPrice because Metamask will automatically calculate the best values for the user.form submit => react transfer method => contract transfer functionBecause transactions take time to process on a real network, we should provide a status message to inform the user:this.setState({ status: \"Transfer in progress...\" });Let\u2019s test the UI! When we choose the Metamask account that created the token contract (Account 1), we see the right balance of 1000, our initial supply.Selecting a different account shows the appropriate balance of 0. Let\u2019s now make a transfer of 50 tokens from \u201cAccount 1\" to \u201cAccount 2\u201d. Go to Metamask and copy the second account\u2019s address:Now past it into the form field:When we click \u201cTransfer\u201d, Metamask will open a modal to ask for confirmation:Even if no ethers are being sent, Metamask will always ask for confirmation because transactions are not free. After the network accepts our transaction, the user\u2019s balance should update:If we switch to \u201cAccount 2\u201d on Metamask, the balance should update too:Using the txHash that was returned, we can view our transaction in realtime on any blockchain explorer:https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/tx/0x2c081e0a67545b0e92a7e19eb156a446a5431aa3c2440a029556994dde49944dManual testing of the UI can be quite tedious. To help us automate testing of React components, create-react-app integrates with the Jest testing framework. In fact, Drizzle goes one step further, integrating with Redux to give us a store that syncs with our contract data.React component => Drizzle store => contract stateMoreover, Drizzle automatically generates forms for all our contract functions, which we can easily map to the appropriate reducers.form submit => Drizzle reducer => contract functionSince the reducers are mostly asynchronous web3 calls, Drizzle also integrates with redux-saga to make asynchronous testing a breeze!ConclusionWhat makes Ethereum special is its emphasis on the smart contract layer, which Truffle also emphasizes, providing a convenient framework and a higher-order abstract contract that decorates any Solidity contracts with the functionalities to compile, test, upgrade, and deploy, seamlessly. This article is a deep dive into those features with the hope of imparting a clearer understanding and a better intuition.For a real live example of how Truffle is used in one of our open source projects, check out:How to Decentralize the Film IndustryA Crowdfunding dApp to Empower Indie Filmmakers! \ud83d\udcaamedium.comIn this article, we open up the entire source code of our dApp to explain our entire thought process, from architecture to a fully functional UI across our entire development stack!We like to think of HeartBank\u00ae as the nonprofit twin of ConsenSys \ud83d\ude07Reference: https://truffleframework.com/docs/truffle/quickstart", "responses": 5, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Blockchain", "Solidity", "Truffle", "Dapps"]}, {"title": "Testing Solidity with Truffle and Async/Await", "post_link": "https://medium.com/coinmonks/testing-solidity-with-truffle-and-async-await-396e81c54f93?source=search_post---------8", "author_name": "Angello Pozo", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@angellopozo", "publish_date": "2017-08-10", "last_modified_date": "2018-12-10", "readtime": "4.75", "claps": 665, "voters": 101, "content": "Testing Solidity with Truffle and Async/AwaitAngello PozoFollowAug 10, 2017 \u00b7 5 min readIf you were to ask a programmer/developer what the worst part of the job is, I think most would say writing tests. You have to create mock data and do coding backflips to get specific things to work properly. On top of that you have to write many different cases for a single feature/function. It takes a lot of time write good tests. But with the introduction of async/await in node 8, writing tests becomes much nicer! Its what we used to create over 100 tests for HelloSugoi.Audience:Mostly for developers who are writing Ethereum applications in Solidity and are writing tests for their code in Javascript. And for anyone curious about making async/await and how it can help write better tests.Requirements/installation:With node 8, async/await was enabled by default. Prior to version 7.6 you could use async/await as long as you added the --harmony-async-await flag. For version prior you could also use Babel to transpile down to ES5 compatible javascript. I suggest installing Node 8 or above for this project to work properly. You can use homebrew or nvm to manage the version you are using.In addition to having node installed you need to have Truffle and Ganache-cli installed globally.npm install -g trufflenpm install -g ganache-cliTruffle is used to compile and migrate Solidity contracts onto Ethereum networks. Ganache-cli is used as a fake Ethereum node that returns immediately instead of 15 seconds. To confirm you have everything installed try the following:Node \u2265 7.6 confirm by entering node -v in command linenpm \u2265 4 confirm by entering npm -v in command lineTruffle \u2265 3.3 confirm by entering truffle -v in command lineGanache-cli \u2265 5.0.0 confirm by entering ganache-cli -v in command lineExample Project Setup:I have an example project repo with all our code. If you want to work on it, please clone and install its dependencies.git clone https://github.com/sogoiii/truffle-async-await-testscd truffle-async-await-testsnpm install or yarn installtruffle compiletruffle testThe fourth command runs all the tests and they should successfully complete.How Async/Await Works:Conceptually, async/await makes asynchronous JavaScript code look like synchronous code. Let\u2019s compare the two:Comparing simple truffle test as promise chain or async/awaitFrom the sample above, I think the status2 method looks cleaner than the status method. It literally has 4 lines of boilerplate, which is more then the 3 lines of logic in status2. I think the choice is easy!To use async/await you need to add the async moniker to the function declaration. This tells the v8 interpreter to look for the await key, Otherwise node throws an error asking what await is. You put await in front of any promise function/method, not a callback! If your function is a callback, I suggest using a package like bluebird or the native promisify method that was introduced in Node 8. Luckily, Truffle returns promises instead of callbacks.An async function (async function(){}) also returns a promise! This is nice because then you can chain promises or async functions if desired. Like in the example below:Async returns a promiseA while ago async/await had a decently large performance hit. It was big enough that not using async/await was reasonable. Since the release of v8 5.5 performance has only gotten better. Unless you are doing something computationally heavy, using async/await may be a good alternative.Example (Easy Case):Truffle is nice because .deployed returns a promise. Remember, only place await in front of promises!Open the test/metacoin.js file and look at the very first test.Truffle easy test exampleThe first test only does 3 operations. The first is to get the deployed contract JavaScript object and sets it to the variable meta. Then it calls the function getBalance.call() function behind the await keyword. Again, this is because .call returns a promise. Finally, we simply check that the function returned the expected value inside an assert. Easy peasy! All its checking is if the balance of meta is 1000 as per the test title.When you run truffle test test/metacoin.js in the command line, you will see how all the tests run successfully.Example (Error Case):To catch errors with async/await, you need to wrap the call inside of a try/catch.Truffle fail test exampleIn the test above, I am calling a function that I know does not exist in the Solidity contract. Await will throw an error that is caught in the try/catch. Because I want to verify that calling someNonExistentFn throws an error, I return true inside of the catch to exit out of the test. If await meta.someNonExistentFn() was successful, the catch block would not be called and the next line throw new Error(...)would be hit. Thus telling me that he function failed to throw.Example (Time Travel):Sometimes a Solidity contract may have a function that only works when called in the future. In MetaCoin.sol I add the onlyAfterDate function modifier to specialFn where I define when in the future a function may be callable.MetaCoin.sol with time info onlyInside of the MetaCoin constructor I manually set endTime to 1 days. Time variables in Solidity are uint of epoch seconds. The onlyAfterDate function modifier uses endTime , which means any function with onlyAfterDate will only be callable in 1 days.To test this functionality, we are not going to wait 1 whole day! And what happens when the time is more dynamic, rather than hard-coded? Ganache-cli added a RPC method called evm_increaseTime that will time travel the blockchain.Ganache-cli evm_increaseTime as a promiseAll we have to do is make an RPC call to web3 with evn_increaseTime and params. I wrapped the callback-based web3 into a promise so we can use it with async/await.With that new function, we simply await with a time and boom! It\u2019s a few days later! If you are on Testrpc 4.0.0 (and older version of ganache-cli), there is a bug where a block must be mined for evm_timeTravel to take effect. You can review the bug here.Successful time travel with Truffle and Ganache-cliLarge Comparison:The two snippets below test for the exact same thing. The only difference is one is written as a promise chain and the other with async/await. Just driving the point home!Large Promise Chain Truffle TestLarge Async/Await Truffle TestConclusion:I hope you can see how much nicer tests can be with async/await. A lot of boilerplate goes away, which increases readability. Catching errors may be more tedious, but they are manageable. Plus if you need to time travel for you tests, Ganache-cli provides a method to update time. If you are using promises already, then integrating with async/await is very easy. If you have a lot of callbacks, then using require('utils').promisify makes your life easy.

This got me intrigued, so I wanted to build something useful using this technology to better understand what are the challenges and opportunities in this space. This post is the first of two describing my experience of building my first distributed Ethereum Blockchain app.I\u2019ll go over the steps needed to build a Smart Contract, how to compile and deploy it to a local Blockchain network and how to build a server side rendering React app in order to interact with our contract.Before getting into the code I would suggest one to go over Ethereum Overview on truffle website to get some concepts and terms down before proceeding.In this post I\u2019ll go over:Setting up The Development EnvironmentWriting and Testing a Smart ContractCompiling and deploying our Smart ContractOur DApp (decentralized application)As the fall tv season just started in the US, we would like to use the Blockchain (Ethereum) as an efficient way to handle the mapping of a user\u2019s and their favorite tv shows.The app displays a list of shows coming from rotten tomatoes unofficial API. Split into three categories: Fresh, New and Popular.A special section in the app \u201cBookmarks\u201d displays a list of user\u2019s favorite shows which are currently stored on the Blockchain.Users are able to add or remove shows from their Bookmarks section. Every time a user adds or removes a show a Smart Contract function is invoked and the change is stored on the Blockchain.The front-end app is a server side rendering React app powered by Next.js, for state management we\u2019ll use MobX, styling and layout will come from the awesome tachyons project and in order to interact with the Blockchain we\u2019ll write a Smart Contact in solidity, write tests for it in JavaScript and deploy it locally using truffle.Setting up The Development EnvironmentMake sure you have node, git and nvm install before starting this.First we need to install TestRpc and Truffle:npm install -g ethereumjs-testrpcnpm install -g truffleNow clone the app and install the dependencies://clone the repogit clone git@github.com:liors/tvdapp.git// Navigate to within the directorycd tvdapp//install dependenciesyarn installImplementing the Smart ContractOur app uses the Blockchain in order to store user\u2019s favorite shows. In order to do that we need to implement a Smart Contract that acts as its backend logic and storage.Under the /contracts directory you can find a Bookmark.sol file:If you\u2019re new to solidity (like me) their docs site has a \u201csolidity by example\u201d section which I found very useful.A bit about the contract. We start by declaring a contract which we name Bookmark. The contract has two public APIs.bookmark \u2014 which except a string that represent a show. I choose to store a JSON that will be reuse in our app UI. As another approach one could store a reference ID to some external storage.getBookmarks \u2014 which will return an array of shows per account.Testing the Smart ContractYou can write tests to Smart Contracts in either solidity or JavaScript.For JavaScript tests Truffle uses the Mocha testing framework and Chai for assertions.Under the /tests directory you can find a bookmark.js file:In order to run the tests you first have to have a local instance of testrpc. Once your EthereumJS TestRPC session start you can execute the tests:yarn testLet\u2019s go over the cases we would like to cover:A case when a client requests to bookmark a show \u2014 In this case we first get the instance of our contract, then call the public API \u2018bookmark\u2019 which except a string as it\u2019s first argument and a configuration object that includes the \u2018from\u2019 attribute. We then call the second getBookmarks public API as a result we get back a promise which when resolved should contain the show (string) we pass to the bookmark function.A case when a client requests to bookmark a list of shows \u2014 Same as our first use-case, but now we want to make sure we can store a list of shows, as such we will first bookmark few shows by passing an array of JSON objects and call our getBookmarks function to verify our Smart Contract is valid.Deploying our Smart Contract to a local BlockchainWe have just implemented and tested our Bookmark Smart Contract, it\u2019s time to compile it and migrate (deploy) it to our test network.CompilationSolidity is a compiled language, meaning we need to compile our Solidity to bytecode for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) to execute.Start a new terminal window and invoke the testrpc module we installed globally:testrpcThis starts a local Ethereum blockchain instance.2. Now let\u2019s compile the Smart Contract we implemented:truffle compileThis will compile our .sol file(s). You should see the output of this compilation as JSON(s) files in build/contracts folder.Deploying/MigrationI\u2019ve used the default migration file provided when you run truffle init. You can find it under /migrations/1_initial_migration.js.Under the /migration folder you can also find 2_deploy_contracts.js. This file requires our Smart Contract i.e., Bookmark.sol and deploy it:const Bookmark = artifacts.require('./Bookmark.sol')module.exports = deployer => deployer.deploy(Bookmark)In order to execute this script run:truffle migrateWe have just deployed our contract to a local Blockchain network!In the next post we\u2019ll go over our React app and see how we can use Next.js, MobX and web3.js to build a UI that interacts with our Smart Contract we just implemented.The complete code for this app is available on github.A live version of the app is deployed here \u2014 Please make sure your browser can run DApps, I\u2019ve been using MetaMask chrome extension.Thanks for reading.

It\u2019s only temporary. A page refresh clears the authentication information only stored in the Browsers DOM.To persist an authenticated decentralized session you might use LocalStorage or a storage library like RxJS (with \ud83e\udd17 streams)to manage data.By persisting state within the Browser\u2019s LocalStorage and/or using ServiceWorkers to fetch data the decentralized authentication verification information can still be accessed even after a page refresh.For example if you have a website, which is NOT a single page application you probably fetch pages from a backend server one at a time (or maybe with async magic) and need to maintain the ability to pass DOM state from one HTML Document to the next.LocalStorage is your friend.Smart Contracts \u2014 Just An OptionW don\u2019t use Truffle\u2019s ability to easily compile and deploy smart contracts, but the folder structure is in place. In other words, if you want to experiment with uPort and also smart contract deployment, you totally can!However, for this project we won\u2019t have to worry about the contracts and migrations folder, because it\u2019s not in the scope of the current project.We don\u2019t recommend deleting the files (for future reference) but if you feel the need to keep folder structure as minimal as possible, we understand completely./src/contracts <= Solidity ready to be compiled/src/migrations <= Smart Contract deployment settingsThe truffle.js and truffle-config.js files control the build and deployment process of Ethereum Smart Contracts.

Is now a good time for you to jump into this collection of tools? You will have a clear answer after reading this article.The Truffle suite consists of 3 main tools; Truffle: the all in one Ethereum dapp development environment, Ganache: a personal, configurable development blockchain with its own GUI, and Drizzle: the newest edition of the suite that synchronises contract state, event and transaction data in a redux store for your front end \u2014 which unsurprisingly works very well with React.Now, this is a lot to absorb; decentralised dapp development is a relatively new idiom. With new tools come new workflows, new ways to test, deploy, and update. What we will do here is break down each of the 3 Truffle suite tools, their capabilities, how to install and use them, and finish off with overviewing the Drizzle React project using a Truffle Box \u2014 pre-built Truffle boilerplate we can download using the truffle unbox command; more on this later.This is not a talk on Solidity programming, but as an overview of the entire Dapp development process \u2014 if you would like to research more into Solidity specifically, check out my article on the subject aimed as an on-boarding tool for you to start writing Solidity 0.5+ smart contracts:Writing Smart Contracts with Solidity > 0.5A brief walkthrough to start writing Ethereum smart contracts with Solidity 0.5 and abovemedium.comUnderstanding Truffle at a High LevelTruffle is a development environment, testing framework and deployment pipeline for Ethereum dapps \u2014 or any blockchain using the EVM. This section breaks down what exactly this means. For the sake of simplicity, we will refer to Ethereum (ETH) only, and not \u201cAny EVM blockchain\u201d, as the Ethereum (ETH) mainnet is Truffle\u2019s main target production blockchain.Truffle is operated in the Terminal, and as such has a range of handy commands for us to use at different stages of developing a dapp.What might such a development process look like? Let\u2019s break a hypothetical scenario down at a high level to get an initial feel of what it\u2019s like to use Truffle. Let\u2019s start a fresh Truffle based dapp project:Using Truffle\u2019s unbox command, we can firstly download a pre-built boilerplate project to bootstrap our dapp. These pre-built projects range from React with Truffle and Webpack boilerplate to ERC20 smart contract examples and tutorials. To get a feel about boxes at this stage, check them out here.If we wanted to create a project from scratch, truffle init is run in your root project directory. This will create a very bare bones structure for you to work with. Unless your dapp is very niche with absolutely no boilerplate suitable, unboxing is more favourable to truffle init.With the project now unboxed (or inited) and local on our machine, we notice a folder structure within our root project directory; a structure that Truffle adheres to throughout its examples and through the init command; namely contracts/, migrations/ and tests/. As well as these folders, a truffle-config.js file will also be joining the party, acting as a configuration file for Truffle. Let\u2019s visit what these folders consist of.Truffle Project Structurecontracts/ \u2014 hosts your Solidity (.sol) and Vyper (.vy) contract files. All your smart contracts associated with your project are stored in this folder.migrations/ \u2014 hosts your migration files. Let\u2019s stop here and define migrations in more detail. Migrations are files written in Javascript that programatically deploy smart contracts onto an Ethereum blockchain.A migration is essentially just a set of instructions. The simplest example of a migration looks like the following:var MyContract = artifacts.require(\"MyContract\");module.exports = function(deployer) {  // deployment steps  deployer.deploy(MyContract);};We are importing the MyContract Solidity file and using a deployer object provided by Truffle to deploy said contract onto a blockchain.but which blockchain?It can be either the mainnet, a testnet, or a local private blockchain, which coincidentally Truffle provide 2 of for testing purposes. Truffle provide 2 local blockchain solutions: Truffle Develop and Ganache. Both Truffle Develop and Ganache spawn a blockchain for us to test our code on. But where Truffle Develop only provides us with a CLI, Ganache also gives us a fully-fledged GUI making it more capable and user friendly. We will explore these in more detail further down.Back to /migrations. Now, in order for Truffle Migrations to work, a Migrations contract is required, the purpose of which is to supply a specific interface for managing Truffle deployments. This contract is automatically generated with truffle init, and should be present in all Truffle boxes.And because this Migrations contract is required, there is also an 1_initial_migration.js file sitting in your migrations/ folder ready to deploy the contract. The 1_ filename prefix is just for human readability.As more migrations are introduced to your project, this number should be incremented. In fact this was an intentional design feature of migrations; Truffle remembers which migrations have already been run, and only re-runs every migration when the special --reset flag is used with truffle migrate. It makes sense to order your migrations to keep track of which migration is the latest one, and to observe how your project is evolving.Truffle provide some great documentation on Migrations. To delve deeper into them now, visit https://truffleframework.com/docs/truffle/getting-started/running-migrations.The last folder we have not covered is tests/.tests/ \u2014 hosting unit tests for your smart contracts. Tests can be written in Javascript, Typescript, Solidity, and now, Vyper, all of which are stored under the same directory. In Javascript, Truffle uses the Mocha testing framework and Chai for assertions, providing tried and tested tools for the job.For local development blockchains like Truffle Develop and Ganache, Truffle uses \u201cadvanced snapshotting features\u201d ** to ensure that each test is isolated and does not share state with other tests. For testing on clients such as go-ethereum, or other external clients, all your migrations are re-deployed at the beginning of every test file to ensure freshness of contract state.Running on these clients will take considerably more time to complete tests, whereas Ganache and Truffle Develop take advantage of \u201cspecial features\u201d to speed up test runtime up to 90%. When considering speed, we can also configure these test blockchains to instantly mine blocks, as well as other optimisations to speed up testing.** Obscure language taken from the Truffle documentation, further insights of which are not provided in the documentation.If you are curious about testing in Truffle and would like to get into more details now, start with the documentation here: https://truffleframework.com/docs/truffle/testing/testing-your-contractsBy discussing the initial Truffle boilerplate we are now aware of how Truffle handles the deployment and testing of smart contracts. Contracts are developed within the contracts folder, before being migrated onto a blockchain, and then tested using Truffle\u2019s automated testing capabilities. Of course, contracts need to be written, and IDEs such as Sublime Text do indeed provide syntax styling for Solidity. Check out the Sublime Package, named Ethereum, here. Vyper syntax simply adheres to python.Your contracts have been written. We now need to deploy them on a network and connect to that network to access said contracts. (\u201cnetwork\u201d in this context meaning Ethereum blockchain). What is left to explore is how to connect to an Ethereum network in Truffle. This is handled in truffle-config.js, sitting in your project root directory.Configuring Ethereum Networks inside Truffle Configtruffle.config.js allows us to configure networks we\u2019d like to connect to. The default configuration looks like this:truffle-config.js:module.exports = {  networks: {    development: {      host: \"127.0.0.1\",      port: 8545,      network_id: \"*\" // Match any network id    }  }};As you can see, a development network has already been configured for localhost. By default Truffle Develop runs on localhost:9545 whereas Ganache runs on localhost:8545. Truffle is ready to communicate with Ganache out of the box. These blockchains are also assigned a random network ID that has no relation to real-world public Ethereum blockchains (the mainnet is network ID 1, for example).We can expand this config file to include more networks, such as a live mainnet. We are not limited to what we call networks, but Truffle have opted to use live for the mainnet:module.exports = {  networks: {    development: {      ...    },    live: {        host: \"<host_ip_address>\",        port: 80,        network_id: 1    }  }};Now if we wanted to deploy our contracts on the live network, we can call migrate with the --network flag:truffle migrate --network liveThis flexibility allows us to define a range of networks and migrate to them as when we please, which is very useful as you move from local testing blockchains to a mainnet deployment.It is now time to consider the front-end application. Along with the Truffle folders, the front-end app folder structure will also be present in the root directory of the Truffle project. For example, if Create React App is used with Truffle, the React app is also present in the root directory. In this said case, it is residing inside a separate web-app/ folder. Ultimately it is the developer\u2019s decision whether to combine Truffle and front-end project files, or to separate them like the Truffle+CRA project has opted for.As you are building your front end you wish to test communication with your smart contracts via web3. The best way to do this currently is by connecting to your local running Ganache blockchain via MetaMask in the browser. Let\u2019s briefly look at how to do this, before moving onto installing Truffle and visiting Drizzle.The web3 ProviderBy design, web3 looks for a web3 provider \u2014 a blockchain client or light node running with the capabilities to handle contract communication and make transactions on an Ethereum blockchain. This provider will vary depending on your preferred plugin or device (MetaMask, Cipher, a full go-ethereum node, etc).For development purposes web3 will be communicating with our Ganache or Truffle Develop blockchain \u2014 whichever one you opt to use for testing.So when it comes to testing your dapp on a public testnet (Ropsten, Rinkeby, etc), followed by a mainnet launch, your web3 provider must be running that same network in order to access the contracts.MetaMask makes it easy for us to connect to locally run EVM blockchains such as Ganache and Truffle Develop. The following screenshots demonstrate the process. Select Custom RPC from the Networks dropdown, and enter the local running blockchain URL. The custom network is then added to the list of networks:Adding a custom RPC in MetaMask connecting to a Ganache blockchainNow we have a means to test our front end dapp on our privately running blockchain, all running locally.From here your front-end dapp is developed further. It is then built and deployed in a production environment. At the same time, your smart contracts, now thoroughly tested, are deployed to the Ropsten Ethereum testnet. Switching to the Ropsten Network via Metamask allows us to test our production dapp on a public blockchain to help us identify any necessary amendments.Your smart contracts are ready to be migrated to the mainnet. Using truffle migrate again, they are deployed. Switching MetaMask to the Main Ethereum Network now gives us a true production experience of our dapp.Now our app will be running publicly. Fantastic.To continue our understanding of the Truffle suite, let\u2019s install Truffle and Ganache.Installing Truffle and GanacheInstall the latest version of Truffle globally with npm:npm install -g truffle@latestIn addition, install Ganache from the following web page: https://truffleframework.com/ganache. Check out all the available platforms here.As mentioned above, Ganache provides a GUI for displaying blockchain state. Upon blockchain instantiation 10 accounts are created, as well as a mnemonic. Your mnemonic is a special secret created for you by Ganache. It\u2019s used to generate the blockchain\u2019s account addresses as well as sign transactions. Do not use your mnemonic outside of development.Ganache will automatically instantiate a blockchain, accessible via localhost:8545. The network itself can be configured in the settings section.By default Ganache speeds up the blockchain; blocks are auto-mined and transactions are processed instantly. Private keys are accessible with one click, and blocks and transactions can be browsed through lists provided by the GUI.Ganache also has a CLI that can be installed with npm install -g ganache-cli allowing interaction directly from your Terminal.Check out more Ganache documentation here.What about Truffle Develop?A Truffle Develop blockchain can be instantiated by running truffle develop in your Terminal, and can be configured within truffle-config.js:module.exports = {  networks: {    ...   develop: {      accounts: 5,      defaultEtherBalance: 500,      blockTime: 3    }  }};Remember, a Truffle Develop blockchain is spawned on port 9545. But like Ganache, 10 accounts are spawned with 10 private keys, as well as a mnemonic, all of which are displayed in the Terminal.Get started using Truffle Develop from the official documentation here.It is useful at this point to familiarise yourself with some Truffle commands. The Truffle documentation has a dedicated page that lists the full set of commands. Don\u2019t let \u201cfull set\u201d intimidate you; there are a modest range of commands that are relatively easily understood. By now at least their purpose and usage should be mostly understood relative to this talk.Before wrapping up this introduction let\u2019s briefly visit Drizzle \u2014 the latest instalment of the Truffle suite that solves the problem of blockchain state management in-app. Drizzle is still an early stage product, but is a useful addition to any state managed dapp.Let\u2019s see what Drizzle has to offer, and install the React Drizzle Box.DrizzleWhy was Drizzle added to the Truffle Suite? It automatically syncs chain data to a Redux store so developers don\u2019t have to worry about doing so while developing a front-end dapp.Drizzle can be configured to either sync chain data on every block, or only when there are changes to contract data your app is listening to. It covers contract state, events and transactions.A Truffle Box is available for Drizzle that combines a Create React App setup with Drizzle and Drizzle React Components package. Installation instructions and more information on the box can be found on Truffle boxes. If you\u2019d like to download the box immediately, simply run truffle unbox drizzle.As this is an introductory article, I will not delve into a technical integration of Drizzle, however I have written a dedicated article introducing Drizzle and how to integrate it in a React project \u2014 check it out here:Drizzle for React: Introduction and Dapp Integration BreakdownHow to Integrate Truffle\u2019s chain-to-state syncing package, Drizzle, in your React projectsmedium.comNext StepsDo the tools of the Truffle suite sound like something you can adopt for your dapp development? The answer should now be clear to you \u2014 and if not please get in touch with queries.Truffle is the most widely adopted set of tools for Ethereum dapp development by far, and is now on version 5, bringing features like compiling Vyper contracts within the /contracts folder. This is a good sign.

There are however some instances where you may want to augment Truffle with a few tips in order to streamline your test writing and running.I\u2019ll talk about 3 specific tips:Using `async` and `await` vs. promisesCreating a shared context for multiple testsEmbedding tests in other testsUsing these tips should help reduce a significant amount of code duplication in your tests and allow you to write more readable tests.Using `async` and `await` vs. promisesTruffle comes with some tests out of the box and each test involves a lot of repeated boilerplate (which we\u2019ll talk about in 2) and uses promises.it(\"should call a function that depends on a linked library\", function() {    var meta;    var metaCoinBalance;    var metaCoinEthBalance;return MetaCoin.deployed().then(function(instance) {      meta = instance;      return meta.getBalance.call(accounts[0]);    }).then(function(outCoinBalance) {      metaCoinBalance = outCoinBalance.toNumber();      return meta.getBalanceInEth.call(accounts[0]);    }).then(function(outCoinBalanceEth) {      metaCoinEthBalance = outCoinBalanceEth.toNumber();    }).then(function() {      assert.equal(metaCoinEthBalance, 2 * metaCoinBalance,\"Library function returned unexpected function, linkage may be broken\");    });  });A bulk of the test is basic Promise \u201ccruft\u201d. Let\u2019s see what that test looks like rewritten with async and await.it(\"should call a function that depends on a linked library\", async function() {    var meta = await MetaCoin.deployed();    var metaCoinBalance = (await meta.getBalance.call(accounts[0])).toNumber();    var metaCoinEthBalance = (await meta.getBalanceInEth.call(accounts[0])).toNumber();assert.equal(metaCoinEthBalance, 2 * metaCoinBalance,\"Library function returned unexpected function, linkage may be broken\");  });Wow, what a difference!You can see that the savings comes from turning the test function itself into an async function and then having it await for each of the values it needs. Therefore, we don\u2019t need to write functions to handle each promise returned by the Truffle Contract instance meta of our contract MetaCoin.The other savings comes from being able to wrap the await response in brackets and convert directly from the object of type BigNumber into a JavaScript number using:(await meta.getBalance.call(accounts[0])).toNumber();Every uint256 returned from Solidity to JavaScript is an object of type BigNumber and can be converted to a number or string.Creating a shared context for multiple testsAnother useful trick is creating a shared context of variables that you would like to use in multiple tests, across multiple contracts.The way Truffle is initially setup doesn\u2019t make this immediately obvious, and it took some Mocha digging to find the right approach.Here\u2019s how Truffle sets up a test out of the box:contract('MetaCoin', function(accounts) { ... tests ... }Now if you wanted to require this test in another test, it would be difficult. And how would you pass the same basket of variables (context) created inside this test to other tests, i.e. the \u201cshared context\u201d you\u2019re trying to achieve.Here\u2019s a slight modification on running a test that has an export, returns a context JSON object, all placed in a new file called shared.js:const run = exports.run = async(accounts) => {  const meta = await MetaCoin.deployed();  it(\"should have MetaCoin deployed\", () => {    assert(meta !== undefined, \"MetaCoin is deployed\");  });  return { meta }};contract('Shared', run);Now we have a nice test function that is async and returns a context object with our contract instance. It will await the deployed instance of our Truffle Contract and we can return the instance to be used inside our other contracts like so:const shared = require('./shared.js');contract('MetaCoinSale', (accounts) => {  let meta; //explained in a moment  it(\"should have the shared context\", async() => {    context = await shared.run(accounts);    meta = context.meta;    //or...    ({ meta, ... } = context);    //make sure not undefined    assert(meta !== undefined, 'has MetaCoin instance');  });... tests can use MetaCoin instance now ...});And there we have it. The first test in your actual contract test script will wait for the shared context to be returned, because we made the entire test runner function async.//shared.jsconst run = exports.run = async(accounts) => { ... }You can also declare several other variables in shared.js and return them using the context object. In your contract tests, simply use assignment (or destructuring to keep the lines of code minimal) for variables. Also to keep things convenient, I keep context variables scoped to the main test runner function so that all tests can access them. You\u2019re off to the races in minimizing your test code.Why declare variables like meta for the MetaCoin contract instance outside all your tests like this? It greatly simplifies each test you write, otherwise you would have to call:const meta = await MetaCoin.deployed();From inside each test case. Some might not like this, but the approach has been working out fine for me so far.Embedding tests in other testsThis is essentially the same modification of decoupling the test runner function from the truffle contract call as in shared.js. For MetaCoin it looks something like this:const run = exports.run = (accounts) => {  ... MetaCoin tests ...};contract('MetaCoin', run);You would then use this in another contract like so:const metaTests = require('./metacoin.js');contract('MetaCoinSale', (accounts) => {  ...  metaTests.run(accounts);  ...});Note that an actual contract test runner is NOT async:const run = exports.run = (accounts) => {It will derail your whole shabang if it was\u2026 I\u2019m getting a bit tired writing this post but give it a shot making it async and watch it break :)All your test can still be async like this though:const run = exports.run = (accounts) => {  it(\"should do some async magic\", async() => { ... }};contract('MetaCoin', run);And that\u2019s it! Those are my tips. Go forth, write small tiny tests and make some great, secure smart contracts.", "responses": 1, "tags": ["JavaScript", "Solidity", "Blockchain", "Ethereum", "Testing"]}, {"title": "A Beginner\u2019s Guide to Truffles (and \u2018Truffle Oil\u2019)", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@nkolakowski/a-beginners-guide-to-truffles-and-truffle-oil-a3c743c9c391?source=search_post", "author_name": "Nick Kolakowski", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@nkolakowski", "publish_date": "2018-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-07", "readtime": "4.58", "claps": 240, "voters": 34, "content": "A Beginner\u2019s Guide to Truffles (and \u2018Truffle Oil\u2019)Nick KolakowskiFollowFeb 2, 2018 \u00b7 5 min readWorth its weight in gold, almost.Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin, the 18th century French gourmand, once referred to truffles as the \u201cdiamonds of the kitchen,\u201d and for centuries the world has agreed. A truffle can intrigue even the most jaded foodies: warty and lumpy in appearance, yet as prized as an expertly cut diamond, it is distinctively musky in taste, and capable of enhancing so many dishes.Yet such enhancement comes at a cost. Whether shaved raw over pasta or crostini, or stuffed into meats or p\u00e2t\u00e9, truffles can skyrocket the price of a dish. In 2007, a Macau casino owner paid $330,000 for a rare truffle that weighed 3.3 pounds; while that was an extreme case, the scarcity of truffles guarantees a price per pound in the hundreds or even thousands of dollars. A few years ago, despite a bumper crop due to heavy rains, Italy\u2019s prized white truffles \u201conly\u201d cost $280 for 100 grams.Simply put, a truffle is the fruiting body of the Ascomycota fungus, which enjoys a symbiotic relationship with the roots of beech, oak, hazel, and other trees. Truffles are subterranean, preferring alkaline or neutral soils with good drainage, which is why truffle-hunters rely on trained dogs or hogs to sniff them out. Because truffles only grow beneath certain kinds of trees, in very exacting weather and soil conditions, and because they take so much effort to find, prime specimens are quickly snatched up on the open market.At this point, you\u2019re probably wondering: Are they worth the expense?But Before We Get to That Part\u2026The different types of truffles all boast unique attributes:Complex, delicious and aromatic, white truffles (scientific name: Tuber magnatum) are also notable as the most expensive variety of truffle. Prized examples hail from select regions in northern Italy and France, as well as the southern reaches of Eastern Europe, with arguably the most famous coming from around the Italian town of Alba. As the name implies, these truffles are pale, often marbled with delicate veins and ridges of brown. Many chefs opt to shave white truffles raw over hot dishes such as pasta, with the heat unlocking the delicate yet pungent flavors.Although not nearly as expensive as their white counterparts, black truffles (Tuber melanosporum) are nonetheless adored with equal fervor by many chefs, who enjoy using them on everything from risotto to fish \u2014 and unlike white truffles, which are usually served raw, black truffles can be cooked as part of the dish. France, Italy and Spain account for the majority of black truffles found in the wild.Summer Truffles (Tuber aestivum) and burgundy truffles (Tuber uncinatum) are found throughout Europe, and generally come with the same brown or blackish hue, although the inner flesh of summer truffles is on the paler side. Burgundy truffles are harvested later, in autumn, than summer truffles, which as the name implies are rooted from the ground between May and August. Either will substitute in dishes for the more expensive black truffle.A number of European events center on the truffle, such as Italy\u2019s annual Alba International White Truffle Fair (also known as Fiera del Tartufo), where the latest specimens from the fall harvest are on display; the invite-only festival is the perfect place to see how chefs pair food and wine with the prized fungi. Over in France, there\u2019s the notable truffle market in the village of Richerenches, held every Saturday from November through March.Nor is Europe the only location for celebrations of everything truffle. The annual Oregon Truffle Festival, for example, highlights the state\u2019s longstanding cultivation and research into truffles, and features a variety of chefs as guests.It\u2019s Hard to Grow These ThingsHumans have treated truffles as a delicacy for hundreds of years. Roman intellectuals such as Cicero and Juvenal praised them; kings and queens of Europe devoured them; agriculturalists and farmers spent centuries attempting to domesticate them, with varying degrees of success. In Australia, New Zealand, and parts of the United States, farmers have set aside significant tracts of land for truffle cultivation, although results have been mixed despite the insights of modern science. A grower in California might find the right growing conditions, and spend years tending to the host trees, only to yield a disappointingly small number of truffles.In order to have even a decent shot at cultivating truffles, a grower must take several factors into account: Suitable trees to provide a home and nutrients, soil that\u2019s just the right degree of alkaline, moderate weather, a lack of competition from other vegetation, and time \u2014 lots of time. Plant a tree with roots loaded with truffle spores, as modern technique dictates, and you might need to wait a decade before the resulting truffles are mature enough for harvest.The summer before truffles reach that optimum moment, they gorge on nutrients, grow plump, and, as the season shades into autumn, begin to emit a distinctive smell that perks the noses of hogs, dogs, and rodents. If things follow their natural course, the animal digs up and eats a truffle, spreading its spores over a wide area, and the cycle of life continues anew. The duty of the truffle-hunter \u2014 and by extension, the chef \u2014 is to snatch the truffle from that cycle at exactly the right moment, without the truffle-hunting hog eating it first.What About That Truffle Oil Stuff?You may have seen truffle oil on the shelf of your local specialty store, or even at your local pizza place. You might even think that all truffle oil is made from actual truffles. In reality, many brands of truffle oil (particularly the cheapest ones) are synthetic, without so much as a molecule of real truffle; many chefs banish these chemical imposters from their kitchens. \u201cIt\u2019s garbage olive oil with perfume added to it,\u201d Joe Bastianich, founder of the New York City food emporium Eataly, once proclaimed in an interview with The Huffington Post.But chefs may look more favorably upon infused truffle oil, an entirely different beast that derives its taste from actual truffles, and use it to add another layer of aroma and flavor to select dishes.This meal\u2026 isn\u2019t cheap.So\u2026 Is It Worth the Cost?Many of those who sample an actual truffle in the flesh (as it were) claim that it\u2019s an unforgettable experience, rich and overwhelming. Others can\u2019t stand the taste. Like many luxury items (and indeed, most foods), the \u2018worth\u2019 is completely subjective. But it\u2019s certainly worth trying at some point, if you get the opportunity; after all, it takes a lot of time and effort for even a shaving of these exotic fungi to reach your table.", "responses": 1, "tags": ["Food", "Cooking", "Luxury", "Truffle", "How To"]}, {"title": "Migrating your Truffle project to Web3 v1.0", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@adrianmcli/migrating-your-truffle-project-to-web3-v1-0-ed3a56f11a4?source=search_post", "author_name": "Adrian Li", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@adrianmcli", "publish_date": "2018-07-13", "last_modified_date": "2018-08-11", "readtime": "3.58", "claps": 255, "voters": 30, "content": "Migrating your Truffle project to Web3 v1.0Adrian LiFollowJul 13, 2018 \u00b7 4 min readThe most popular library for calling into Ethereum smart contracts from the Javascript world is Web3.js (repo). In fact, Truffle (the popular Ethereum dapp framework) injects this within their own test environment.Unfortunately, the framework itself (and its official examples) use the 0.20.x version of Web3.js. And while v1.0 is still technically in beta, more and more people are using it because it provides an API that is more explicit and is easier to work with (like PromiEvents, I\u2019ll talk about this below).In this article, I\u2019ll show you how to convert your Truffle tests to use the new Web3.js v1.0 API rather than the older 0.20.x versions. In the process, I will introduce some of the major changes that the v1.0 API brings.Our smart contractFor our example, let\u2019s use a simple increment/decrement counter with the following smart contract:pragma solidity ^0.4.24;contract Counter {  int count = 0;function increment() public {    count++;  }function decrement() public {    count--;  }function get() public view returns (int) {    return count;  }}Pretty basic, nothing too special about it. Now let\u2019s get into our Truffle tests.Our testsThis is what our test would look like if we followed the official Truffle documentation:This should also be pretty straight forward. We simply check that the initial value is 0, and that it can increment and decrement.Now let\u2019s see what it would look like with v1.0.It\u2019s largely the same, but there are two important differences:We use helpers from helpers.js (a file that we will create soon) so that we get access to the new Web3.js and its contract instance API.There is a new API for calling the smart contract methods.The helpersFirst, make sure you have a package.json file in your project. If not, simply run:npm init -yAnd then install the v1.0 version of web3:npm install web3Once we have that, create helpers.js in the same folder, then put the following into the file:For getWeb3, Since Truffle automagically injects the v0.20.x web3 into the global scope, we wrap it with our own v1.0 web3 and return the new one.For getContractInstance, because we want to make it a reusable function, we first take in the new web3, and then return a function that can create contract instances simply by passing in the contract name. So you can use it like this:// v1.0const web3 = getWeb3()const getInstance = getContractInstance(web3)const myContract = getInstance(\"MyContractName\")myContract.methods.myMethodName().call()Note that calling getInstance in the above example basically replaces the old way of getting a contract instance:// v0.20.xconst MyContract = artifacts.require(\"MyContractName\")const myContract = await MyContract.deployed()myContract.myMethodName.call()The new smart contract method APICalling smart contract methods are now namespaced under methods of the contract instance object. The new API looks something like this, depending on whether you are calling a constant function or a mutating one (i.e. read vs write):instance.methods.myMethod().call()instance.methods.myMethod().send({ from: \"0x...\" })Notice that the arguments for your smart contract method is now separated from the transaction-specific options (e.g. from and gas options). This allows you to build up your method call before actually sending it.Previously, the final function call would contain all the arguments of the methods, with the final argument at the end being your transaction options.// Oldinstance.myMethod(123, true, { from: \"0x...\" })// Newinstance.methods.myMethod(123, true).send({ from: \"0x...\" })// Also newconst doTheThing = instance.methods.myMethod(123, true)doTheThing.send({ from: \"0x...\" })  // execute it laterPromiEventsOne of the most convenient things with the new API is that contract methods now return a PromiEvent, which is a hybrid of a conventional Promise and an event emitter.That means you can attach numerous event handlers for the lifecycle of the transaction. But since it\u2019s also just a regular Promise, you can use await or .then() to do some work after the transaction has been mined. This provides a lot more flexibility for a better user experience.The following example is from the docs:web3.eth.sendTransaction({from: '0x123...', data: '0x432...'}).once('transactionHash', function(hash){ ... }).once('receipt', function(receipt){ ... }).on('confirmation', function(confNumber, receipt){ ... }).on('error', function(error){ ... }).then(function(receipt){    // will be fired once the receipt its mined});This would mean we can do something like this:const doSomething = instance.methods.myMethod(123, true)await doSomething.send({ from: \"0x...\" })  .once('transactionHash', (hash) => {     // notify user of the tx hash with an etherscan link  })  .on('confirmation', (confNumber) => {    // update UI to show the number of confirmations for this tx  })// the transaction has been mined, execute other code here!First, we created our method call and assigned it to doSomething. And then when we wanted to execute the transaction, we called .send() on it and passed in our transaction options.From there, we immediately let the user know the transaction hash and give them a link to the relevant Etherscan page. Once the transaction has been mined, the code will resume execution below.As an added bonus, we are also able to show the number of confirmations onto the UI if we wanted to.Try it outIt\u2019s my hope that the Truffle team can incorporate some of these ideas soon. It would be great to see more support for Web3.js v1.0. There\u2019s a severe lack of up-to-date and well-maintained Javascript libraries for working with Ethereum and I think this is the best way forward.In the mean time, I hope this article has helped you to better understand how to work with the new version of Web3.js.If you felt that this was helpful, please leave me a few claps and share!", "responses": 1, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Development", "Smart Contracts", "Solidity", "Blockchain"]}, {"title": "Executing and Accessing Smart Contract Without Truffle", "post_link": "https://medium.com/coinmonks/executing-and-accessing-smart-contract-without-truffle-415f1e647d66?source=search_post", "author_name": "Niharika Singh", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@Niharika3297", "publish_date": "2019-01-04", "last_modified_date": "2019-01-04", "readtime": "4.08", "claps": 537, "voters": 24, "content": "Executing and Accessing Smart Contract Without TruffleNiharika SinghFollowJan 4 \u00b7 5 min readI know that Truffle has become a standard to work around with smart contracts but practicing everything fundamentally and transparently is what makes everything more lucid.In this tutorial, we will write a simple smart contract in Solidity and make calls to it directly via Web3.

In this step, we are writing the smart contract to the blockchain.This will give us a transaction hash, and you can view this transaction on Ganache on \u2018Transactions\u2019 tab.Step 4.10: Create an instance to use the contract> app = addContract.at(addDeployed.address)addDeployed.address is the address on the blockchain where the contract is deployed.Step 4.11: Let\u2019s add 4 and 8 using our contract.> app.Sum(4, 8, {from: web3.eth.accounts[0]})Since this Sum function writes to the blockchain, we have to pay some gas which is paid by the first account in Ganache since we used accounts[0].Contract call is visible on Ganache.To get the sum, let\u2019s invoke the getSum function.Since JavaScript is unable to read uint256, we convert the result toString() .Since getSum function does not write anything to the blockchain, it will not result into any transaction.So this is how we use the JavaScript console to interact with the smart contract.I hope you found this informational.

Each block typically contains a hash pointer as a link to a previous block, a timestamp and transaction data. It enables digital currency named Bitcoin and Ethereum.Bitcoin is a digital asset designed by its inventor, Satoshi Nakamoto, to work as a currency.Ethereum is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts on a custom built Blockchain. It provides a cryptocurrency token called \u201cether\u201d and enables the decentralized web3.web3 is a platform for decentralized apps (dApps).dApps is a Decentralized Applications on web3 which connect Frontend with Smart Contract on Blockchain.MetaMask is a dApps browsers as Chrome extension. Allows you to run Ethereum dApps right in your browser without running a full Ethereum node.DAO : Decentralized Autonomous OrganizationDevelopersweb3.js is the Ethereum compatible JavaScript API which implements the Generic JSON RPC spec. It\u2019s available on npm as a node moduleTruffle is a NodeJS Framework for Ethereum, use for compile, deploy smart contract.Solidity is a contract-oriented, high-level language whose syntax is similar to that of JavaScript and it is designed to target the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).ABI : Application Binary Interface, is basically how you call functions in a contract and get data back.IPC : Inter-process Communications, the mechanisms an operating system provides to allow the processes to manage shared data.RPC : Remote Procedure Calls, a kind of request\u2013response protocolExamplesSetup : https://github.com/katopz/ethereum-dockerSimple : https://github.com/katopz/truffle-simple-storage-exampleAdvance : https://github.com/katopz/truffle-metacoin-exampleCRUD : https://github.com/katopz/ethereum-todolistWeb3 : https://github.com/katopz/web3-react-exampleGraphQL : https://github.com/katopz/ethereum-to-graphqlSorry that I just throw you all examples at once but you won\u2019t find working examples anywhere because Truffle 4 is just release and because of truffle develop, and bare truffle init (without MetaCoin example) will break anything you know from Truffle 3 already.

Truffle Teams Will Change Enterprise Blockchain DevelopmentAn Interview with Mike Seese\u2013Technical Lead for Truffle Teams\u2013about the TruffleTeams features, blockchain development, and more!ConsenSysFollowJun 13 \u00b7 7 min readTruffle produces the \u201cSweetest Tools for Smart Contracts\u201d and has been building out their new product Truffle Teams. We caught up with Mike Seese, the Technical Lead for Truffle Teams to talk about Truffle\u2019s new product Truffle Teams.The Chocolatier Behind Truffle Teams: Mike SeeseMike is nothing shy of exceptional, with two bachelor\u2019s degrees in Computer Hardware Engineering and Electrical Engineering, as well as a Masters in Electrical and Computer Engineering. Mike has previously worked as a Systems Engineer for Lockheed Martin and as a Software Engineer at multiple startups. Eventually, he became a software engineer at Truffle, the infamous smart contracts tool that has nearly 3 million downloads over it\u2019s three main products. Now Mike is the Technical Lead for Truffle Teams, the newest blockchain development tool.Get your Ticket for TruffleCon 2019 TodayNow, onto the interview!Before we get into Truffle Teams, the most important question of all, what is your favorite chocolate?Basically, anything that has milk chocolate and caramel. Milky Ways are by far my favorite.What is Truffle Teams?Zero Configuration Continuous Integration for Smart Contracts. Or Zero Config CI for short.Okay but really what is it?Explain it Like I\u2019m Not a Developer: Truffle Teams?Truffle Teams streamlines a team\u2019s workflow, giving them a shared compilation and testing environment for continuous integration. Truffle Teams enables a team to monitor deployed smart contracts\u2019 transaction, state, and events. It also enables for visual presentation of useful data and configurable notifications of errors provide critical insight for the team.CTA: Sign up for updates to be notified when Truffle Team premium is readyWhy Does The Enterprise World Need Truffle Teams?Continuous integration (CI) is very common within the software development world. Many developers use Travis CI or AppVeyor CI. Developers need to setup configuration files to instruct these platforms on which dependencies to install and what commands/scripts to execute to then compile and run tests. Truffle Teams CI does all of this configuration for developers so that they can spend time doing the fun stuff.Setting up a Travis CI can be tedious work that requires developers to ensure the config file has all the necessary packages or fixing anything that may have gone wrong. And in the software development world, things never go wrong. Continuous integration requires important, yet dare we say, boring steps that can result in bugs, headaches, and lost time. That\u2019s why with Truffle Teams we\u2019re trying to make sure the developer can get up and running as quickly as possible.What does the Truffle Teams free version provide for developers?Truffle is guided on the philosophy to create open source tools for developers. Truffle teams will always provide a free version which enables automated smart contract compilation and testing. Additionally, users get unlimited open source repositories that seamlessly integrate with Github and provide an easy view of your repository history.What is the key benefit of Truffle Teams?The key benefit of Truffle Teams is the ability to enable a team, no matter the size, to view where your project is going during the enter product life cycle. From the development perspective, teams can watch where things are failing and succeeding to respond accordingly. From the operations side, teams are monitoring what\u2019s been deployed and how people are interacting with your contracts with as little configuration as possible.What are the Truffle Teams premium features and how will they enhance enterprise blockchain development?There are currently three premium features. Let\u2019s go through each of them and talk about what they mean in a real-world situation.1. Monitor deployed smart contracts\u2019 transactions, state, and events.Having successful builds is great, but teams need the ability to understand more information about their smart contracts.Are people misusing the contracts or calling the wrong function? Maybe transactions are failing or there is a bug somewhere. Truffle Teams is able to monitor an organization\u2019s contracts and display a dashboard for developers to monitor the state of their contracts, transactions, and events. Teams would have the power to easily view the balance or users of a specific contract.Currently, developers have to get information from Etherscan or build their own interface to execute. Even worse is that this has to be conducted for each individual contract whereas Truffle Teams enables teams to evaluate multiple contracts simultaneously.Furthermore, Truffle Teams integrates with other Truffle suite products. Therefore, Truffle would know an Enterprise\u2019s entire truffle project and collect metrics to identify why contracts are failing.Truffle Teams enables project level vs contract level monitoring which becomes increasingly important at the enterprise level.2. Configurable notifications for errors and anomalies such as failed transactions or balance changes.Everybody loves notifications. It\u2019s not enough to know a problem exists if someone can\u2019t respond to the issue in time. Truffle Teams dashboards can be customized to notify a developer that the balance of a contract is decreasing more rapidly than normal. Additionally, Truffle Teams can monitor exploitations and provide proper updates. Notifications will be able to be configured so that an email could be sent to the responsible party if a contract experiences 20% transactions failure. Truffle Teams will bring information to developers so that they can make timely decisions for their projects.3. Visualize monitoring data your way using tables and graphs.Truffle Teams will come with a developer operations dashboard that can monitor bandwidth and CPU usage. Imagine a situation where gas fees spike for a specific smart contract. Visualizing contract data, a developer could easily optimize the contract to save users\u2019 or the firm\u2019s network fees or increase the gas price to ensure that transactions get through quickly.What\u2019s in store for Truffle Teams?Companies develop features for their users. Twitter created the retweet button after users started retweeting each other\u2019s tweets. Facebook groups were initially created by users before becoming a major feature. While our team has many features in line for Truffle Teams, ultimately we believe in creating features that the community finds most valuable. So let us know your thoughts, we value your ideas! A few features we are planning are real-time smart contract analytics and monitoring\u200b, Azure Pipelines integration for advanced project CI\u200b, team-wide development and staging blockchains with a single click\u200b, smart contract continuous delivery and build promotion\u200b and more! Stay tuned for more details and sign up for our email updates.How does Truffle Teams push overall blockchain development forward?Truffle Teams is a huge opportunity for blockchain development and applications to move into the modern world of software development. Over the last couple of decades, so many tools have been developed to bring software to the enterprise world. Blockchain is quickly catching up; however, blockchain becomes difficult with this distributed ledger where things are harder to monitor. While there\u2019s one global place for data on something like Ethereum, ledger integration for Quorum or other enterprise ledgers is more difficult. Truffle teams gives enterprises this glimpse into the future of what product development life cycle tools will look like for the blockchain ecosystem.What most excites you about the blockchain ecosystem?We\u2019ve been saying how blockchain is growing exponentially and how it\u2019s getting closer and closer to going mainstream. Even though we\u2019ve had this bear market, it has not hindered the developer ecosystem. Everyone is still pushing forward. The tools, infrastructure, developers are all starting to merge into this revolution.Is there a team size limit for Truffle Teams?Truffle Teams is built for teams of all sizes, from the single developer to the large scale enterprise teams that have various roles. Truffle Teams enables managers to have a default dashboard of contract balances and graphs as well as the ability to create more specific dashboards for individual developers.TruffleCon is coming up in August, what do you say to people who want to go?If you thought last year was going to be great, Microsoft is hosting this year and it\u2019s going to be bigger and better than ever.Get your Ticket for TruffleCon 2019 TodayDisclaimer.

A DApp is a software application where the backend code is run on a decentralized and distributed blockchain such as Ethereum, as opposed to a centralized server.Building on the prior OpenLaw tutorial by Michael Rice, we will demonstrate a full end-to-end tutorial on how create a simple DApp integrated with the OpenLaw JavaScript API and Truffle\u2019s React Box. Building a DApp with OpenLaw requires both the OpenLaw APIClient and OpenLaw Object libraries which come bundled in the OpenLaw NPM package.While this tutorial covers deploying a smart contract in Truffle using React as the front-end, it is not necessary to use Truffle or React with OpenLaw. These tools are just one way to get from end-to-end to build your DApp and have it powered by OpenLaw. So, if you already have a smart contract deployed and want to skip the section about deploying a contract with Truffle, please feel free to do so.Prerequisites: Basic knowledge of JavaScript and NPM/Node.js. Working knowledge of React and the Truffle framework is helpful for this particular tutorial, but not necessary to use the OpenLaw API and OpenLaw Object in general.Already Installed on your computer (to do this tutorial in its entirety, make sure you have all of the below). Node version 8.9.4, NPM version 6.0.0, Truffle version 5.0.3 . For this tutorial, we are using a globally installed version of Truffle. If you haven\u2019t installed Truffle, See the Truffle docs and Truffle NPM package. Also needed are MetaMask in your browser. Rinkeby Ether in your MetaMask account and an Infura.io account to connect your DApp to the Rinkeby testnet.Skip Ahead:If you want to skip straight to the code go to the Github here.If you want to skip the deploying a contract with Truffle section, and go straight to building with the OpenLaw API in your App.js click here.What we are building: \u2014 A DApp to interact with the OpenLaw APIOverviewFor this tutorial, we are going to 1) create an OpenLaw template with OpenLaw\u2019s easy to use markdown language, 2) use Truffle\u2019s React Box to deploy a smart contract to accompany our OpenLaw template, 3) and finally use the OpenLaw JavaScript API to build a microsite with React.js to interact with our OpenLaw template.Setup OpenLawSign-up for OpenLaw account. If you do not already have an OpenLaw account, you can sign up for a free account.OpenLaw Documentation. We will primarily be referencing the documentation from the OpenLaw APIClient and the OpenLaw Object both of which are packaged with OpenLaw\u2019s NPM module.OpenLaw APIClient DocumentationOpenLaw Object DocumentationCreate an OpenLaw Template. Log in to the Openlaw.io instance you are using and create a template, for this demo I will use the title \u201cOpenLaw API Tutorial Sale Agreement\u201d, but you can call your agreement whatever you like. Then cut and paste the code below (For a full explanation of how to build this template, please see OpenLaw\u2019s previous tutorial). The previous tutorial explains how to create a \u201cBill of Sale\u201d Template, which is a simple blockchain based legal agreement where one party agrees to buy an item at a certain price from another party.<%[[Seller Address: EthAddress]][[Buyer Address: EthAddress]][[Purchased Item]][[Purchase Price: Number]][[@Purchase Price in Wei = Purchase Price * 1000000000000000000]][[Record Contract:EthereumCall(contract: \"0x9570a3C2e9cC4a43D03d06EC9bf36fa5B9bCd0D2\";interface:[{\"constant\":false,\"inputs\":[{\"name\":\"_descr\",\"type\":\"string\"},{\"name\":\"_price\",\"type\":\"uint256\"},{\"name\":\"_seller\",\"type\":\"address\"},{\"name\":\"_buyer\",\"type\":\"address\"}],\"name\":\"recordContract\",\"outputs\":[],\"payable\":false,\"stateMutability\":\"nonpayable\",\"type\":\"function\"}];network:\"Rinkeby\";function:\"recordContract\";arguments: Purchased Item, Purchase Price in Wei, Seller Address, Buyer Address)]]%>\\centered ** BILL OF SALE **Seller at Ethereum address [[Seller Address]] (\"Seller\") agrees to sell a **[[Purchased Item]]**, and buyer at Ethereum address [[Buyer Address]]  (\"Buyer\") agrees to pay [[Purchase Price]] ether located at the contract address \"Insert your contract address\".[[Record Contract]]SELLER:[[Seller Signatory Email: Identity | Signature]]________________BUYER:[[Buyer Signatory Email: Identity | Signature]]Set up with Truffle\u2019s React Box, Add CSS, and Deploy a Smart Contract.See: the Truffle React Box docs. As noted before, it is not necessary to use Truffle and/or React.js to with the OpenLaw API.Start a new DApp with Truffle\u2019s React Box from the terminal:mkdir openlaw-api-tutorialcd openlaw-api-tutorialtruffle unbox reactIn the root directory install the dotenv and truffle-hdwallet NPM packages:npm install dotenvnpm install truffle-hdwallet-provider@web3-oneFrom the root directory install the OpenLaw NPM package (at the time of writing this is version 0.1.20) in the client folder:cd clientnpm install openlaw --saveAdd a .env and a truffle.js file to your root directory. The root directory should look like this:Root directory with .env and truffle.js added.Add the CSS. From the root directory add Semantic-UI and Semantic-UI-React for CSS. You can also use your preferred CSS framework.cd client npm i semantic-uinpm i semantic-ui-reactNote: if prompted in the terminal, install semantic-ui in default folders.From the root directory go to your index.html filecd client/public/index.htmland add the link to the Semantic-UI stylesheet inside <head></head><link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/semanticui@2.4.2/dist/semantic.min.css/>Deploying the BillOfSale.sol contract with Truffle.You will need a free Infura.io account for this part of the tutorial. Infura.ioprovides free access to an Ethereum node, which means you do not have to download the entire Ethereum blockchain to start developing. Sign up for free, login, go to the \u201cDashboard\u201d, create a new project, after you create a new project, use the \u201cProject Id\u201d for your Infura API key.Infura DashboardIn the .env file create a MNEMONIC and INFURA_API_KEY variable. It should be your own mnemoic and Infura API Key (Note: do not put quotes around the mnemonic).inside the .env file in our root directoryIn the truffle.js file, cut and paste the following code to connect to the Rinkeby network (For a more in-depth discussion about configuring a network in truffle with Infura, click here):require('dotenv').config();var HDWalletProvider = require(\"truffle-hdwallet-provider\");var mnemonic = process.env[\"MNEMONIC\"];var infuraKey = process.env[\"INFURA_API_KEY\"];module.exports = {  // See <http://truffleframework.com/docs/advanced/configuration>  // to customize your Truffle configuration!  //https://truffleframework.com/docs/truffle/getting-started/truffle-with-metamask  //add solc optimizer    solc: {    optimizer: {      enabled: true,      runs: 2000    }  },   //default -- contracts_build_directory:\"./build/contracts\", // contracts_build_directory:\"./client/src/contracts\",  networks: {    ganache: {      host: \"localhost\",      port: 8545,      network_id: \"*\" // match any network    },    rinkeby: {      //wrap provider in function to avoid crashing      provider: function() {        return new HDWalletProvider(mnemonic, \"https://rinkeby.infura.io/v3/\" + infuraKey);      },      host: \"localhost\",      //port: 8545,      network_id: 4, //rinkeby test network      gas:  4000000, // Gas limit used for deploys      gasPrice : 1000000000    }  }};In the ./contracts folder delete the default SimpleStorage.sol file and replace with BillOfSale.sol and cut and paste the code in:pragma solidity ^0.5.0;contract BillOfSale {  address payable public seller;  address public buyer;  string public descr;  uint public price;  bool public confirmed;  //from OpenLaw Template  function recordContract(string memory _descr, uint _price,    address payable _seller, address _buyer  ) public {    descr = _descr;    price = _price;    seller = _seller;     buyer = _buyer;  }function () external payable { }function confirmReceipt() public payable {    require(msg.sender == buyer, \"only buyer can confirm\");    require(address(this).balance == price, \"purchase price must be funded\");    address(seller).transfer(address(this).balance);    confirmed = true;  }}In the ./migrations folder delete the code inside \u201c2_deploy_contracts.js\u201drelated to SimpleStorage and cut and paste this code:var BillOfSale = artifacts.require(\"./BillOfSale.sol\");module.exports = function(deployer) {  deployer.deploy(BillOfSale);};Compile and migrate our BillOfSale contract to the Rinkeby testnet. Go into the terminal and into the root directory of our DApp and run:rm -r build/this command will clear the ./build folder, and is good to use whenever the solidity files are changed.From the root directory, compile and deploy our BillOfSale contract to the Rinkeby testnet:truffle compiletruffle migrate --reset --network rinkebyIf your migration to Rinkeby was successful it should look like this:Successful deployment to RinkebySave your contract address (I highlighted mine in blue for example).Using the OpenLaw JavaScript APIAdd the address of your deployed smart contract into your OpenLaw API Tutorial Sale Agreement (highlighted in blue)Open a second terminal window and from the root directory go to your client folder and run the DApp on http://localhost:3000/ in your browser. (Note:until we change our App.js file error will render in the browser, which we will get to in a moment).cd clientnpm run startThen go to client/src/App.js . This is where we will be importing our OpenLaw API Client and OpenLaw Object from the NPM module. We will be doing the bulk of our coding in App.js.Import the following into App.js:import React, { Component } from \"react\";import BillOfSaleContract from \"./contracts/BillOfSale.json\";import getWeb3 from \"./utils/getWeb3\";import { Container,Grid, Button, Form} from 'semantic-ui-react';import { APIClient, Openlaw } from 'openlaw';import \"./App.css\";Note: Issue with Truffle with Create-React-App. (If you open the JavaScript console in your browser, and see that you are unable to import the BillOfSaleContract into App.js, then it may be an issue with Create-React-App part of Truffle\u2019s React Box. This can be fixed by linking or copying the ./contracts folder from the ./build folder into ./src, see the below screenshot. )Order of Operations for App.jsConfigure the OpenLaw API constants and access our OpenLaw instance and current template of OpenLaw Tutorial Sale Agreement.Set the state variables.Capture the User\u2019s input from the Form.Build the OpenLaw object parametersSend the OpenLaw object to the OpenLaw instance and have it appear in the \u201cDraft Management\u201d or \u201cContract Management\u201d tab.Below is a description of all the variables and functions we will be using to integrate OpenLaw into our App.js file.

It\u2019s a tool that makes developing Ethereum projects much easier. When people first interact with Truffle, they think they\u2019re confined to fitting into the structure first provided, having a very rare scope that supports only specific types of projects. I\u2019m here to dispel that myth \u2014 and many others \u2014 and show you some Truffle tricks you didn\u2019t know were possible.Myth #1: You must use the folders provided to you in the `app` directoryWhen you run `truffle init` and you\u2019re given an app directory with \u201cjavascripts\u201d, \u201cstylesheets\u201d and \u201cimages\u201d within it, you might think you have to use those directories to take advantage of Truffle\u2019s build process. You don\u2019t. You can delete those folders, add new ones, or rename them to your heart\u2019s content. Here\u2019s an example build configuration where files have been renamed (notice no images directory):Directory structure:/app \u2014 pages \u2014 controls \u2014 vendorApp configuration:{  \u201cbuild\u201d: {    \"app.js\": [      \"vendor/react.js\",       // structure is up to you      \"controls/button.js\",      \"pages/page_one.jsx\",       \"pages/page_two.jsx\"     ]  },  // ...}Myth #2: Dependencies must live in the app directoryPaths are relative to the app directory, but that doesn\u2019t mean dependencies have to live there. Here\u2019s an example where the build process refers to dependencies that exist outside of \u201capp\u201d, allowing you to take advantage of package managers like npm:{  \u201cbuild\u201d: {    \"app.js\": [      \"../node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js\",      // ...    ]  },  // ...}Myth #3: Truffle can only build web appsFalse. Here\u2019s a great example of Truffle building a library, creating both a distributable and minified version.Myth #4: Truffle can\u2019t have multiple dependent build targetsOh but it can. Taken from the same example as Myth #3, you can use build targets as they\u2019re created, since each build target within app.json is created in order:{  \u201cbuild\u201d: {     // The main library file.     \u201chooked-web3-provider.js\u201d: \u201chooked-web3-provider.es6\u201d,// Note, the first one will be processed before this one,     // so we can refer to the built file.     \u201chooked-web3-provider.min.js\u201d: {       \u201cfiles\u201d: [         \u201c../build/hooked-web3-provider.js\u201d       ],       \u201cpost-process\u201d: [         \u201cuglify\u201d       ]     }  },  // ...}Myth #5: Like it or not, you must use Truffle\u2019s build processNope \u2014 this is perhaps the biggest myth. Just delete the \u201cbuild\u201d configuration from your app.json if you need something more complex (or don\u2019t want a build process at all). You can still use Truffle for contract compilation, testing and deployment.Myth #6: Contract code requires lots of copy pastaThis isn\u2019t so much a myth it is a lesser-known feature we added to Truffle. Solidity\u2019s import statement leaves much to be desired, so we wrote our own. If you want to include one contract as a dependency of another, simply import it in the order you want it included; Truffle will take care of the rest.import \"Permissioned\"; // Looks for ./contracts/Permissioned.solcontract MyContract is Permissioned {  // ..}You can even import nested contract files:import \"tools/Hammer\"; // Looks for ./contracts/tools/Hammer.solAnd viola! Mangeable, maintainable code separation, sans pasta.Myth #7: Truffle doesn\u2019t support different blockchains like development vs. staging vs. production, or a testnet vs. Olympic vs. Frontier)Au contraire. Truffle has the concept of environments \u2014 pulled from Rails \u2014 that you can use to configure different blockchains and contracts deployed to those blockchains. By default you\u2019re given development, staging, productionand test, but they\u2019re not required. If you don\u2019t need one, just delete it andTruffle will respond accordingly. If you want to make your environments more tailored to you, then rename them. Here\u2019s an example file structure with environment names tailored to the context the app will be deployed to:Directory structure:/config \u2014 development \u2014 consensys-testnet \u2014 ethereum-mainnet - app.jsonEach of the directories within `config` should contain a `config.json` file that at minimum defines the network they connect to. You can also use this config file to overwrite the default configuration of any value within `app.json`:{  \"rpc\": {    \"host\": \"xx.xx.xx.xx\",     \"port\": \"1234\"  }}Once in place, you can build your application as well as compile and deploy your contracts to use the environments you\u2019ve specified:// Both compile and deploy will write a contracts.json file to the// environment specified:$ truffle compile -e consensys-testnet $ truffle deploy -e consensys-testnet// Building will hook up the contracts in the specified environment// to the frontend for use. If you keep the production environment,// `truffle dist` will create a `dist` folder you can commit to// your respository.$ truffle build -e consensys-testnet$ truffle distMyth #8: Truffle doesn\u2019t support complex deployment processesTruffle hasn\u2019t taken a stance on the ideal contract deployment process, so you won\u2019t see any advanced deployment options if you take a deep dive into the code. But complex deployment processes are possible, and can easily be scripted with `truffle exec`. Truffle\u2019s `exec` command lets you run a Node script within the environment you specify (details below), interacting with your contracts the same way you would when writing your frontend or your tests.Here\u2019s an example script that can be run after `truffle deploy` that hooks up an AppStore contract with an AppFactory:File Name: register_factories.js-----------------------------------------------------var store = AppStore.at(AppStore.deployed_address);store.registerFactory(\u201capp\u201d, AppFactory.deployed_address).then(function(tx) {  console.log(\u201cRegistered AppFactory successfully.\u201d);  process.exit(0)}).catch(function(e) {  console.log(e);  process.exit(1);});To run this script, simply run the following. In this example, `truffle exec` will use the contracts that were already deployed to the \u201cconsensys-testnet\u201d environment created above:$ truffle exec ./register_factories.js -e consensys-testnetFin.Truffle is still being actively developed, and has a ways to go before it solves all development and deployment problems in the young Ethereum Frontier. However, through the tricks above we hope you can get one step closer to a manageable, maintainable project.

Nowadays the truffles are becoming even more popular, and many of us may try to make something gourmet or a fancy masterpiece using this highly priced and sensitive ingredient. There are lots of products infused with the scent of the truffles for many to enjoy as well, such as truffle zest, truffle salt, truffle oil, even truffle honey. And since the truffles are becoming more and more popular, the prices of the truffles are rising, even some products with low contents of truffles are at prices higher than you may think.As the demand for truffles rises, the demand for truffle related food products and general demand for fresher and higher quality food products have been rising as well. Using QR codes (attached on the container/boxes of the food products) linked to blockchain, can help us achieve this goal of getting more of the fresh and quality food products and increase trust between the consumers and the manufacturers.Using our mobile devices, tablets, and small laptops, we can scan a QR code to find out about a specific manufacturer\u2019s information, supply chain information and details about the product quickly on the blockchain database. One example that we can use to explain this is how the truffle salt can be delivered at our doorsteps or to a local grocery store. And this may help us understand how blockchain technology benefits us as consumers when we are purchasing highly sensitive food products. So before thinking about purchasing anything with truffles at all, we can take a closer look at the journey of truffle salt and see how blockchain technology can help us receive the most fresh and trustworthy products from a manufacturer.\uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ucd9c\ucc98 : \ub9c8\ucf13\uceec\ub9acFirst of all, we have to think about where to purchase the truffle salt. It can be purchased online, at shopping malls or at fine dine restaurants. Although purchasing the salt from any of the three sellers can be fine, but purchasing it through online can be more convenient and reasonable, so let\u2019s take a look at one example of purchasing the truffle salt through an online supplier. In a case of purchasing the truffle salt online, we can purchase it from the internet shopping malls or we can buy it directly from a manufacturer. If we decide to purchase it directly from a manufacturer, we can expect it to be at a lower price, but we may have to consider the quality of the product and/or possible care damage during the delivery process; thinking that it may not be so easy purchasing it directly from a manufacturer or a large distributor online or even a local grocery store, not knowing much about their delivery process.Now that we know some things to consider when we are purchasing a product directly from a manufacturer or a large distributor, we have to question the quality and freshness of it. However, what if we can check the quality of the truffle salt by checking the circulation process using blockchain technology and its database? By obtaining the QR code at the beginning of the transaction or as it is displayed next to the product on the online page, we can use this QR code to get more detailed information about the product directly from the manufacturer before we purchase it. Also, if the QR code of the product we received from online (prior to receiving the actual code on the container) is different than the QR code on the product we\u2019ve received, we can use the QR codes as evidence to receive reimbursement. In this way, we can keep the QR codes as evidence for the company\u2019s mistakes, and the company can become more aware not to make the same mistakes and ensure that they don\u2019t lose more capital by giving out a lot of refunds.Moreover, if we utilize the QR code, we can check more diverse and accurate information about the product other than just the circulation process. First of all, we can find out more about the manufacturer of the truffle salt. Since it is a sensitive food product, we can check its manufacturing process, whether or not the manufacturer used the proper sanitary procedure, known for featuring quality products, use pesticides or not, and if it is organic or not. We can also check if the manufacturer has the certification on all of its products, check when it was made and the production date as well. After the production, we can also check the temperature, humidity, and if contaminants were found until it gets transferred out for delivery.After checking the manufacturer\u2019s information, we can check whether the product was transported correctly as well. We can check whether it was transported through the air, sea, or ground transportation, and how the product was kept during the delivery process. Using the information from IoT sensors, we can check whether there was any damage occurred on the product during the circulation process.TEMCO\u2019s smart-taggingWe can also get the information about the distributors or the re-distributors during the circulation process using the QR code. Where the product was stationed, the location of the distributor, company information, receiving date and send out date, and the length of time it was preserved. In addition, since the truffle salt is a sensitive product, we can check how it was preserved or stored in the distribution center, using the QR code system again, checking the blockchain database.Until the truffle salt is delivered to us, all the information is open for viewing in the blockchain database. Through the blockchain technology and its database, consumers can purchase safer products, with more trust, since the blockchain database can easily uphold information from the manufacturing process to final delivery, we can trust the quality of it and find out if anything happened to the product that caused it to reduce its quality during the circulation and the delivery process. On the manufacturers\u2019 point of view, finding out where the mishandling of the product happened and the problems causing lowering the quality of the product, early on by checking the blockchain database, they can save time and money, by preventing any mishandling beforehand; using this preventive technology, the manufacturers can retain their brand image and perhaps increase their sales. Using the blockchain, the manufacturers and the distributors can self-monitor their handling of products, quickly prevent and react to the mishaps, efficiently reducing the cost of operation.Now that we know some benefits of using the blockchain, what else can we think of? Instead of looking into just the one-way process, going from a manufacturer to a consumer, perhaps we can find out about the effect of blockchain technology in the integrated circulating logistics process, on manufacturers, distributors, and consumers, on the next page.\u201cTEMCO, Supply Chain Management Powered by Blockchain\u201d\u25b6 Homepage : http://temco.io\u25b7 Twitter : https://twitter.com/TEMCOLABS\u25b6 Facebook : https://www.facebook.com/TEMCOLABS\u25b7 Brunch : https://brunch.co.kr/@temcolabs\u25b6 Steemit : https://steemit.com/@temcolabs", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Qr Code", "Blockchain", "ICO", "Cryptocurrency", "Temco"]}, {"title": "Don\u2019t Steal Our Skinny Jeans", "post_link": "https://medium.com/bigger-picture/dont-steal-our-skinny-jeans-why-the-extreme-right-doesn-t-deserve-truffle-oil-cf0918b1cc1f?source=search_post", "author_name": "Rachel Khona", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@RachelKhona", "publish_date": "2018-06-26", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-27", "readtime": "4.07", "claps": 187, "voters": 15, "content": "Don\u2019t Steal Our Skinny JeansWhy the extreme right doesn\u2019t deserve truffle oilRachel KhonaFollowJun 26, 2018 \u00b7 5 min readOver the weekend in my home state of New Jersey, an anti-gay pastor made his way to the very LGBTQ-friendly Asbury Park to participate in the Festival of Life, an evangelical event. This butthole has called homosexuality \u201cevil\u201d and blamed Robin Williams\u2019 suicide on not having Jesus in his heart.When I heard of this nonsense, I decided I had to Google this dimwit. And what I found was truly appalling.He looked like a Brooklyn hipster.A plaid shirt-, skinny jean-, aviator sunglass-wearing fucking hipster. His haircut was that of a bass player in an indie band you may find at Coachella. Shaved on the sides and long on the top, like he went to an old-timey barber instead of a hair salon.I felt an anger rise in me I hadn\u2019t felt since I lost at Scrabble. This was my breaking point. I had come to almost accept the nonstop bullshittery in this divisive climate. But skinny jeans? I draw the line there.If you\u2019re a nutjob with ass-backwards views, you don\u2019t get to mooch off the Hollywood elites, the liberals, the gays, and people who don\u2019t eat gluten and then bitch that we are responsible for the downfall of society. Whole Foods is our territory, damn it! Let me explain.1. FashionYou can\u2019t go two feet in the fashion industry without tripping over a homosexual man. Gay men are designing those dark wash skinny jeans you just can\u2019t live without. Gay men gave us the supermodels of the world that you jerked off to as a teenager. And hipsters are gay-friendly, so knocking off their look is just as bad. You can\u2019t hate on gays and hipsters and then co-opt a style you saw in the pages of Esquire. Or on the band Kings of Leon. If there were no gays, I would look like Lois from Family Guy with no style to speak of. It\u2019s a horror I can\u2019t even begin to imagine. Want to wear clothes that are gay- and style-free? Try a potato sack.2. FoodBetween Sarah Huckabee Sanders at the Red Hen and Kirstjen Nielsen at MXDC Cocina Mexicana, you would think there are no Waffle Houses left.[1] Gurl, there isn\u2019t going to be a farm-to-table when our planet goes up in smoke. So no, Sarah, you don\u2019t get to indulge in chanterelle and scape risotto! Or Trout Grenobloise! Farm-to-table is not for people who don\u2019t believe in climate change and would gleefully watch Scott Pruitt dismantle the EPA like a cheap IKEA cabinet. And newsflash, the vast majority of kitchen staff in any given restaurant in America is staffed by undocumented Hispanics. Sarah knows that, but I guess she just couldn\u2019t resist that cheese board. Look I would love to eat fifteen donuts and pretend there are no calories, but there are. Denying reality is not the look. Enjoying an evening out on the backs of people you don\u2019t want here is super lame.As for Kirstjen \u2014 who thought nothing of unwinding at Mexican restaurant, after a week of trying to separate said people (among other Hispanics) from their children \u2014 all I have to say is what the fuck is she smoking? Because whatever it is, I\u2019d like some so I too can be that delusional. That\u2019s like cheating on a boyfriend, punching him in the dick, and then asking if you can hop on it.Go eat a Hot Pocket for fuck\u2019s sake.3. EntertainmentSeth Rogen recently appeared on \u201cLate Night with Stephen Colbert\u201d to regale viewers with the tale of the time Paul Ryan wanted a photo with him. Paul Ryan, the (soon-to-be former) leader of a party that chastises coastal elites and Hollywood liberals more often than Donald Trump grabs pussies. And get this: Seth Rogen isn\u2019t even American. He\u2019s Canadian. Canadians are worse than American liberals with their socialized healthcare and handsome, articulate president.4. SportsAnd last but not least, if you are an orange-faced Oompa Loompa that tells black athletes they shouldn\u2019t kneel to protest police brutality, you can\u2019t be butt-hurt when NFL and NBA teams don\u2019t want to kick it with you and your weird hair at the White House.Lest you think I am shading the right, I am not. There are plenty of sane people on the right, including some who happen to be gay, Asian, black, or Hispanic. They are people you don\u2019t agree with who aren\u2019t fundamentally batshit crazy or bigoted \u2014 who don\u2019t think all Mexicans are rapists or that all gays are going to hell.You can believe whatever you want. But you can\u2019t have it both ways. You can\u2019t get hard over freshly made guacamole and then act like Mexicans are vermin. You can\u2019t hate gays and want to look like you were styled by one of the Queer Eye guys. And you can\u2019t hate on black people and be angry they don\u2019t want to meet you.It\u2019s become a culture war, and there are two sides. If you are going to mock and belittle people who believe in all that is farm-to-table, organic cotton, and Bloomingdales, you don\u2019t get to partake in our shit. You also don\u2019t get to complain about Roseanne being taken off the air when the president of ABC is a black woman, because fucking DUH.[2] We don\u2019t want to wear camo and go duck hunting (at least not unironically) or attend homophobic church services. Everyone knows liberals would rather go to brunch and drink mimosas on Sunday morning anyway. If you want to sit with us, you\u2019re going to have to stop acting like a bigoted jackass.[1] Not trying to shade Waffle Houses, but all I\u2019m going to say is I went once and my stomach was never the same. Or maybe I should say my intestines.[2] Roseanne\u2019s comments are offensive to anyone with half a brain, but expecting a black woman to be okay with that is even more absurd.", "responses": 3, "tags": ["LGBTQ", "Culture", "Politics", "Humor", "Observation"]}, {"title": "Announcing TruffleCon 2018", "post_link": "https://media.consensys.net/announcing-trufflecon-2018-b31b364de40c?source=search_post", "author_name": "ConsenSys", "author_link": "https://media.consensys.net/@ConsenSys", "publish_date": "2018-07-16", "last_modified_date": "2018-07-20", "readtime": "1.33", "claps": 85, "voters": 11, "content": "Announcing TruffleCon 2018ConsenSysFollowJul 16, 2018 \u00b7 2 min readAnnouncing the first annual TruffleCon event October 5th \u2014 7th 2018.

Multiple smart contract languages are at the bleeding edge of innovation in competition to become mainstream. In addition to the well-known \u201cSolidity\u201d, there are several experimental languages targeting Ethereum:Bamboo \u2014 A morphing smart contract language (Not actively developed)Vyper \u2014 New experimental pythonic programming language (Actively developed)LLL \u2014 Low-level Lisp-like Language (Not actively developed)Flint \u2014 New language under development with security features including asset types, state transition, and safe integers (Actively developed)Pyramid \u2014 A dialect of the Scheme programming language that targets the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). (Not actively developed)What is Vyper?Vyper is an experimental smart contract language. It aims for simplicity, human readability, and security. Also, Vyper\u2019s syntax resembles Python.\u201cVyper is a contract-oriented, pythonic programming language that targets the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)\u201dLanguage Goals of VyperSimplicity \u2014 Vyper focuses on simplicity and maximizes the chances of writing error-free code. Its compiler implementation also strives for simplicity.Security & Audibility \u2014 Building secure contract comes naturally, that's what Vyper aims for; the code should have a natural reading flow for any reader. That's why Vyper encourages building one-page smart contracts. Code readability provides for better code audibility.Vyper Vs. SolidityVyper\u2019s goals as a language are different than those of Solidity. To achieve simplicity, readability, and audibility, Vyper doesn\u2019t include some of Solidity\u2019s features such as Modifiers and Inheritance. In addition, Vyper also doesn\u2019t include:Function overloadingOperator overloading (Solidity also doesn't support it as of 17 Jan 2018)Recursive callingInfinite-length loopsInline assemblyBinary fixed pointVyper scarifies all of the above to achieve it's design goals. However, Vyper does provide some interesting features :Bounds and overflow checking: On array accesses as well as on arithmetic level, which improves performance and increases reliability and security.Support for signed integers and decimal fixed point numbersDecidability: It should be possible to compute a precise upper bound for the gas consumption of any function call.Strong typing: Including support for units (e.g. timestamp, timedelta, seconds, wei, wei per second, meters per second squared).Small and understandable compiler codeLimited support for pure functions: Anything marked constant is not allowed to change the state.Among the above, decidability is a very important feature which you can use to estimate your upper bound of gas usage. This can help in gas optimization, which is a very important part of a smart contract platform.Installing VyperLet\u2019s get to it and install Vyper now. If you are running MacOS, check instructions here (I am running Ubuntu 16.10).Note- Vyper is in active development, so don\u2019t lose patience if you get installation errors. \ud83d\ude03Install Pythonsudo apt-get updatesudo apt-get install python3.6sudo apt-get install python3-devCreate Virtual EnvironmentIf you have worked with Python before then you must know about Virtual Python environment. It is strongly recommended to install Vyper in a Virtual Python environment.To create a new virtual environment for Vyper run the following commands:sudo apt install virtualenvvirtualenv -p python3.6 --no-site-packages ~/vyper-venvsource ~/vyper-venv/bin/activateYou must still be in the Virtual environment\u2026 now let\u2019s install Vyper:git clone https://github.com/ethereum/vyper.gitcd vypermakemake testIf everything went fine, then first thank to Byte God \ud83d\ude03 and compile an example contract:vyper examples/crowdfund.vyThere are many examples in the example folder of the installation directory.

Let's test our smart contact on the same Truffle console:VyperStorage.deployed().then((token) => {contract = token;})contract.set(1)contract.get(0)Deploy To MainNet using QuikNodeNow let\u2019s deploy our smart contract on MainNet using our own QuikNode. First, we have to install HDWalletProvider to handle the transaction signing as well as the connection to the Ethereum network.$ npm install truffle-hdwallet-providerNext, in truffle.js we have to setup our wallet provider (using QuikNode Web3 URL):var HDWalletProvider = require(\"truffle-hdwallet-provider\");var mnemonic = \"YOUR_MEMONICS\"; // use a funded walletmodule.exports = {    networks: {        development: {            host: \"127.0.0.1\",            port: 7545,            network_id: \"*\" // Match any network id        },        kovan: {            provider: function() {                return new HDWalletProvider(mnemonic, \"https://mistakenly-smart-jay.quiknode.io/86d9e35e-8cdb-47ad-80a4-84f9e9537afa/C0_tKUunhUc0rM_i1HMxHA==/\")            },            network_id: 42        }    }};That\u2019s it, you ran and deployed your first Vyper smart contract using truffle!In future blogs, we will go more in-depth about the Vyper language and building more complex smart contracts.Awesome Vyper \ud83d\udc0dVyper is an experimental language but the community is quite active and building interesting tools (check the full list here).

Truffle gives us inbuilt development blockchain with ethereum accounts.Let\u2019s create a file with CrudApp.sol (Notice, same name as our contract name) under contracts directory and paste our smart contract code.Let\u2019s compile our smart contract using,truffle compileIt may show some warnings but let\u2019s ignore them for now. Open our development console using,truffle developIt will show an output something like below:Truffle Develop started at http://127.0.0.1:9545/Accounts:(0) 0x627306090abab3a6e1400e9345bc60c78a8bef57(1) 0xf17f52151ebef6c7334fad080c5704d77216b732(2) 0xc5fdf4076b8f3a5357c5e395ab970b5b54098fef(3) 0x821aea9a577a9b44299b9c15c88cf3087f3b5544(4) 0x0d1d4e623d10f9fba5db95830f7d3839406c6af2(5) 0x2932b7a2355d6fecc4b5c0b6bd44cc31df247a2e(6) 0x2191ef87e392377ec08e7c08eb105ef5448eced5(7) 0x0f4f2ac550a1b4e2280d04c21cea7ebd822934b5(8) 0x6330a553fc93768f612722bb8c2ec78ac90b3bbc(9) 0x5aeda56215b167893e80b4fe645ba6d5bab767dePrivate Keys:(0) c87509a1c067bbde78beb793e6fa76530b6382a4c0241e5e4a9ec0a0f44dc0d3(1) ae6ae8e5ccbfb04590405997ee2d52d2b330726137b875053c36d94e974d162f(2) 0dbbe8e4ae425a6d2687f1a7e3ba17bc98c673636790f1b8ad91193c05875ef1(3) c88b703fb08cbea894b6aeff5a544fb92e78a18e19814cd85da83b71f772aa6c(4) 388c684f0ba1ef5017716adb5d21a053ea8e90277d0868337519f97bede61418(5) 659cbb0e2411a44db63778987b1e22153c086a95eb6b18bdf89de078917abc63(6) 82d052c865f5763aad42add438569276c00d3d88a2d062d36b2bae914d58b8c8(7) aa3680d5d48a8283413f7a108367c7299ca73f553735860a87b08f39395618b7(8) 0f62d96d6675f32685bbdb8ac13cda7c23436f63efbb9d07700d8669ff12b7c4(9) 8d5366123cb560bb606379f90a0bfd4769eecc0557f1b362dcae9012b548b1e5Mnemonic: candy maple cake sugar pudding cream honey rich smooth crumble sweet treat\u26a0\ufe0f  Important \u26a0\ufe0f  : This mnemonic was created for you by Truffle. It is not secure.Ensure you do not use it on production blockchains, or else you risk losing funds.truffle(develop)>Your accounts and private keys will be different than mine.Now we have accounts ready and our development blockchain spun up, we can test our smart contract.Before that, let\u2019s run few commands and test the balance of our accounts. Replace my account number with your account in the command below.web3.eth.getBalance(\u201c0x627306090abab3a6e1400e9345bc60c78a8bef57\u201d)Result - BigNumber { s: 1, e: 20, c: [ 1000000 ] }As you can see, above command gives result in BigNumber. You need to convert that into number format using .toNumber() function.web3.eth.getBalance(\"0x627306090abab3a6e1400e9345bc60c78a8bef57\").toNumber()Result -  100000000000000000000This shows balance in WEI (smallest ethereum unit / 1 ethereum = 1\u2070\u00b9\u2078 wei). To convert this into the ether, you need to use web3.fromWei() function.web3.fromWei(web3.eth.getBalance(\u201c0x627306090abab3a6e1400e9345bc60c78a8bef57\u201d).toNumber())Result - '100' <<< Number of ethereum on the test account Image sourceNow, we need to deploy our smart contract.You can use either deploy command or migrate command. You don\u2019t need to prefix truffle with commands on truffle CLI.deploy or migrate You can use reset flag ( \u2014 reset) while redeploying your contracts to get the initial state of the blockchain.Test Cases-Now let\u2019s write some test cases to test our smart contract.Create a file CrudApp.js (name should be same as smart contract file) under test directory and copy below code.const CrudApp = artifacts.require('./CrudApp.sol')const assert = require('assert')let crudInstance;contract('CrudApp' , (accounts)  => { beforeEach(async () => {  crudInstance = await CrudApp.deployed() })it('should insert new user' , async() => {  await crudInstance.insert(\"USA\" , \"Trump\", 30000000);const country = await crudInstance.getCountry(\"USA\");  assert.equal(country[0] , \"USA\");  assert.equal(country[1] , \"Trump\");  assert.equal(country[2].toNumber() , 30000000);await crudInstance.updateLeader(\"USA\" , \"Hillary\");const country1 = await crudInstance.getCountry(\"USA\");  assert.equal(country1[0] , \"USA\");  assert.equal(country1[1] , \"Hillary\");  assert.equal(country1[2].toNumber() , 30000000);await crudInstance.deleteCountry(\"USA\");const total = await crudInstance.getTotalCountries();  assert.equal(total , 0); })})Let\u2019s walk through our code and understand it.We imported our contract and assert library, which created an instance of our contract after deploying it (CrudApp.deployed()). Then we simply wrote three test case in which we are testing all four operations.First, we are inserting a record and then updating and deleting it, respectively.You can write test cases in Solidity too, but we choose Javascript, as Truffle makes it easy to test our contract.You can also run few commands directly on Truffle console and also interact with our smart contract using Truffle CLI (Command Line Interface).truffle(develop)>  Above is what we calling Truffle CLI. Running commands on truffle.  Let\u2019s get an instance of our smart contract using this command.CrudApp.deployed().then(function(instance) { crud = instance;})This will give us an instance (crud) of our smart contract, let\u2019s play with it. This instance is simple ABI (Application Binary Unterface) you can check it just printing crud.ABI is the interface between two program modules, one of which is often at the level of machine code. The interface is the de facto method for encoding/decoding data into/out of the machine code.Let\u2019s check the total number of countries by running this command.crud.getTotalCountries().then(function(num){var str= num.toString(); console.log(str)});Let insert a new countrycrud.insert(\"USA\",\"Trump\",30000000);The result should be something like this.{ tx: '0x6502bd013b41f246e31f071690ffb1c8f41d21c4cddbad8bb99bf53d9ac6c982',  receipt:    { transactionHash: '0x6502bd013b41f246e31f071690ffb1c8f41d21c4cddbad8bb99bf53d9ac6c982',     transactionIndex: 0,     blockHash: '0x297ed89cf22d78956e019100fd15ece49882124ba6d23476c4e48914d3da35f3',     blockNumber: 42,     gasUsed: 129230,     cumulativeGasUsed: 129230,     contractAddress: null,     logs: [ [Object] ],     status: '0x01',     logsBloom: '0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000008000000000000000000000000000000000000000000008000000000000000000000002000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000400000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000004000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000200000000000000000000000000000000000000000' },  logs:    [ { logIndex: 0,       transactionIndex: 0,       transactionHash: '0x6502bd013b41f246e31f071690ffb1c8f41d21c4cddbad8bb99bf53d9ac6c982',       blockHash: '0x297ed89cf22d78956e019100fd15ece49882124ba6d23476c4e48914d3da35f3',       blockNumber: 42,       address: '0x8f0483125fcb9aaaefa9209d8e9d7b9c8b9fb90f',       type: 'mined',       event: 'CountryEvent',       args: [Object] } ] }This is transaction receipt you can see that our country event gets fired too. Whenever you change blockchain state, it has to be a transaction and transactions consume gas.Now let\u2019s check our entry by running this commandcrud.getCountry(\"USA\");You should see a result something like this.[ 'USA', 'Trump', BigNumber { s: 1, e: 7, c: [ 30000000 ] } ]You\u2019ve now learned how to interact with smart contract, and how to test it!Show me what you\u2019ve built in the comment section.ConclusionWe have learned how to do basic CRUD operations using solidity and test our smart contract. We cut down on details which can be overwhelming for the sake of brevity. Solidity and Truffle have extensive documentation and you should read them. Also, we used web3.js which comes with Truffle bundle.There are multiple ways to optimize our CRUD operations (Hint : you can use an external array).

This was a great opportunity for us to kick off some bounties and introduce the MythX smart contract security API to a wider audience. We were excited to see what developers would come up with and the results didn\u2019t disappoint! We received a total of 16 submissions and awarded a total of 5,000 Dai worth of prizes to 7 winners.While some of the submissions are still a bit rough around the edges, they go a long way in showing the many use-cases enabled by our API. Here are some of our favorites.MythX Plugin for Embark FrameworkMythX for Embark by Sebastian M\u00fcller and Flex Dapps brings MythX security analysis to Status Embark.From you Embark project directory, install it with npm i embark-mythx and follow the configuration instructions in the README. This adds a new \u201cverify\u201d console command that runs security tests on the smart contracts contained in the project. The analysis runs asynchronously in the background. When the analysis is completed, each discovered security issues is listed with line and column number, a short description, and a smart contract weakness classification ID (you can use this ID to look up more detailed desciptions in the SWC registry).Truffle Sca2tTruffle Sca2t (pronounced \u201cSk\u00e4rt\u201d) by Teruhiro Tagomori of NRI Secure is a plugin for Truffle framework that assists smart contract auditors in their day-to-day workflow. Besides some other nice features, such as rendering dependency graphs, it integrates MythX in interesting and useful ways:It generates Mocha test files that can be used to integrate MythX into continuous integration frameworks like Circle CI, Travis and Jenkins;It can export Postman Collection files for MythX API interactions;It comes with a standalone command line interface for running security analysis on one or multiple smart contracts.To top things off, the command line interface can export nice HTML and markdown reports.GitMythXGitMythX by Marin Petruni\u0107 (Node Factory) is a Github app for continuous integration of MythX security checks. More specifically, it analyzes the smart contracts contained in the repository on every pull request. The test passes if MythX returns no security issues. If issues are detected, the test fails and GitMythX generates an HTML report detailing the issues.Alternatively, Kirk Ballou describes how to integrate MythX with CircleCI using the Mythos command line tool.MythX Vulnerability MonitorMythX Vulnerability Monitor by Belma Gutlic (Node Factory) is a web app for monitoring smart contracts deployed to the Ethereum mainnet. The app allows the user to register a smart contract address that is then periodically scanned for security issues. If a vulnerability is discovered the contract owner is alerted by email. This ensures that contract owners can react if a new vulnerability class is discovered or an upgrade to the EVM introduces a vulnerability.Setting up the MythX Vulnerability MonitorMore Awesome MythX ToolsThese are just a few of the first-generation MythX smart contract security tools and integrations. Many more are in the pipeline \u2014 including tools for other smart contract platforms such as Roostock, Tron, Quorum and Vechain. A revamped MythX website and a searchable partners & tools directory will be released soon. For now, check out the growing MythX awesome list and join our Discord server.About Mythril and MythXMythril is a free and open-source smart contract security analyzer. It uses symbolic execution to detect a variety of security vulnerabilities.MythX is a cloud-based smart contract security service that seamlessly integrates into smart contract development environments and build pipelines.

MANC suggests it\u2019s much easier to paddle through life\u2019s routines than question the basic premise of the routines and make changes. Because of how hard it is to disrupt our own routines and patterns, we need the help of others.In this post, I will share what our house has learned so far.I\u2019ll start with my personal story.My MANC goal is to be able to set aside two hours a week, two times a week to push forward my learning objectives. This is really not much. After allowing for 8 hours of sleep, we have 80 hours during the weekdays to play with. My goal is to simply spend 5% of that on learning!Yet, in the busyness of life (like many people) I tend to prioritize the seemingly urgent requirements of work and the pleasant but many times obligatory requirements of social life. My longer term intentions frequently suffer when faced with the allure of immediate temptations.My MANC plan, which was approved by the housemates, was to spend one morning and one evening learning R, a statistical tool for data analysis. I picked this as my first challenge because I knew it wouldn\u2019t be easy. While I want to learn R, learning R is not urgent nor is it required for my work. If I can design a system for this, my reasoning was that I could design a system for anything.Lesson 1: The Truffle Oil effect.When we go grocery shopping, we tend to have a rough budget in our heads. While at the grocery store we may realize a dinner party is coming up and we need something a little extra \u2014 truffle oil.The question: Do we include truffle oil in our grocery shopping budget next week? Of course not! Truffle oil was something abnormal we purchased. Next week we won\u2019t need truffle oil. Our budget should stay the same.Next week arrives.We go grocery shopping. While at the store we realize that our relatives are in town and we should buy them their favorite pastries for Sunday breakfast. Do we include these pastries in our budget next week? Of course not. Next week we won\u2019t need pastries. Our budget should stay the same.\u2026And so on and on.Every week we believe should be \u2018normal\u2019 but very week we have some \u2018extra\u2019 expense.Abigail Sussman and Adam Alter wrote a very nice paper documenting this \u2018truffle oil\u2019 effect within expense management.* And I realized in the first three weeks of my MANC that I was treating scheduling like buying truffle oil.Something would come up \u2014 like travel or a big meeting \u2014 and I would miss my study sessions.I would rationalize that \u2018this week was different\u2019.Next week would be normal and I wouldn\u2019t have the travel or big meeting. Of course, the next week was not normal.A social engagement came up that was impossible to decline. I went to this social engagement and attributed it to the anomaly that it was. Because of that, I did not adjust my schedule for the following week.\u2026And so on and on. After 3 weeks I had failed. I had only accomplished 2 of the 6 study sessions I had scheduled.Every week I had not accounted for \u201ctruffle oil\u201d in my time budget and every week I skipped my diligently scheduled study sessions.The reality is that all of us tend to be poor at accounting for our expenses and our time. We have some sense of what is a \u201cnormal\u201d week looks like and we make plans based off of this anchor. Sadly, each week is not \u2018normal\u2019.For my MANC to work, I needed something more than just calendaring.Lesson 2: HARD COMMITMENTSI needed a hard commitment. This is NOT the \u201cI\u2019ll see you out later tonight!\u201d commitment.A hard commitment is one in which someone else is really counting on you. You\u2019d be an asshole (or lose money) if you backed out at the last minute.Hard commitments have saved my MANC.I decided to hire a tutor for Tuesday from 7pm \u2014 9pm. My first tutoring lesson cost $80 and I turned down two social options to make it. Note: There is NO way I would have turned down these two appealing social options had John from Wyzant not been waiting for me.Now, for the last 3 weeks, every Tuesday, John and I have had a date to learn R.My real breakthrough came last week when I required him to give me homework. This enabled me to feel obligated to him enough to complete the additional two study hours outside of our tutoring session.I believe if I keep this up for another 3 weeks (with the homework!) I will have sufficient knowledge of R for the purposes I set out to achieve.Of course, the real goal is to figure out how to set up a scalable system such that it doesn\u2019t rely (completely) on expensive tutoring.Thus far, my roommates have made interesting progress on this. They made hard commitments\u2026 and they have made progress on their goals!Person 1:His goal was to push forward a professional interest such that at the end of three months he could send an email to his network with a concrete data driven proposal. To do this side project, he would need to be diligent about his priorities after work. To support this, he pre-scheduled every day for the next 3 months and shared his calendar with the housemates! The catch? The events and activities he scheduled were difficult to back out of without money or social capital costs. Now the housemates 1) know exactly what he is supposed to be doing each week night and 2) don\u2019t feel bad if he says no to a spontaneous event that isn\u2019t inline with his calendar.Person 2:She pre-scheduled a dinner with our housemates brainstorm on her new business idea. This caused her to work over the weekend and articulate her thoughts enough to share them with others. Without this dinner as a hard commitment, she would have continued to refine ideas without moving quickly to the next step.Person 3:This person wants to design a lifestyle that isn\u2019t reliant on working 12 hours a day.

He passed out laminated sheets that outlined potential upcoming trips and asked for comments from the group.

It also has an incorporated package specification using the ERC190 standard. ERC190 is a request for comments, which lays down a set of rules about package specifications for Ethereum smart contracts.Asset pipelining for Ethereum is a concept that has been borrowed from Ruby on Rails. This feature provides a framework to concatenate, minify, or compress JavaScript, Solidity, and CSS assets in the required sequence of execution. This feature helps the developer to create compressed and pre-processed library-like modules that can be reused by other coding modules, which helps in improving productivity.Working on a DemoStep 1: We will start by installing the Truffle framework. The installation is pretty straightforward and can be accomplished in the Git Bash window with the following command:$ npm install -g truffleInstallation inside a new folder named TruffleStep 2: After the installation, we need to initiate the framework, which can be done as shown in the next figure.If you run into any trouble during installation or initiation, please refer to the Ethereum stack exchange or Truffle documentation for the known troubleshooting issues.It is to be noted that, to initiate Truffle for a new project, we must always use the Truffle init command in a new folder with a custom project name. We cannot initiate Truffle in a project folder where the Truffle framework is already initiated, as this then throws an exception.This is how it works:Initiation of Truffle frameworkStep 3: Let\u2019s now create a simple ERC20-compatible token. For this, we create a new folder, ERC20_token, inside the private-truffle-project folder and write a solidity file, ScratchToken.sol, inside it.We place the solidity file, along with the Migration.sol file, inside the contract folder.Now, we open another Git Bash window and type in testrpc to start the testnet :Starting testrpcStep 4: In the old Git Bash window, we change the truffle.js file to point to our localhost:Truffle.js configuration changesStep 5: Compile the .sol files, as shown in the next figure; they can now be deployed using the command truffle.cmd deploy in the testnet:Compiling ScratchToken.solThis is how we deploy a basic ERC20-compliant token using the Truffle framework. We can add more functionality for incorporating other ERC20-compliant functions that are required for a full-fledged token with security enhancements.Functions and more infoAn ERC20-compliant token must have the following list of functions with the same naming convention:totalSupply (): This function has no arguments and gets back the total supply of tokens that is in circulation.For example, if we create an ERC20 token that imitates the bitcoin ideology, then the totalSupply() would fetch 21 million as a number,balanceOf (owner): This function has an argument inside the parenthesis, which is the address of the owner.Hence, this balanceOf function needs address of the owner to return back the balance value.transfer (to, value): This function has two arguments, namely, the address of the to, that is, the recipient\u2019s address, and the value of how many tokens needs to be sent to that address.transferFrom (from,to,value): This function has three arguments, namely, the sender\u2019s address, the recipient\u2019s address, and the value of the token that needs to be transferred.approve (spender,value): This function empowers the owner to approve a third-party entity to spend tokens up to a designated maximum valueallowance (owner, spender): This function allows the owner to empower a third-party entity to spend tokens on their behalf, without enforcing any spending limit.In addition to the previous functions, such a token has two events:event Transfer(from, to, tokens)event Approval(tokenOwner, spender, tokens)For example, if there is a token that has a totalSupplyInCirculation() function, which has the same functionality as totalSupply(), the token is ERC20-non-compliant, because the function name has changed.Events, on the other hand, are broadcast throughout the network. For example, when a transfer occurs, a transfer event is broadcast throughout the network so that the network is aware of the transaction and the blocks are updated accordingly in the blockchain. Approval events are also broadcast in a similar manner to make the network aware of the change of authority of the spender\u2019s address.Ethereum Smart Contract DevelopmentIf you found this article an interesting read, you can try Ethereum Smart Contract Development to Become an Ethereum Blockchain developer using a blend of concepts and hands-on implementations.

They\u2019ve been audited and battle-tested in the real world so if you aren\u2019t using them to do your contracts, you probably should be.If you\u2019ve deployed a smart contract before, you may have used Truffle Framework to build and deploy the contracts since that\u2019s what it says to use in their docs. The web3 CLI tool is an alternative that does not require any config files or JavaScript, just straight CLI commands.Deploy an ERC-20 Contract in 2 MinutesFirst, install the web3 command line tool which you\u2019ll use throughout this article:curl -LSs https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gochain-io/web3/master/install.sh | shThe following is a simple ERC20 contract using OpenZeppelin. Copy the code and paste into a file called token.sol:Get the OpenZeppelin libraries. In the same directory as token.sol, run:git clone --depth 1 --branch master https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity lib/ozrm -rf lib/oz/.gitNow build your contract.web3 contract build token.solThis will compile your contract and generate two files: CappedToken.bin and CappedToken.abi.Let\u2019s deploy it to a local node to test it out first. Start a local GoChain node for development (remember this is 100% Ethereum compatible so you can still use this for testing even if you plan to deploy to Ethereum later).web3 startThis will start a GoChain node, automatically generate a new private key for you, and fund it with GO. You can then use that private key to deploy and use your node immediately. Copy the private key from the output and use that in the export below:export WEB3_NETWORK=localhostexport WEB3_PRIVATE_KEY=[YOUR PRIVATE KEY]Deploy the contract:web3 contract deploy CappedToken.binBoom! It\u2019s deployed. Easy huh? This will return the address of your contract. Copy the address and run:export WEB3_ADDRESS=[CONTRACT_ADDRESS]Now you can interact with your contract. Since this is an ERC-20 contract, let\u2019s mint some tokens for yourself and then transfer some of those to another address.web3 contract call --abi CappedToken.abi --function mint $(web3 myaddress) 1000000000000000000000Now we can check our balance to make sure it worked.web3 contract call --abi CappedToken.abi --function balanceOf $(web3 myaddress)That should return: \u201cCall results: 1000000000000000000000\u201d. which means you have 1000 tokens! (1000* 10\u00b9\u2078, ERC-20 contracts typically use 18 decimal places so the number look pretty massive).To transfer to another account, let\u2019s first create a second account:web3 account createCopy the public address that returns then call:web3 contract call --abi CappedToken.abi --function transfer [NEW_ADDRESS] 1000000000000000000Now you can check your balance again and see that it went down and check the balance of the new account to see that there\u2019s went up.

Source: Glen MacLartyBy Marlene CimonsScientist Paul Thomas won\u2019t forget the first time he ripped into a package of truffles he ordered from France after his own attempts to forage for this delicacy in the UK had failed. \u201cOnce I opened the packet, the aroma filled my house,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cThey flavored everything in our fridge. I was hooked.\u201dThomas can\u2019t get enough of the ugly but intensively flavorful fungi. He cultivates them. He cooks with them. He even helps organize Napa Valley\u2019s yearly truffle festival. Thomas, an academic in the department of natural sciences at the University of Stirling, has been studying truffles since the early 2000s. Much to his horror, his most recent research suggests that this prized gourmet treat \u2014 specifically Tuber melanosporum, a species of black truffle \u2014 may vanish from southern Europe by the end of this century. The reason \u2014 as is the case with many foods today \u2014 is climate change. Heatwaves, drought, forest fires, pests and diseases threaten to eradicate truffles.For those who have never experienced the exquisite pleasure of tasting one, 18th century French gourmet Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin described the truffle as \u201cthe diamond of the kitchen\u201d \u2014 perhaps because of both its flavor and its cost. The threatened species of black truffle typically sells for around $600 for a pound, according to the study.Tuber melanosporum, a species of black truffle. Source: Michel Royon\u201cYes, expensive but worth it,\u201d said former Washington, D.C. chef Colin Potts. \u201cTheir aroma and flavor of earthiness can\u2019t be matched by any other ingredient.\u201d A world without truffles, Potts said, \u201cwould be a culinary disaster \u2014 we would lose one of the greatest food experiences.\u201dStudy co-author Ulf B\u00fcntgen of Cambridge University, who previously found that drought can severely hamper truffle growth, joined with Thomas to forecast the effects of climate change. Like droughts, heatwaves can be fatal for truffles, \u201cand the duration, frequency and intensity of such events are increasing due to climate change,\u201d Thomas said.\u201cIn this paper we primarily focus on summer temperatures and precipitation and show that because of increases in the former and decreases in the latter, truffle production will decline,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cThe truffles are initiated in late winter and slowly grow over the summer months before maturing in winter. Consequently, drought over the summer months hampers truffle development.\u201d Their findings were published in the journal Science of the Total Environment.A sliced black truffle. Source: DaieuxetdailleursResearchers gathered data on more than three decades of truffle production in Italy, France and Spain, and compared it with data on temperature and precipitation to predict the future impact of climate change. \u201cThe results were extremely surprising in their severity and speed of impact,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cWe have cultivation sites in Spain and France, and we now know that these will have a difficult future.\u201d Climate change could wreak havoc on black truffles grown in the P\u00e9rigord region of France, for example, which are particularly sensitive to heat and drought in late spring and summer.Thomas said there likely still may be areas where the weather remains favorable enough to grow black truffles. Furthermore, \u201csome of the impacts of climate change can be counteracted by irrigation, but unfortunately the models also show that there will be a lot less water available\u2026 so this is very unlikely to be able to save the industry.\u201d And it\u2019s not only black truffles that are threatened by climate change. The researchers are now looking at summer truffles \u201cand early indications show that they are also surprisingly sensitive to changes in moisture and temperature,\u201d Thomas said,For many years, truffle hunters used pigs and wild boar to sniff out the rare and expensive delicacy, which grow underground in forests. Today, however, more than 90 percent of truffles that originate in France are cultivated, according to Thomas, and they are harvested by trained dogs rather than wild boar. \u201cThis method started in the 70s,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cTruffle production in Europe was declining due to changing land use and loss of wild habitat, and cultivation managed to stem this decline.\u201dA truffle pig at work. Source: Robert Vayssi\u00e9However, truffles still are quite expensive because they are so rare. Every year, French growers plant 400,000 truffle trees \u2014 trees inoculated with the truffle fungus, \u201cbut this has only been enough to keep their truffle production relatively static,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cThe supply-demand price response of truffles is evident in unusually dry and warm years in Europe, when production suffers and consequently prices rise quite dramatically. For example in 2004, the prices paid for black truffles doubled because there were such low levels of production.\u201dBecause truffles now can be cultivated, growers in Australia, New Zealand, South America, South Africa and the United States have gotten into the business. \u201cUSA production is still quite small, but this is forecast to increase as more plantations are established,\u201d said Thomas, who also serves as chief scientist for the American Truffle Company. For now, growers in Italy, France and Spain produce around 95 percent of the world\u2019s supply, he said, which amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars of economic activity.Truffles don\u2019t just generate income. They are also a rich source of cultural inspiration. There are truffle museums, truffle markets, and societies and rituals that evolve around truffles, for example, the France-based Confr\u00e9rie de la Truffe Noire \u2014 Brotherhood of the Truffle \u2014 and the Richerenches Mass, a service honoring Saint Anthony, the patron saint of truffle farmers, Thomas said. The fungi hold a special place for both growers and gourmets.\u201cTruffles elevate dishes to levels of perfection,\u201d Potts said. \u201cI actually salivate when I think about them.\u201dMarlene Cimons writes for Nexus Media, a syndicated newswire covering climate, energy, policy, art and culture.", "responses": 1, "tags": ["Climate Change", "Food And Health", "Food", "Agriculture", "Cooking"]}, {"title": "Truffle Leek Soup", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@kidbombay/truffle-leek-soup-26edfc94e513?source=search_post", "author_name": "Ketan Anjaria", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@kidbombay", "publish_date": "2013-07-08", "last_modified_date": "2013-07-08", "readtime": "1.82", "claps": 2, "voters": 2, "content": "Truffle Leek SoupA simple soup that you can make in 15 minutesKetan AnjariaFollowJul 8, 2013 \u00b7 2 min readIngredients1 Large White Onion Diced2 Large Leeks Finely Sliced4 Cloves Garlic - Minced or Garlic Press1 Zucchini - Halved & Medium SliceSpinach Leaves for Garnish2 Tablespoons Butter2 Tablespoons Truffle Oil2 Ts Celery Seed2 Ts Oregano2 Ts Dried Parsley1 Ts Marjoram1 Ts Raw Cane Sugar2 Bunch of Bay Leaves2 Dried Red ChiliesPinch of Cayene PowderSalt & PepperThe SauteMelt the butter over high heat in a stock pot.

The sugar is added to mellow out the flavor.The zucchini shouldn\u2019t be cut too thin, it cooks quickly and breaks down, you want to stand strong in the final soup.If done right, this only takes about 15 minutes. 5 Minutes to prep, 5 minutes to cook and 5 minutes to simmer.

Plebiea can reduce the size of the current state repository of Tezos down to 1\u204410. More importantly, since Plebeia is a straightforward implementation of sparse Merkle tree, it can provide Merkle proofs of values easily to lightweight wallets which cannot carry the whole states of blockchain.Upcoming events:Today \u2014 Developer deep dive talk on Tezos + LIGO presented by Arthur Breitman + Nomadic Labs.August 22, 2019 | 11:00AM \u2014 9:00PM \u2014 TQUORUM: BERLINArthur Breitman will be speaking about Tezos and blockchain technologies in general at #BFC2019EU in Dublin, October 7th to 9th.FinanceInformation from Tzscan.ioSource: coinmarketcapPartnerships and team membersAn additional grant to TezTechLabs to support the development of two new projects and many more that already contribute to the advancement of the Tezos ecosystem!

I think it began in the summer when I was about six. My family would rent a house in Cape May, NJ, and all pile in and spend a week or two on the beach. This included my aunt, who has long lived outside Minneapolis with her husband, a native Minnesotan. Soon they began to bring a group of friends every year. Friends who called soda \u201cpop\u201d and made potato salad with pickle juice and drank more beer than anyone I\u2019ve ever met. And they said things like \u201cdontcha know\u201d and \u201cooh yah\u201d and it was just so foreign. Then I grew up and saw Fargo, and the obsession became official.A few seasons ago I went to Minnesota, to visit my family and a close friend from college, who happened to be the one to introduce me to hot dish. However, my hot dish was not traditional hot dish. It was total hipster hot dish, and it was fantastic. It was made with short ribs and a beschamel sauce, and it had TRUFFLE TATER TOTS on top, and I was so sickly full after eating it, but I didn\u2019t even care. I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about it, and even when my wonderful roommate, bless her heart, made good-ol\u2019 working-class hot dish with delicious tots and salty ground beef, it just couldn\u2019t compare.This is my attempt to recreate that magical hipster dish. There\u2019s truffle oil and short rib and wine, and, okay, regular crispy potatoes instead of tots (though you could definitely put tots in this), and even though it\u2019s not exactly what I had, I feel happy making it.A note on casseroles: I can\u2019t be the only one who gets confused about French casseroles and American casseroles, right? Growing up, I always assumed a casserole was something weird and gooey baked in a 9x13 pyrex dish, but it turns out that\u2019s just me being an ignorant American, and a casserole is basically a French Dutch oven, and that\u2019s definitely what you should be using for this. Also definitely get out of the habit of going for the pyrex every time you see a \u201ccasserole\u201d recipe that doesn\u2019t specify. Though maybe they should just start specifying because NOT ALL OF US KNOW ABOUT YOUR FANCY FRENCH COOKWARE.Ingredients3 pounds beef short rib cut in serving-size pieces (no bones) 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 medium onion, chopped 1 1/2 cup water 1/4 cup brown sugar 1 tablespoon flour A few drops hot pepper sauce (I use Crystal hot sauce, and go a little heavy with 10 drops or so) 1 teaspoon dry mustard 2 tablespoons red wine 1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice 1 bay leaf salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste 1/2 package of frozen hash browns, or if you\u2019re not incredibly lazy like me, about three potatoes, boiled, cooled and diced. A drizzles-worth of white truffle oilDirections1. Heat oven to 325 F. Trim excess fat from ribs; brown in oil (making sure to always splatter yourself, no matter how hard you try and how much you dry the beef beforehand). Place ribs in a deep 2 1/2- to 3-quart FRENCH casserole. Saute onion in meat drippings, adding a little more oil if you need to; add water and bring to boil. Mmmmm, hot onion water.2. Pour onion water over ribs; cover and bake for 2 hours, or until almost tender. Pour off juice into saucepan (better yet, remove beef bits with tongs, then pour liquid into a saucepan, then put beef bits back in casserole dish) and combine with sugar, flour, hot pepper sauce, mustard, vinegar, lemon juice, and bay leaf. Bring to boil, stirring constantly, and cook until all the bits are melted together and it\u2019s a little thickened, but not like, actual gravy thickened. Season with salt and pepper; pour over ribs and bake, uncovered, for 1 hour or until meat is tender.3. About 15 minutes before that hour is up, start cooking your frozen/fresh potatoes/tater tots in a skillet to get them nice and browned and crispy. Take out casserole and put the potatoes on top. Drizzle well with white truffle oil, and throw it back in the oven for another half hour. Then remove, let cool for a second so you don\u2019t hurt your mouth, and serve! Best enjoyed with some red wine and the ABC Family run of Lion King, as I discovered this weekend.Jaya Saxena doesn\u2019t make enough to be buying white truffle oil all willy-nilly like this.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Casseroles", "Deep Dish"]}, {"title": "Savings and Snapchat: How Truffle Pig is Helping Millennials with Their Money", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@AdCouncil/savings-and-snapchat-how-truffle-pig-is-helping-millennials-with-their-money-53e93e425b42?source=search_post", "author_name": "Ad Council", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@AdCouncil", "publish_date": "2016-04-26", "last_modified_date": "2017-12-12", "readtime": "4.49", "claps": 1, "voters": 1, "content": "Savings and Snapchat: How Truffle Pig is Helping Millennials with Their MoneyAd CouncilFollowApr 26, 2016 \u00b7 5 min readJudges at the Feed the Pig Games Design Challenge Event at the Games for Change Game + Media Summit in New York City on April 18.Saving is hard. As millennials we\u2019re told from the moment we start working that we need to save for our futures. A recent survey from the Ad Council and American Institute for Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) revealed that one in three millennials ranked saving as their number one goal for the year. And the number one barrier to saving? Impulse spending.Feed the Pig is a joint effort between the Ad Council and AICPA to help young adults adopt positive saving habits at a time they are making major decisions \u2014 starting a career, buying a house, getting married, starting a family \u2014 all of which will greatly impact their finances. The campaign websiteFeedthePig.org includes tips, resources and simple tools to help them save for their goals, whatever they may be.To celebrate the campaign\u2019s 10th anniversary, Feed the Pig has collaborated on new content with a number of partners including Games for Change, IFTTT and Upworthy, and with the help of content marketing company Truffle Pig has brought Benjamin Bankes (the campaign\u2019s mascot) to Snapchatand Instagram. We sat down with Truffle Pig\u2019s President Paul Marcum to get his thoughts on theFeed The Pig social strategy and all things Snapchat.Ad Council: Beyond the amazing brand alignment (Feed the Pig/Truffle Pig), what made you want to get involved in the Feed the Pig campaign?Paul Marcum: Our team at Truffle Pig knows how hard it is to save (we have offices in NY and LA, after all) and, as we dug in the content at feedthepig.org, we saw so much that could be helpful and extend into a number of channels.AC: How do you/does Truffle Pig approach a social issue like helping and encouraging people to become financially literate?PM: We want to thread it into the everyday: take concepts that may seem a bit academic and demonstrate them using real-life scenarios, de-stigmatize the discussion of the topic and provide advocates for the importance of savings who are more peer than parent.AC: What\u2019s your favorite part of the Truffle Pig\u2019s social strategy for Feed the Pig?PM: We\u2019re excited to move Feed the Pig into two channels \u2014 the new benjaminbankes handle on Snapchat and the Feed the Pig recipes on IFTTT \u2014 that we see as creating new habits for the audience. Snapchat daily usage has of course exploded and learning to tell the Feed the Pig story in that context is essential to remaining relevant. IFTTT is amazing in that it allows for the creation of entirely new, automated routines that can help users save. In many ways it\u2019s the channel where Feed the Pig can be the most integrated in the lives of their audience.AC: Our goal is to reach millennials so they can truly become financially literate and plan for their futures. How did that larger goal guide your strategy and content development?PM: We want the audience to internalize many of the calculators available at feedthepig.org \u2014 to apply that math to scenarios that feel incredibly familiar and demonstrate decisions that are achievable. We think there\u2019s an opportunity to make financial literacy a daily moment.AC: A lot of social media channels are pay to play. How can nonprofits with limited budgets stand out in the social space?PM: Look for new features and platforms. Platforms push new features aggressively and it\u2019s often an opportunity to ride their promotion if your ability to fund your own reach is limited. We\u2019re seeing this now with Facebook Live Video and Feed the Pig leveraged that quickly with a simple but effective Q&A around taxes.AC: Tell us a bit about yourself: How has your previous experience informed your work?PM: I\u2019ve been fortunate to work with a pretty wide variety of iconic brands \u2014 doubt you\u2019ll find anyone who\u2019s been at GE, Sesame Street and Bloomberg \u2014 as they embrace new platforms. Doing this successfully requires what I think of as finding a new latitude for the brand \u2014 identifying what you can use from existing channels and knowing how far you can push into a new context without losing brand equity or seeming silly. Once you have confidence in the process you can find some great opportunities for brands to remain vital.AC: What is your favorite social platform and why?PM: Snapchat! It\u2019s joyful in a way that no other media platform is today. It offers an amazing array of visual tools and a more engaging integration between the virtual and the physical than we\u2019ve seen in social so far. Of course, we see exciting developments across so many other platforms as well \u2014 Facebook\u2019s live video is off to an amazing start and we predict that Twitter\u2019s NFL streaming will be an amazing experience for fans.AC: We know everyone is obsessed with Snapchat. What\u2019s your advice for nonprofit organizations launching on Snapchat?PM: Know that you don\u2019t have to publish every day. It may actually be better to hold your budget until you find an opportunity where you can leverage an event, paid and organic to drive awareness and engagement. Try to remember too that the platform and your presence on it is newer by years than elsewhere \u2014 growth and fluency take time.AC: Social media moves so fast. How do you stay ahead and what social/digital trends are you most excited about?PM: I never stop reading and at Truffle Pig I\u2019m surrounded by an incredibly talented team that loves media as much as I do. Perhaps you\u2019ll find this surprising but it has actually gotten a lot easier to stay ahead the longer I\u2019ve been in digital media. Though my jokes comparing some of today\u2019s distribution deals to old AOL Anchor Tenant agreements seldom get any laughs, the parallels are unmistakable. The economics of attention are pretty straightforward.I\u2019m most excited today by the incredible power of automation, connected devices and mobile. They\u2019re combining to give consumers efficiency never before seen and I think it leaves marketers with two choices: engage or serve. Interruptions have very little room in the lives of those who are incredibly efficient but successful distractions are still possible if you know the rules of the environment. A brand needs to be fluent across so many platforms to succeed \u2014 our goal with Truffle Pig is to help brands always align with user intent.AC: Ok, I\u2019ve got to ask. Why the name Truffle Pig?PM: It takes a humble beast with a nose for the extraordinary to consistently deliver great ideas. The reaction to the name has been extraordinary \u2014 we\u2019ve actually received offers to buy t-shirts with our logo on them through our site.This post originally appeared on AdLibbing.org.Apr 21 By: Kat English", "responses": 1, "tags": ["Marketing", "Snapchat"]}, {"title": "Black Mayonnaise Isn\u2019t Just An Aoili For Your Truffle Fries", "post_link": "https://nyulocal.com/black-mayonnaise-isnt-just-an-aoili-for-your-truffle-fries-d181cd7c3054?source=search_post", "author_name": "NYU Local", "author_link": "https://nyulocal.com/@nyulocal", "publish_date": "2013-03-06", "last_modified_date": "2017-05-20", "readtime": "2.15", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "Black Mayonnaise Isn\u2019t Just An Aoili For Your Truffle FriesNYU LocalFollowMar 6, 2013 \u00b7 3 min readBy Melissa CroninFor most people, New York City is a mecca of progressive values, of gentrification, of green canvas bags filled with organic beets and hydroponic kale. But little did the mason jar-toting, cruiser-riding, Toms-wearing among us know, our city, which has been hailed as one of the most environmentally-friendly large metropolises, is actually harboring one of the most polluted areas in the country \u2014 and it lies just across the East River.Newtown Creek, a water body running through industrial and residential areas in Brooklyn and Queens, hosts an oil slick larger that the Exxon Valdez spill \u2014 which, in case you didn\u2019t know, was one of the worst environmental disasters in history, spilling 260,000 to 750,000 barrels off the coast of California and decimating everything in reach.But luckily, momentum is starting to build on the site\u2019s long awaited cleanup \u2014 the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is moving forward with plans to clean the 30 million gallons left there by the Greenpoint oil spill \u2014 a steady flow of industrial pollutants in the area that was discovered in 1978. The oil concentration, charmingly referred to by scientists as \u201cblack mayonnaise,\u201d takes the form of a 15-foot-thick layer of petroleum lining the bottom of the creek, alarmingly close to the 300,000 people living in Greenpoint nearby.\u201cIt\u2019s the byproduct of our society,\u201d John Lipscomb of the Riverkeeper clean-water advocacy group, told the AP. \u201cWhat was originally a watershed is now a sewage shed.\u201dAlthough the site was originally declared a Superfund in 2010 (a site designated by the EPA as an extreme priority for mitigation), little progress has been made since then, and the site remains clearly polluted \u2014 you can even smell the chemicals\u2019 stench from the shore. Although 12 million gallons of oil have been extracted thanks in part to a $19.5 million payment by Exxon Mobil, the city\u2019s combined sewage system \u2014 another giant environmental problem in itself \u2014 is continually foiling cleanup efforts by dumping untreated waste and groundwater into the area.Hurricane Sandy, the catastrophe that spotlighted so many other infrastructure problems in New York City, also shone a beacon on the atrocious conditions in Newtown Creek. During the storm, the waters surged over its banks, depositing all of those contaminants on the resident-thick streets of Brooklyn.\u201cThe storm was a good thing,\u201d Mitch Waxman, who runs a blog on Newtown, told Curbed, \u201cin that it raised people\u2019s awareness. It\u2019s kind of the wake up call to this archipelago city of ours.\u201dCommunity members like the Newtown Creek Alliance hope that the damage inflicted by Sandy will attract attention to the super-polluted spot.\u201cThe hard truth is we don\u2019t fully understand nor are we fully prepared for the area-wide effects of flooding on contaminated sites and sites that store hazardous materials,\u201d the neighborhood coalition wrote on its website following the disaster. \u201c\u2026Never have environmental, economic and equity concerns been so clearly aligned for Newtown Creek and New York City.\u201d[Image via]", "responses": 0, "tags": ["City", "Black Mayonnaise", "Environment", "Pollution"]}, {"title": "My Last Hundred Bucks: Drinks, Truffle Oil, and Sushi", "post_link": "https://medium.com/the-billfold/my-last-hundred-bucks-drinks-truffle-oil-and-sushi-b4396f8a062f?source=search_post", "author_name": "The Billfold", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@TheBillfold", "publish_date": "2012-05-04", "last_modified_date": "2015-12-16", "readtime": "1.72", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "My Last Hundred Bucks: Drinks, Truffle Oil, and SushiThe BillfoldFollowMay 4, 2012 \u00b7 2 min readby Sara Eisen$100!

I can\u2019t wait to hop in the bath \u2014 it\u2019s my comfort place.$22: Emergency stop-off at Whole Foods to stock up on my favorite snack. I spent $4 on a jar of popcorn kernels to be popped on the stove (with olive oil), and $18 on a bottle of truffle oil to be drizzled on top of the popcorn.

We nod our heads, trying to imprison the drifting aroma.The pungent Tuber melanosporum isn\u2019t for everyone. This little gem can provoke instant delight, utter repulsion, or an eventual peaceful entente, a bit of an acquired taste. I admit I\u2019m a fan and if it weren\u2019t for cost, I\u2019d be sprinkling truffles on everything.So what are truffles, anyway?Despite its name, the famed truffe du P\u00e9rigord isn\u2019t limited to the P\u00e9rigord region of southwestern France, just as Brussels sprouts or Belgian endives aren\u2019t necessarily from Belgium. In fact the P\u00e9rigord produces only 20% of France\u2019s truffles. The rest come from right here, in the southeastern d\u00e9partement of the Dr\u00f4me, as well as the Vaucluse, Hautes-Alpes and Var near Provence.\u201cThere are 29 varieties of truffle. Some are so small they have no market value but others, like the black truffle, are worth \u20ac900 (US$ 1,200) a kilo,\u201d said Gilles Ayme, whose great-grandfather founded the Domaine Bramarel, where I\u2019m learning all about truffle prices and types.\u201cThere\u2019s also the summer truffle, which costs between \u20ac250\u2013300. It\u2019s a lot cheaper because it is not as well-known, and it\u2019s smaller so making nice big slices is a lot more difficult. It has a stronger and more peppery taste.\u201dTruffles are nearly a year-round business and April is the only month you won\u2019t find any.Gilles Ayme sniffs his truffles to determine which have the best aromaFinding truffles is hard workFor years truffles were hunted in the wild by sows, whose acute sense of smell mistook the scent for that of a male pig. Unfortunately they often ate what they found, leaving nothing for the rest of us. Dogs may lack the sow\u2019s innate sense of smell but they can be trained to find the truffles \u2014 and most important, to hand them over.\u201cThe truffle is a wild mushroom and lives underground so it has to be found by smell. We use Labradors but you can use any dog \u2014 just get one you like because she\u2019ll be sharing your life for a dozen years,\u201d said Mr Ayme. He prefers female dogs. He thinks they\u2019re less troublesome.As a dog-owner I was particularly curious about the truffle dogs.Training begins early and puppies are fed the cheaper bits of truffle so they learn to like them. Small pieces are then hidden in soft earth (to protect those little snouts) and the puppy encouraged to \u2018find\u2019 them \u2014 and drop them. When that happens she gets a reward.\u201cIt takes about 15 days to train a dog but a young puppy will only work for ten minutes at a time,\u201d Mr Ayme said. \u201cTo work seriously a dog needs to be about four years old.\u201dOnce they are too old they retire, just like we do, but to them it\u2019s a punishment. Raised to love hunting truffles, they are suddenly deprived of their favorite activity.Truffles don\u2019t grow on trees \u2014 do they?Truffles are found among tree roots and some truffle trees, like the oak, are better hosts than others. They also need limestone soils and sufficient water to grow properly.Phala, Gilles\u2019 wife, encourages her dog to search for trufflesTruffles have been around since Antiquity. They lost their popularity around the Middle Ages (some say because they inflamed passions too headily) but staged a comeback during the Renaissance. They really came into their own in the early 1800s when farmers began to cultivate them.Most of today\u2019s production is farmed. Truffle hunting is a popular pastime in the Dr\u00f4me and its environs but the best spots are often auctioned off by local authorities as concessions to weekenders or part-time producers. Apparently there are more truffles than there are hunters around here\u2026 I\u2019d hunt for truffles if I could but I doubt my dogs would ever hand one over.France\u2019s truffle production was once huge, up to 2000 tons a year. A combination of climate, depleted fields, wartime deaths and city-bound farmers dealt production a blow. Today the black truffle is scarce but exact production figures are nearly impossible to find.This elusiveness is part of the attraction \u2014 and what keeps prices high. It is also what has prompted parallel markets, counterfeiting and even the arrival of organized crime, according to some.There are grumblings about the newcomer Chinese truffle, vastly inferior to the black truffle in smell and taste but similar enough to dupe an amateur. Unscrupulous sellers may try to pass them off as French black truffles, not at the well-attended traditional markets where they\u2019d be spotted quickly, but furtively, out of car trunks and in back alleys.\u201cThe only way you can avoid being scammed is to make sure you are buying from a real producer, one with a name, an address, a landline number and a business card,\u201d said Mr Ayme.\u201cThis is why we welcome people to our plantation, so we can explain the qualities of a truffle, the varieties, how to tell them apart and the different prices.\u201dLearning about truffles on a cold, windy day: knowledge is key if you don\u2019t want to be fooled by imitationsKeeping your truffle mushrooms freshHaving spent plenty on buying truffles, you\u2019ll want them to last. You can brush them and place them in an airtight box, wiping the condensation off each day; they last 10\u201315 days this way. You can freeze them for up to a year. Or you can pasteurize them (add salt to a jar, seal it and cook at 100 degrees Celsius for an hour and a half). Pasteurizing preserves truffles for up to 20 years. If you have that kind of patience.Once you decide to eat your truffles (in my case that\u2019s about ten minutes after purchase) the best way is on a \u2018soft\u2019 support, something that doesn\u2019t have too much taste of its own, like pasta or eggs. Just sprinkle on a few shavings, settle back, and enjoy.Back inside the Domaine Bramarel, we were served truffle oil on croutons, with delicious local olives from Nyons on the side. Truffle oil is the way to go if you\u2019re not willing to pay a hundred dollars for something so light you can hardly feel its weight in the bag. Oil is certainly a better bet than truffle chips or bits, which have very little taste.There is huge interest in the truffle market, both from honest and dishonest buyers, and it should come as no surprise.In 2010 a giant truffle was auctioned off in Macau for US$ 330,000.

Small delectable balls of chocolate became known as truffles only in the 1920s, due to their apparent resemblance to the black truffle of Southwest France, (tuber melanosporum) one of the most prized varieties. Truffles, explains the Mycological Society of San Francisco, are one of the most expensive foods in the world, selling for between $250 and $450 per pound. The real ones need to be carefully identified; they are similar in appearance to a much wider range of so-called false truffles, some of which are poisonous. Finding these treasured tubers is work beyond the abilities of humans.For the purpose of sniffing them out, female pigs are sometimes used because the smell of truffles underground resembles the smell excreted by male swine. The problem here is that after hunting down the truffles, perhaps thinking that a suitable mate is lurking in the area, pigs have a tendency to eat the truffles. For this reason, dogs \u2014 sometimes called \u201ctruffle dogs\u201d (this sounds like an elite form of a ballpark snack) are trained for the purpose. Go to the website of NW Truffle Dogs, and you\u2019ll learn that \u201cdogs can be taught new tricks,\u201d in this case tricks that might earn you $300/lb of harvested truffles if you live in the Pacific Northwest, where truffles grow naturally. After all, they remind us, \u201cTrying to fish a truffle from the mouth of a hungry hog is a treacherous task\u201d and dogs are far more amiable.The original chocolate truffle consisted of ganache, chocolate and cream, all rolled in chocolate powder. The Nibble, which specializes in specialty foods, writes that, according to lore, this concoction came about by accident in the kitchen of Auguste Escoffier, the French culinary great known for modernizing and systematizing the production of French fare. A confused kitchen apprentice, the story goes, combined hot cream with chocolate chunks instead of with the sugar and egg he had intended to pour it into, and out came a malleable paste that could be shaped into a ball. Inspired, he rolled the resulting mass in chocolate power, and, behold, before him was a brown lump that looked quite a lot like the celebrated black truffle.Technically speaking, The Nibble points out, all true truffles from that point forth have ganache in the middle, though the coating can vary. To the dismay of dessert purists, a new sort of false truffle leads unschooled consumers astray. Though the result are not poisonous, less scrupulous companies market all matter of filled chocolates as truffles, leading to a horrible Forrest Gumpian outcome. It\u2019s worth a digression here to note that the word GANACHE itself, that sine qua non of the true chocolate truffle has a rather interesting history as well. Ganache means \u201cimbecile\u201d in French. How did this come about?Chocolate-covered lore holds that it was that same luckless apprentice whose error coined the term. After incorrectly mixing his ingredients and noting the curious appearance of the resulting creation, he was called a \u201cganache\u201d by his disappointed supervisor. Only upon tasting the result did the boss deem the creation worth saving. The truffle and the ganache, it seems, were born at the same time. These stories may strain credulity, but they fit into a long tradition of stories of things created \u201cby accident,\u201d a list that, as one source compiles it, includes Coke, Teflon, Vulcanized rubber, the potato chip, penicillin, and the color mauve. The truffle is no trifle \u2014 it, and its history, are meant to be savored.  Liora Halperin is an Assistant Professor of Near Eastern Studies and Judaic Studies at Princeton.

She is known for her amazing ability to bring people together and skillfully guide them on their journey of learning herbal medicine.Rosemary is the founder of Sage Mountain Herbal Education Center, creator of International Herb Symposium, the New England Women\u2019s Herbal Conference, and author of numerous books and programs. A wonderful mix of relentless energy, deeply rooted healing power, and a unique gift of invigorating others make Rosemary very special.Rosemary was one of my first herbal teachers. The year I attended her program from April to November we\u2019d come together for a long weekend every month.Before heading back home, Rosemary would often give us \u201cZoom Balls\u201d for the road, to keep us energized and awake during a long drive. Her Zoom Balls contained guarana powder; one of the several plants known for its high caffeine content.Over the years I\u2019ve learned that you can use a variety of different herbal powders, masking them in a delicious mixture of nut butters and honey (or another sweetener like maple syrup).There are 3 reasons why learning and using this simple recipe is wise:1. Herbal truffles are easy to makeThere are very few ingredients I am listing below. Anything else you add is a plus and a great way to express your creativity!2. Herbal truffles make for a great snackHerbal truffles provide you with a healthy nutritious snack. One trick is to use a higher quality nut butter like almond, sesame, walnut, or cashew. Don\u2019t stress if you don\u2019t have these nut butters, however, a simple peanut butter will do just fine. They all contain raw, nutrient rich and bioavailable ingredients. The idea is to make them in advance (once a week or every other week). What could be better than eating a tasty herbal truffle?3. Herbal truffles are a convenient and simple way to take herbal medicinesIt\u2019s typically difficult to persuade someone to take powders (I\u2019ll discuss some alternatives with you in the future). The truffles, however, are tasty, easy to make and fun. Herbal truffles allow you to hide less pleasantly tasting ingredients.IngredientsNut butter and honey are the main ingredients. I have experimented with a variety of other ingredients.Some of my favorites include coconut oil, coconut flakes, chia seeds, chocolate chips, cocoa powder, goji berries, dried cranberries, blueberries, cherries, and even a little Himalayan salt. You can also play with dates, oats, flaxseeds, flax meal, cacao nibs, hemp seeds, vanilla and other.Some of the commonly used herbal powders include ashwagandha, guarana, turmeric, slippery elm, maca, eleuthero, shatavari, licorice, cinnamon, astragalus, medicinal mushrooms, spirulina and many others.PreparationWhen making herbal truffles, start by combining your nut butter and honey. In the following step, slowly add herbal powder, bringing the entire mixture to the consistency of dry cookie dough. Then divide the dough into small equal pieces that you can easily roll into small balls or truffles. At the end, you can sprinkle or roll the balls in the coconut flakes, cocoa or carob powder.I typically store mine in the refrigerator, they are good for a week or two. Clinical herbalists typically decide how much of herbal powder to use per batch of the truffles. Based on this they decide how many truffles to make.The only problem I usually experience with my herbal truffles, is trying not to eat the entire batch!Originally published at http://www.lanacamiel.comFound this post useful?

Truffles, little chocolate bombs of delight, are simple. They are a ganache, rolled in cocoa powder, and that\u2019s it. A ganache is a chocolate paste made with cream and whatever else you want to throw in it \u2014 simple, tasty, but not good for vegans or lactose intolerant.Oh noes! My chocolate!One of the first things you learn about chocolate is that it seizes in water and that ruins everything, possibly in the universe. Just a few drops of water can make chocolate go sticky, grainy, and crazytime useless. But, half the recipes have you adding cream and butter as soon as you melt things, both of which contain plenty of water. So what gives?Parts of chocolate are hydrophilic: the little sugar crystals, parts are hydrophobic: the cocoa butter. The cocoa powder is neutral about the whole water thing. Lecithin (the mysterious chemical ingredient to all chocolate bars) is the likes-everyone emulsifier, standing there like Rodney King looking at the rest of the ingredients saying \u201cCan\u2019t we just all get along?\u201dThere, all fixed now. WUT?The fix to seizing chocolate isn\u2019t to throw the whole thing across the kitchen and scream KHAAAAAAN! I know, I\u2019ve tried it. Instead, you have to add more water.The original chocolate is an emulsion based on solid fat crystals that can lock out water. Then you melt it, and it\u2019s based on a liquid fat emulsion. When you add water, everything goes haywire. But keep adding water and beating it with a fork, and it returns to an emulsion, this time based on the water, not the fat. Fooducation has a very good explanation of this process on down to pretty drawings of the molecules in action. A water based ganache is every bit as creamy as its cream based cousin, and if anything, slightly more chocolaty.Within moments of my first water ganache I asked one of humanity\u2019s most enduring questions: Can I do this with booze?Oh yes, yes you can.A short focal length picture: how you know we\u2019re serious about food.In this case I\u2019ve picked four liquors to make four kinds of dark chocolate truffle, as a Christmas gift to a lactose-intolerant friend. I actually needed slightly more than pictured above, but not too much. I tend to measure truffles by the \u2018that looks about right\u2019 method.You will need chocolate, cocoa powder, a microwave, water, the booze, and a willingness to get dirty hands.Basically you\u2019ll be combining these things, some after warming them.If you noticed my total lack of amounts, that\u2019s on purpose. This is a feel-as-you-go recipe. Don\u2019t worry too much about making mistakes, as even your mistakes are usually delicious.Melting chocolate made easy and non-threateningFirst you have to melt the chocolate. Many recipes will talk about gentle double boiling or warming over a mild heat and watching carefully, all of which is annoying and hard and ends in tears. We\u2019ll be microwaving our chocolate in 15 second increments.The only enemy to perfect microwave melted chocolate is the siren\u2019s call of the minute plus button. Ignore this easy button and its terrible lies. Put in 15 seconds, stir your chocolate with a fork, put in for 15 more seconds, keep stirring, until it\u2019s all uniformly melted.And there you are, perfect melty success.Microwaving Scotch?! I\u2019m mad, MAD I tell youNext you\u2019ll want to warm the booze. I put it all in the microwave at once, which was stupid, because it meant I had one that was the right temperature and three that had to be microwaved again. Ten seconds is often fine.In general, you want chocolate and whatever you are mixing into it to be what I think of as \u2018hot tub warm\u2019. Nice to the touch, but you wouldn\u2019t want to leave a child in it for more than a few minutes. This is around 104 f, 40 c. Feel free to measure it all with a thermometer, then stop because that takes too much time, and you have to just do this. Stop procrastinating.Dump your finger or so of warm booze in and start going to town with that fork.Terrifying part where the chocolate gets all clumpy and feels like it will never be smooth again.After your chocolate seizes keep putting in warm alcohol (or warm water, if you don\u2019t want the booze taste to be too strong) and keep mixing with your fork until, as if by magic\u2026It starts to smooth out! You\u2019ve deflector-dished your way out of this plot disaster in the nick of time!Once all your ganaches are smooth and silky, try them and make sure you like the balance of the chocolate and alcohol, because obviously you\u2019re going to stick this in your mouth at this point no matter what I say.Repeat three more times, and get four bowls of warm ganache.Cover your little dishes of boozy joy and let them set up in the fridge for at least an hour, more for bigger batches.From here the process from ganache to truffle is traditional, get it out of the bowl, roll it into a ball in your hand, drop it into cocoa powder, tap it on a plate to let the extra cocoa powder fall away.Lather, rinse, repeat.When you are done, your sink should look like this,And your hands should look like this.I made color-coded little booze packs!We tried them out. They were wonderful, vegan, wheat, dairy, mercury, etc free, and still full of sin. The absinthe truffles are particularly special, even to most people who don\u2019t like anise.One person complained that the Laphroaig truffles were a little too strong, but I don\u2019t really understand those words when put together that way.", "responses": 1, "tags": []}, {"title": "What impact will optimization runtimes such as TruffleRuby have on how we write Ruby code?

I want to have my cake and eat it too: I\u2019ve been using Ruby for three years and fell in love with its awesome community, expressiveness and how productive I can be when using it, but I also want the concurrency, tooling and performance I\u2019m used to from other languages.I\u2019ve picked up Ruby when I started working at Talkdesk in 2014, after several years working on the Java ecosystem. I had barely used Ruby before, I quickly fell in love with its community but I missed some of the libraries and tools I was used to from Java: great tooling for debugging, and high-quality concurrency tools. This has led me to discover and contribute to both JRuby and concurrent-ruby (among others), allowing me to have my cake and eat it too (in parallel) (really fast) (without GIL).At Talkdesk, I\u2019ve worked on the first production system that used JRuby \u2014 \u2014 with great success. Many other internal micro-services soon followed, and I\u2019ve also worked on performance analysis of these systems, including upstreaming performance improvements to our dependencies and JRuby itself.I\u2019ve recently jumped ship to Amazon, where I\u2019m working as part of the Profiler team in making tools to help Amazon\u2019s services reach kick-ass performance.London Ruby UnconferenceWelcome to the London Ruby Unconference 2017! Unconference Theme The love for Ruby and all things related to Ruby\u2026www.eventbrite.comJairo: How would you introduce your topic in an interesting fashion to a person that has (at least) a basic Ruby programming level?For a programming language such as Ruby to actually do anything on a computer, a tool needs to exist that makes it run on that computer.If you\u2019ve installed and used the Ruby command, you have used such a tool, which the community named MRI, for Matz\u2019s (Ruby\u2019s creator) Ruby Interpreter.Indeed MRI is actually not the only way of running Ruby. Historically, there have been many Ruby \u201cengines\u201d such as JRuby, Rubinius, etc that offer improved features and performance.But a new wave of Ruby engines is coming, that promises to eclipse previous attempts at making Ruby run faster and better. Yet, as always in computing, there are trade-offs to be made, and not all ways of writing Ruby are amenable to performance optimization.In this session, I would like to start a discussion on how these new engines will change how we write, think about, and deploy Ruby, and also to ask what we as part of Ruby\u2019s development community need and would like to see these engines help us provide.Jairo: What could be a nice practical application of the things someone would learn in your session?Learn about the future of Ruby enginesDiscuss Ruby programming practicesJairo: Awesome! Thanks Ivo!We have other people offering to run workshops and topics and there\u2019s still plenty of room if you wish to contribute to the Unconference. Get your ticket and optionally let us know if you would be interested in being one of the session leaders at the event.We hope to see you there!London Ruby UnconferenceWelcome to the London Ruby Unconference 2017!

But, they\u2019re used in all kinds of other industries as well. The vast majority of them work with chemical sensors that have some kind of electronically-detectable change in the presence of the specific chemical they were designed to look for. TruffleBot takes that a step further and physically \u201csniffs\u201d for a variety of compounds.TruffleBot was created by Jacob Rosenstein, who is an electrical engineer at Brown University. Rosenstein and his team were inspired by the way animals sniff out specific odors. They don\u2019t rely just on air passively moving across the odor receptors in their noses, they actively inhale that air to identify the smells they\u2019re looking for. TruffleBot works in the same way by using small air pumps to push air across its sensors.In total, TruffleBot has 16 sensors placed on a Raspberry Pi HAT. Eight of those are traditional electronic nose chemical sensors, and the other eight are mechanical digital barometers that monitor air pressure and temperature. Each chemical sensor is paired with a mechanical sensor, and the pairs are arranged in four rows of two pairs each. In testing, TruffleBot was used to analyze nine odors, and could do so with 80% accuracy using the chemical sensors alone. With the air pumps going, that jumped to 90%, and then all the way to 95% with the mechanical sensors.", "responses": 1, "tags": ["Sensors", "Raspberry Pi", "Technology", "Research", "Hardware"]}, {"title": "The Concept of Progress, Farming Truffles, and Saving Tuna: Lux Recommends #59", "post_link": "https://medium.com/lux-capital/the-concept-of-progress-farming-truffles-and-saving-tuna-lux-recommends-59-a37d0a6f064e?source=search_post", "author_name": "Editor", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@lux_capital", "publish_date": "2016-12-02", "last_modified_date": "2018-01-08", "readtime": "2.34", "claps": 5, "voters": 5, "content": "The Concept of Progress, Farming Truffles, and Saving Tuna: Lux Recommends #59EditorFollowDec 2, 2016 \u00b7 3 min readBy Sam Arbesman, PhDWelcome to Lux Recommends #59, the newest edition of what we at Lux are reading and thinking about (and want to receive this by email?

In lieu of our regular format, we will be sending our favorite segments from 2016. Happy Thanksgiving to all.IN DEPTHHunting for fintech truffles.After the root canal surgery that was the US election, we serendipitously came upon McKinsey\u2019s new fintech white paper at the same time as we were listening to a podcast on white truffle hunting in Italy and France. With respect to the McKinsey report, it\u2019s a short and sweet primer on the state of fintech today and tomorrow. Replete with a Copernicus meets Domino\u2019s Pizza graph and an understated pitch, the white paper is far preferable to the dense \u201cpunishment\u201d papers offered by some others. Its core point: 2017 will be a year of maturation that sees healthy levels of M&A, collaboration and fuzzier lines between incumbents and startups.And the truffle connection? Did you know there is no systematic way to cultivate the prized winter white truffles that grow near Alba in northern Italy and the Dr\u00f4me region of France? Sure, there are secret hunting areas and advanced ways to analyze soil data, but well capitalized and creative attempts to industrialize the magic associated with finding a white truffle have failed time and again. Similarly, while there are great banking and consulting advisors out there willing to help incumbents find a magical fintech partner or acquisition, there is no quick and easy shortcut to finding a successful solution that makes sense financially and culturally. Remember that if you find yourself at an expensive Italian or French restaurant in the coming weeks. Truffles taste great and we always want more, but getting them to the table takes lots of hard work in the dirt.Read MoreRegarding HENRYs.A major reason for SoFi\u2019s success is its customer base, which is built around HENRYs \u2014 high-earning, not rich yet millennials \u2014 who are usually great credits. While defaults on consumer loans are rising across the marketplace lending industry, SoFi\u2019s funders have the benefit of holding paper backed by top-tier borrowers. That\u2019s an advantage to keep in mind now that the company has announced a partnership with Protective Life to market term life insurance to SoFi\u2019s customers. Many affluent millennials should have life insurance but are turned off by dusty processes still prevalent in this insurance niche. On that basis alone, this deal looks like a smart one as SoFi will be adept at marketing life insurance with some much needed freshness. But the real beauty of the alliance is the low risk and price variability involved in setting rates for 30 year-old educated non-smokers who go to yoga classes and do triathlons. SoFi undoubtedly has plenty of data on its customers, too. So when you it add it up, it looks like the SoFi and Protective Life teams should be able to expedite underwriting and make the entire process far more HENRY-friendly.Read MoreIf you would like to explore marketing and partnership opportunities with The FR, please contact us here.IN BRIEFQuants are on the march\u2026\u201cFrankly, we expect to see assets move from human managers to machine managers.\u201d That\u2019s a recent comment from a well known alternative asset manager. However, the sentiment isn\u2019t coming from someone at Worldquant or Two Sigma. The author is Tony James, Chief Operating Officer of Blackstone. But as the attached article indicates, Blackstone, which has over $70 billion invested in hedge funds, has been a big backer of quant funds in recent years, even if it remains known first and foremost as an elite private equity firm.Read More\u2026But even quant funds can be disrupted.Fisher Black (of Black-Scholes fame) once commented that markets look a lot more efficient from the banks of the Charles than from the banks of the Hudson. But while there is a brainy bent to the Boston-based team at Quantopian, the crowdsourcing algo company is definitely not for theoretical types. Stocked with a fresh $25 million of capital announced this week, the company added Andreessen Horowitz to a cap table already loaded with Tier A VCs and strategic investors. With the fresh capital, this company now seems well positioned to create waves in the arcane world of quant trading.

Drivers behind the Bitcoin bull appear to be declines in China\u2019s yuan and rising demand in India on the back of Prime Minister Modi\u2019s decision to withdraw 500 and 1,000 rupee notes from circulation. Another factor may be rumors that China\u2019s large miners are ready to support larger block sizes.Read MoreDid any pollsters study the financial crisis?As this article in Quanta magazine points out, America\u2019s pollsters made the same fatal mistake many banks and hedge funds made during the financial crisis. Specifically, all of the swing state polls contained a \u201ccorrelated error\u201d much in the same way that financial analysts failed to see that individual defaults could be correlated. Practitioners of financial analysis have come a long way since the crisis; perhaps they\u2019ll find new opportunities to share (i.e., sell) their expertise to a still-shocked polling industry.

We made tons of chocolate truffles and I\u2019ll be covering the differences and variety.Boxes of Chocolate TrufflesEach Chocolate truffle is different but the process of making any truffle follows the same set of steps:Make a ganache filling: tempered chocolate + liquids + fats + flavour ingredients. The ratio of chocolate : everything else determines the truffle filling texture (loose/runny vs. stiff/solid).Chill ganache filling: allow filling to cool in containers that\u2019ll help the shaping phase. (e.g. large sheets for squares, scooplable container for rounds, etc)Shape ganache filling: e.g. scoop and roll to shape rounds, pipe kisses & lollipops as kisses, cut from chilled sheets for squares, etc.Coat fillings: temper white/milk/dark chocolate and dip shaped ganache using specialized chocolate dipping forks or using your hands. Let rest on acetate sheets for a glossy bottom.Decorate: e.g. apply template on top, add lollipop cane, cover in edible glitter, sprinkle salt, etc.Irish Cream GanacheThese Whiskey Truffles were the first truffles I made so I\u2019l talk about these first. The Irishcream Ganache is a mix of 8:1 milk:dark melted chocolate, cream, whiskey, coffee extract and honey. They were shaped as squares, dipped in tempered milk chocolate and applied the pattern above (like a sticker). These tasted super boozy to me.Kaffir Lime White Chocolate TrufflesThese Kaffir Lime White Chocolate Truffles had cream and glucose infused with kaffir lime leaves and mixed in with 8:1 melted white chocolate : cocoa butter. They were then scooped out using a small cookie scoop, rolled, hand rolled in tempered white chocolate and sprinkled with edible silver glitter.Infused Truffles can be infused with anything: basil, kaffir lime, lemongrass, etc. Anytime there\u2019s a liquid or fat infusions can happen.Earl Grey LollipopsThese Earl Grey Lollipops had cream infused with Earl Grey tea, and then mixed with 3:1 65%:38% chocolate mixture and butter. They were then piped as kisses, dipped in chocolate, placed on the pattern and had a lollipop stick placed in them. Again with Infused Ganaches we can infuse any flavour into the cream.Raspberry White Chocolate LollipsThese Raspberry White Chocolate Ganache is a 3:1:1 mix of melted white chocolate : heated cream : fruit puree. It was then cooled, scooped, rolled, had the lollipop stick inserted, dipped in tempered white chocolate and placed on the pattern to cool. Flavored Ganaches are super interesting because we can substitute the raspberry puree for many other things.Mojito White Chocolate TrufflesThis White Chocolate Mojito Ganache is a simple 1:2 mix of cream infused with mint : melted white chocolate and a bit of rum. They were then chilled, scooped, rolled, hand rolled in tempered white chocolate and sprinkled with edible green glitter combined with alcohol. Again with Infused Ganaches and Flavored Ganaches we could have substituted the mint and rum for almost anything.Raspberry Guanaja TrufflesThis Raspberry Ganache has a 4:2:1 mix of melted Velrune Guanaja 70% chocolate : raspberry puree : butter. The ganache was then chilled, scooped, rolled, dipped in high percentage milk chocolate and sprinkled with ground up freeze-dried raspberry. They were incredibly raspberry in flavour.Salted Caramel TrufflesThis Salted Caramel Ganache is a mixture of medium-colored caramel, heated cream, milk chocolate and butter. It was then chilled, scooped, rolled, dipped in tempered milk chocolate and sprinkled with fleur de sal salt.Dulce De Leche TrufflesThe Dulce De Leche Ganache has Dulce De Leche (simmered milk+sugar that\u2019s caramelized), coffee infused cream, melted white chocolate and irish cream liqueur.Assembling Dulce De Leche Bonbons: piping in dulce de leche ganacheThe assembly of the Dulce De Leche Truffles is super interesting. First, we used premade bonbon shells. We then filled them halfway with the dulce de leche ganache, then irish cream ganache and finally closed the hole opening with tempered dark chocolate. Then the entire bonbon got dipped in tempered chocolate.I keep saying tempered chocolate in this post like it\u2019s no big thing to temper chocolate when I\u2019ve failed at that a lot. The process we learned at school this week makes a lot of sense to me:Heat chocolate over baine marie to 115\u00b0F (specifically 113\u00b0F for dark chocolate, 104\u00b0F for white/milk chocolate)Take off baine marie and slowly seed unmelted tempered chocolate. Aggressively agitate with a rubber spatula.Goal temperature is 87\u00b0F for white/milk chocolate and 86\u00b0F-90\u00b0F for dark chocolate.When within 2\u00b0F of the aforementioned goal temperature stop adding large chunks of unmelted chocolate and instead microplane in tempered chocolate. Keep agitating.Dip a test parchment paper strip or knife, let cool and and see if the chocolate is glossy tempered.MendiantsTo make Mendiants we spooned tempered dark chocolate into rounds on acetate sheets (for a glossy bottom) and covered with chopped dried fruit, nuts and glitter.Peanut Butter CupsThese delicious peanut butter cups are another great example of using tempered chocolate. The first layer is tempered white chocolate, peanut butter and feuilletine (crushed crepes). It\u2019s piped into these adorable tiny cups, chilled and then covered with a thin layer of tempered dark chocolate sprinkled with roasted ground peanuts.Chocolate TastingWe started this week by tasting different kinds of chocolate and taking aggressive notes. For me the most important thing I learned is that my preference away from strong bitter taste stirs me towards milk chocolate.Read more about my adventures in pastry school by reading about last week:Pastry Chef School: Creme Puffs, Eclairs, Creme Brulee, FlanThis week in pastry school we baked off Choux pastry, decorated eclairs & cream puffs, tasted our custards from last\u2026medium.com", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Food", "Cooking", "Baking", "Recipe", "Chocolate"]}, {"title": "Are Truffles Getting Harder to Find?", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@macfound/are-truffles-getting-harder-to-find-7d1506d5c02a?source=search_post", "author_name": "MacArthur Foundation", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@macfound", "publish_date": "2018-09-25", "last_modified_date": "2018-09-25", "readtime": "3.29", "claps": 1, "voters": 1, "content": "Are Truffles Getting Harder to Find?MacArthur FoundationFollowSep 25, 2018 \u00b7 4 min readHow Technology is Changing the Search for MacArthur FellowsBy Cecilia Conrad, Managing Director, MacArthur Fellows ProgramThe search for highly creative individuals who become MacArthur Fellows was once called a \u201ctruffle hunt\u201d in recognition of their rarity and the talent required to recognize them. For some, the archetype of a MacArthur Fellow is the brilliant yet unknown artist or the lone-wolf scientist, such as paleontologist Jack Horner who had neither a college degree nor an academic affiliation when named a Fellow. Recently, we have heard frustration that lone-wolf scientists no longer exist or that all the truly creative people are already richly rewarded. Some question whether truffles still exist. Is this nostalgia for the \u201cgood ole days\u201d or is it more difficult to uncover the true \u201csurprise\u201d or maverick today than it was 20 years ago? We have tweaked our selection process to adjust to changes in technology, but the path to becoming a MacArthur Fellow then and now begins with a submission from an invited nominator whose identity remains a secret. Twenty years ago, this was a very small cadre of rotating nominators, but today, with the availability of email, we have a larger and more diverse network across the country. Perhaps these changes have contributed to the increased representation of women among MacArthur Fellows. Technology has also made it easier to research and follow the work of a potential Fellow at a distance. Although we still conduct in-person reconnaissance, we can frequently watch a nominee\u2019s talk or performance on YouTube. The program has always relied on peer reviews, and we continue to consult external experts in the Fellow\u2019s field and from adjacent disciplines. Though peer reviews are critical to our assessment of both quality and innovativeness, research has shown that peer reviews can be biased against truly novel ideas. One reason may be the technology-enabled, easy access to bibliometric indicators, such as citation counts, that can also introduce bias and obscure the truly creative researchers in our midst. In a recent article in Research Policy, Wang, Veugelers, and Stephan report that novel papers tend to appear in less frequently cited journals and to have their long-term significance understated by short-term indicators. Technology has also made it harder to be a lone wolf. The modern scientist in nearly every field uses expensive, sophisticated technologies unavailable to the lone wolf. In the past, both a university-based scholar and an independent scholar had to trek to a library to read a journal article. Now, most university-based scholars have access to nearly every published work through their desktop computers. The Jack Horner of today often needs tools almost exclusively available through large institutions. Although scientists have always worked in teams, the size of those teams is increasing. This phenomenon, called \u201cbig science,\u201d has, at times, made it difficult to disentangle the individual creativity we seek to identify and support. To offset these biases against novelty and individual creativity, our selection process avoids overreliance on traditional metrics and supplements peer reviews with reviews from outside the nominee\u2019s immediate field of work. A highly interdisciplinary selection committee makes the ultimate recommendation. We mitigate the risk aversion of both reviewers and selectors through anonymity. And we continuously reevaluate our definition of creativity to capture wherever it might appear, from filmmaking to farming to financial services and beyond. It might be harder to dig up truffles, but we are still finding them\u2013highly creative individuals largely unknown outside a small community or narrow field of study. Ornithologist M. Philip Kahl, an independent field biologist and a world authority on African storks, was named a Fellow in 1988, as was Pamela Long in 2014, a historian of science and technology without an academic affiliation, who is a specialist in late medieval and Renaissance societies. Our truffle hunters identified Mississippi lawyer, poet, and activist Billie Jean Young in 1984 and John Henneberger, a fair and affordable housing advocate based in Austin, Texas, in 2014. Even individuals working in large, collaborative research groups have been singled out by their peers as exceptionally pioneering, such as quantum astrophysicist Nergis Mavalvala, who was recognized in 2010 for her innovative work in optics that aid in the detection of gravitational radiation. Not every MacArthur Fellow will be a lone wolf or a starving artist, and many will have already achieved some recognition. With advances in technology, we have adapted the way in which we look for creativity wherever it might be, and we are convinced that truffles still exist. When we announce the newest MacArthur Fellows in early October, our goal will still be to celebrate the depth and breadth of American creativity, to uplift those among us who are truly exceptional, and to remind us all that the power to create is part of our shared humanity.This story first appeared on the MacArthur Foundation website.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Science", "Macarthur Fellows", "Genius Grant", "Genius", "Creativity"]}, {"title": "Drink a Bellini in a Monastery, Forage for Truffles in the Woods", "post_link": "https://medium.com/the-fathom-collection/drink-a-bellini-in-a-monastery-forage-for-truffles-in-the-woods-cfd9e66249ae?source=search_post", "author_name": "Fathom", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@fathomwaytogo", "publish_date": "2014-11-14", "last_modified_date": "2017-06-15", "readtime": "3.23", "claps": 1, "voters": 1, "content": "The forager and his truffle dogs.

The grand hilltop hotel has a facade attributed to Michelangelo, spacious suites tucked into terraced gardens, and a calm, meditative atmosphere befitting its 600-year-old bones. I\u2019m having lunch with a friend on the veranda overlooking rows of slender Tuscan cypress trees, the city of Florence, and its giant, gleaming Duomo. The view is out of this world. Those Byzantine monks sure knew how to secure the best views.We\u2019re in town for a friend\u2019s wedding and decide to make it one long splurge of a week. That\u2019s why I say certamente every time the elegant waiter asks if I\u2019d like more bellini, more wine, more pecorino, more espresso, more petit fours.

The Tuscan town is obsessed with the pungent root, so much so that they host a three-week-long truffle fair every November (the most fruitful time for hunting and eating).The hotel works with Entro Terra, a local touristic outfit, to arrange outings with a licensed forager (and, if necessary, a translator). We jump in a car and head for the hills about 45 minutes away.When we meet Giampiero, he\u2019s wearing camouflage and holding a wooden tool made specifically for digging truffles. He has a sly smile, shiny hair, and a quiet demeanor. For the rest of the afternoon, we refer to him as the Silver Fox. Two truffle dogs named Tiago and Biagio run like crazy in circles around him. They know they\u2019re about to play a game and they are very excited about itWe\u2019re looking for the elusive white truffle (tuber magnatum pico) of the San Miniato Hills. Referred to as the Food of Kings, they are considered to be one of the most precious varieties. The dogs are trained off the aroma of the tuber \u2014 they go nuts sniffing around the wooded hills as the Silver Fox makes note of the temperature, humidity, and outcropping of oak trees where truffles usually hide. It\u2019s September, so chances are slim that we\u2019ll come across any, but it\u2019s good exercise for the dogs (not to mention us). The Silver Fox tests his pets by taking a truffle from his pocket and burying it in the ground. He whistles for their attention, and the dogs know the game is on. They\u2019re off in a mad dash, sniffing and racing until one of them locates the trifola. Dog treats and big pats all around.This is Italy, so the forager is, of course, also a philosopher cook, and the Silver Fox takes his time explaining the spiritual properties of quiet walks in the woods before insisting that the best preparation for white truffles is shaving them over fresh spaghetti.We don\u2019t disagree. It\u2019s been two hours or maybe even three since our last snack, a serious offense in Tuscany. We bid farewell and make our way back to Florence to resume our truffle hunt inside a cozy trattoria.PLAN YOUR TRIPBelmond Villa San MicheleVia Doccia, 4Fiesole Firenze, Italy 50014+39\u2013055\u2013567\u20138200We caught the hotel\u2019s complimentary shuttle service from Florence\u2019s Piazza della Repubblica to Belmond Villa San Michele.

Redolent of farm and dank, fecund dirt, the veined black fungi are shaved with abandon onto vegetables, fish, bird, meat, pasta and grain; its uber-dark essence even wound into gelato. Unlike the lascivious aroma of the white truffle, which evaporates like a ghost when heated, the black does not squander its scent when warmed, but instead reveals greater intensity. While France claims 45% of the world\u2019s production of black truffles, we found ourselves just across its border in northern Italy\u2019s Piedmont region, where a smaller percentage of the gnarled black orbs are harvested.But no poor Italian relations are those magical nuggets.Italian haute cuisine in my childhood meant platters of Grandmother Turbina\u2019s enormous stuffed shells, each fat envelope an entire meal, its seam bursting open with an alchemistical ricotta covered in a barely cooked, Modigliani red tomato sauce, and studded with Brando-sized fingers of spicy pork sausage. My people arrived from towns further south in the boot, where rustic foods served in hearty proportions prevailed.The refinements of northern Italy\u2019s Piedmont region are even further from the southern Campania province than the miles between them might suggest. Piedmont\u2019s studied delicacy is encapsulated in the agnolotti, a tiny pasta stuffed with meat. Instead of mounding spoonful\u2019s of filling onto a sheet of pasta, covering it with another layer, and cutting and sealing the two sheaths (producing the beloved ravioli square of my youth), each agnolotto is simply folded over the filling into either a small square or half-moon shape.Laboriously produced by hand, these tiny parcels of meat can also be made in a smaller rectangular shape, referred to as \u2018Agnolotti al Plin\u2019. \u2018Plin\u2019, meaning \u2018pinch\u2019 in a distant Piedmontese dialect, are closed between the thumb and forefinger, sealing together the ends. If prepared correctly, agnolotti should resemble the indented hat of a Roman Catholic pope or priest.The pasta is boiled in salty water until tender and served en brodo, (the broth made from the same animal as the stuffing), or dressed lightly with butter and sage. As tradition dictates no cheese in the filling, the agnolotti are finished with a grating of Parmigiano-Reggiano shaved from a fist-sized block.Ancient history pervades everyday Italian life. The word agnolotti is mentioned in a tome dating to the 12th century, describing a Piemontese farmer who tried to please his boss by showering him with fresh vegetables and a precise number of agnolotti.Legend has it these little pasta purses were named after their creator, Angelot (n\u00e9e Angiolino), who cooked for an important Marquis. To celebrate the end of one of Italy\u2019s many sieges, this nobleman wanted a special dinner, but the war had left the larder bare. His industrious chef made a stuffing from leftover meats, and tucked it into dough made from egg and flour. The ancient spelling, still found today, is piat d\u2019angelot or angelotti.Given that it\u2019s Italy, home to the hand gesture and honking horn, the more course explanation of the word agnolotti is anus ring (hailing from the Latin variant of anellotto, which is equivalent to anell (o) ring or the Latin \u0101nellus, a diminutive of \u0101nus ring). And while an argument can certainly be made for this similitude, I\u2019ll always prefer to think of agnolotti as resembling a priest\u2019s hat.Dozens of ladybugs flittered on the window of a dining room perched high on a hill in the ancient town La Morra, but these little harbingers of good luck couldn\u2019t obscure the view of the valleys stretched out before us. The famed vineyards of Barolo and Barbaresco, so well represented on the wine list through which I now paged, were splayed out below; world-class Nebbiolo grapes planted alongside vines growing age-worthy Barbera and Dolcetto. Lush vegetable plots were situated next to orchards of hazelnuts, their earthy-sweet yield lightly toasted and a common ingredient in the region\u2019s cakes and cookies. Honeybee boxes peppered the valleys, blessing the entire poly-culture, and etched into the hills are the tiny back roads, or localitas, which thread each patchwork together into an elegant quilt that is the Langhe.Eyeing the massive cheese cart displayed by the front door, I ordered lunch with unusual restraint. Traditionalists, of which there are many in Italy, dictate the cheese be local and served post-meal, and the agnolotti be stuffed with meat, preferably leftover from Sunday\u2019s lunch. But in the more progressive kitchens of Piedmont, agnolotti are often filled with flavors of the season. While Altare\u2019s Arborina Barolo took a bit of air before taking its flight, the chef\u2019s heretical interpretation of an Italian spring was set before me: a dozen thin-skinned agnolotti stuffed with Sairass del Fieno, a Piedmontese cheese made with sheep\u2019s milk and a bit of cow\u2019s cream, nestled in a light butter sauce made from the milk of said bovine, and sprinkled with electric-blue, wild borage flowers.Escaping the city for a languid lunch, exquisitely dressed Milanese men whispered to their mistresses, while lightly stroking fingers, and a married couple sat solemnly, discussing the food. An old man, dining alone in suit and tie, watched as a table of drunken Portuguese diners tried to smuggle out a crystal wine decanter. As the late afternoon sun shone through the heavy winter clouds, soon ferrying snow from the Alps, I was struck at the ease with which Italian daily life imitates high art.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Food", "Travel", "Foodies"]}, {"title": "These PROTEIN Chocolate Truffles Basically Make Themselves", "post_link": "https://medium.com/the-bloq/these-protein-chocolate-truffles-basically-make-themselves-e50923292ab2?source=search_post", "author_name": "Quest Nutrition", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@QuestNutrition", "publish_date": "2016-07-14", "last_modified_date": "2018-04-10", "readtime": "1.93", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "These PROTEIN Chocolate Truffles Basically Make ThemselvesLet your gym buddies think you\u2019re a culinary mastermind.Quest NutritionFollowJul 14, 2016 \u00b7 2 min readSOMETIMES THE WEEK CAN MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE:THANKFULLY, THESE PROTEIN CHOCOLATE TRUFFLES ARE A SNAP TO MAKEALL YOU DO IS A LITTLE BIT OF THIS:ADD A TINY BIT OF THIS:AND THEN YOU GET TO DO THIS:NOW KICK BACK, UNWIND AND LET US SHOW YOU HOW IT\u2019S MADENUTRITIONAL INFO (RECIPE CREATED BY JOE CASTRO)CHOCOLATE PROTEIN TRUFFLESYields: 6 servings | Serving Size: 1 TurtleCalories: 130 | Protein: 12g | Fat: 3g | Net Carb: 8g (0g sugar)Fiber: 3g | Total Carb: 16g | P/CAL: 37%Prep Time: 10 min | Cook Time: 3 min | Total Time: 35 min[ingredients title=\u201dIngredients\u201d]FILLING1 Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Quest Bar\u00ae2 scoops Quest\u00ae Vanilla Milkshake Protein Powder2 tablespoons unsweetened almond milk2 tablespoons zero-calorie sweetener5 tablespoons sugar-free chocolate chipsNonstick cooking spray1 tablespoon pecans, chopped[/ingredients][directions title=\u201dMethod\u201d]1.

Today we are celebrating Oregon with Luscious Oregon Hazelnut Truffles.See what your states\u2019s recipe is by searching #50FoodsRecipe for Luscious Hazelnut Truffles. The longer that hazelnuts are toasted, the sweeter they will be, and the better foil for bittersweet chocolate. There\u2019s nothing difficult about these truffles. They are supposed to be irregularly shaped; their roughness is part of their charm.Ingredients1 1/4 cups heavy creamPinch of salt12 ounces bittersweet or semisweetchocolate, finely chopped1 cup hazelnut pieces1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powderInstructionsIn a saucepan over medium heat, bring the cream and salt just to a boil.Remove the pan from the heat, add the chocolate and whisk until smooth.Pour the mixture into a bowl and let cool to room temperature, then cover and refrigerate until firm, 2 to 3 hours.Meanwhile, preheat an oven to 350\u00b0F.Put the hazelnuts on a baking sheet and toast in the oven until dark golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Let cool completely, then finely chop and place in a shallow bowl.Place the cocoa in another shallow bowl. Working quickly, roll a rounded measuring teaspoon of the chocolate mixture into a 1-inch ball in your hands, then roll in the hazelnuts, pressing them lightly into the truffle, lightly coat with the cocoa and set on a tray. Repeat with the remaining truffle mixture, hazelnuts and cocoa.Store between layers of waxed paper in an airtight container in the refrigerator until ready to serve, up to 1 week. Let the truffles stand at room temperature for about 15 minutes before serving. Makes 5 dozen truffles.TIP: This is a very flexible recipe. Use any nut you\u2019d like instead of hazelnuts or coat the truffles with something else entirely \u2014 large clear sugar crystals, finely crushed graham crackers or crushed hard peppermint candies would all be terrific. Or just use the cocoa without nuts. Add a tablespoon or so of your favorite liqueur to the chocolate ganache, or use Cognac or other brandy or rum. If it pleases you, add instant espresso powder or replace some of the cream with mascarpone.You could also add minced dried tart cherries, a pinch of cinnamon or nutmeg, finely chopped fresh lemon or orange zest, or minced crystallized ginger. You can even steep Earl Gray tea, spices such as saffron or cardamom, or herbs (try rosemary or lemon verbena) in the cream to flavor it; strain and reheat gently before adding the chocolate.Originally published at www.foodchannel.com.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Recipe", "Food", "50foods", "Oregon", "Chocolate"]}, {"title": "How Kung Fu Fighting, Truffles, And A Piece Of Ham Can Teach Us All We Need To Know About Making Vast Amounts Of Money", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@danraine/how-kung-fu-fighting-truffles-and-a-piece-of-ham-can-teach-us-all-we-need-to-know-about-making-c03a361ee3ae?source=search_post", "author_name": "Dan Raine", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@danraine", "publish_date": "2019-01-18", "last_modified_date": "2019-01-18", "readtime": "9.52", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "How Kung Fu Fighting, Truffles, And A Piece Of Ham Can Teach Us All We Need To Know About Making Vast Amounts Of MoneyDan RaineFollowJan 18 \u00b7 10 min read\u201cIf you want to be successful, look at what everybodyelse is doing and do the opposite.\u201d \u2014 Zig ZiglarI was invited to talk at a dinner the other night. It was for a mixed age range audience of entrepreneurs (both startups and established companies).I don\u2019t usually do these kind of things, primarily because I wasn\u2019t getting paid for it, it was a pain in the ass to get to, it was on a night I had already made plans for, oh yes, and did I mention that I wasn\u2019t getting paid for it?But it was for one of my coaching clients who I have become friends with over the past couple of years and he has put close to $30,000 in my pocket so I felt obliged to attend.So here I am in a room full of people all in small to medium-sized businesses. I knew a couple of faces and there were also a couple of my other coaching clients there too.Now I had planned to talk about email marketing and how to craft emails that get opened and read, but I thought I would get to know my audience a little so that I could personalize it to them.\u201cSo, what do you do?\u201d I asked one guy at the front. \u201cI sell discount lamb online.\u201d\u201cJust lamb?\u201d I asked, he said \u201cNo, I sell cheese and other farm produce cheaper than most people online.\u201dI asked how business was and he said it covers costs\u2026 interesting.The next guy I asked ran a martial arts studio which offered unlimited lessons and access to his training center for \u00a315 a month. I also asked how he was doing and he said that he couldn\u2019t take on any more customers because the place was too busy.I said excellent, but he didn\u2019t look too pleased.He went on to say that with the rent rates, staff costs, and the fact that he was working 6 days a week he was now losing money on the place but for some reason was also looking to open up a second center so he could take on more people.Now I don\u2019t want to bore you here with stories but that night I asked about ten people what they did and they all had something in common.Discounts.They were all basing their businesses on being the cheapest, which is the fastest route to nothing you can take.Now I understand why people do this, we have just been through one of our longest recessions (and after brexit I am pretty much sure that the UK is swiftly heading into another one), you want to price for the market.But that is exactly the problem. You are in the wrong market. There has never been a greater time to sell to the wealthy than today.There are 34 million millionaires in the world, 15 million of those live in the US.7% of the American population earn $100,000 or more, and 17% of all US households bring in $100,000 or more combined.Now $100,000 may no longer be the \u2018ideal number\u2019 it once was in terms of satisfaction with their income, but those people still have plenty of disposable cash to pay for the finer things in life, or to upgrade their experience.Now I singled out those two businesses above for a reason. Let\u2019s take a look at the martial arts center.I have a client in the exact same businesses. He is a mixed martial arts instructor qualified in just about everything.His first job when he was a kid was a caddy at a local golf club. He then took lessons, and finally became an instructor where he had his first taste of success taking on private clients.His passion though was martial arts, and had been involved in one form or another since the age of 4.At the grand old age of 32 he quit golf and decided to start up a martial arts school and sunk every penny he earned into that businesses, it lasted just over a year.Why?For the exact same reason as the other guy \u2014 plenty of customers who were paying too little.He charged \u00a35 a lesson, and half that for kids under 12.This is to be taught by a guy who had spent 28 years of his life mastering his craft, building his skills, and becoming an absolute expert in his field.So why was he charging so little?Because everyone else was.And that\u2019s why I have included the Zig Ziglar quote at the top of the article as a reminder of one of the most important lessons you can learn.So anyhoo, I met this guy at one of the San Diego events Ed and I ran a few years back, he actually lived not too far from me back in the UK, and he became one of my early group of clients.He decided he wanted to have another go at making this work.Now I am no health freak, I don\u2019t do martial arts, but I do know about the business.A friend of mine pays \u00a320 a lesson with 20 other people for his training. that\u2019s \u00a3400 for an hour and a half of work.That\u2019s way better than what my friend was earning when he was charging \u00a35 and \u00a32.50 for kids.I also know another martial arts teacher who is in a Platinum mastermind which I am part of, and he has shared with our group a lot of how his business worked so we put together a plan.First off was location.His first center was setup in a relatively poor area with a lot of competition in the cheap price range.Now we all know the affluent areas around us, and we looked at half a dozen places and tallied the martial arts clubs and grabbed their pricing.One place stood out, it was a wealthy area, had a very high priced gym, a rather expensive school, and just one martial arts club charging peanuts.Perfect.Next was pricing, and just like a gym membership he setup a monthly subscription where you could attend 1, 2, 4, or unlimited lessons a month.You could go for 1 trial lesson only and that was free to see if it was for you, but only one, and you couldn\u2019t pay for individual lessons if you decided you wanted more than your subscription, you had to upgrade.He also offered exclusive lessons, either individually, or in groups of no more than three.Right from day one this was positioned as high-end.He also made one big change. In the past he would teach a variety of martial arts adding more and more skills as customers asked for it\u2026 diluting his core teaching.He taught just two things, Muay Thai, and street fighting.He also hired a full-time sales guy who had been a member of his previous club.is was the best decision he had made.He had resisted this at first because he thought his uber friendly style would get people to signup but he was an awful salesman who didn\u2019t like to put people under pressure.So like I said, this was premium right from the beginning, from the meet and greets and the trial sessions which he would do without a load of other more advanced students in the room (it intimidates people), to the marketing information, follow-up welcome calls to stop buyer remorse. He built an instant concierge style relationship with his customers.Most of his customers started either on the two session a month plan for \u00a340 a month or his unlimited sessions for \u00a390.His numbers showed that after three months over half the two session group had upgraded to four sessions or gone to unlimited.Not so surprising was the fact that the unlimited users rarely came to more than three sessions. they paid more because it was an option.Now where his business really took off was his \u2018exclusive\u2019 sessions. \u00a3200 got you one-on-one with him, and \u00a3100 for up to a group of three.A lot of his exclusive customers were businessmen who wanted to learn street skills, a fair few footballers who wanted to learn Muay Thai, and once they started talking, his unlimited sessions subscriptions were taken up by their kids.Great customer service generated amazing word of mouth and he has built a great business around this.Not once in the entire start-up time did he offer a discount.A lot of gym\u2019s go, \u201cIf you sign-up today at your trial session then you get 25% off!\u201d etc. He didn\u2019t need to do that. Instead, he used one simple trick.He bought a huge 60 inch T.V. and put it right in the entrance it showed the number of spots available. Scarcity at its best.After a few months he had filled the spots. He expanded into the building next door and took on two more instructors, now the sign shows each instructor and how many spots they have available.It\u2019s almost three years on now since he started, and I went to meet him a month ago, that sign has three zero\u2019s on it and he has a waiting list of over a hundred names.Now that is exclusivity.One final point is his retention rate. He loses just 2% of his members a month, and those are usually in the first three months. He has managed to attract the type of customer that doesn\u2019t mind spending \u00a390 a month even if they don\u2019t use it every month (remember this is not just a hobby, it\u2019s not a fitness class, they are paying to learn a skill).Finally, I just wanted to say he has added to his income by selling high-end sports gear and equipment and has now set up a specialist studio which films from multiple angles so he can use it with his high-end customers to show them how they are doing, and where they can improve. These sessions cost \u00a3500 for two hours and he does at least five of these a week.Now I want to share with you one more case study.Two years ago I was at a wedding of a friend and met a guy who was working there slicing ham. Nothing unusual I hear you say. But what if I told you he earns up to \u00a32,000 a day slicing that ham?I shit you not.This was his full time job. Once or twice a week he would attend a wedding or corporate event and slice ham.Now, this is not your usual ham, and he is far from the average server. The ham he slices is probably the best ham in the world. It is ib\u00e9rico de bellota, which comes from a pure breed pig fed on acorns.When I lived in Madrid I was addicted to the stuff.So why does he get paid so well?Slicing the ham so thinly and in small inch square pieces is an art form and the actual ham doesn\u2019t come cheap and he was using was the best I had ever tasted.Which is why I got speaking to him. I wanted to know where he got it from.Boy did he take some persuading. I basically harassed him for several hours until he gave in and gave me his suppliers name.Now ever since coming back from Madrid, I have bought one of these hams every year for Christmas, they usually cost me around \u00a3300, but they are still never as good as the ham I used to buy over there.So I contacted the guy and it turns out his business is based in Liverpool, we got chatting and he invited me over to come and pick one up and an unlikely friendship was born.His name is Grange and he is a scouser through and through, and he runs a food importing business which only normally sells to the trade.What\u2019s interesting about Grange is that he got started by buying truffles. He was at 25, a trained car mechanic who wanted a change in career. He wanted to work for himself but not as a mechanic, he wanted something he could go big on.The question he asked himself is \u201cWhat is the most expensive thing I can buy with the money I have that I can sell over and over again?\u201dis was six years ago, four years before I met him.He did some Googling on the most expensive foods and came up with truffles and Wasabi. Wasabi pound for pound is one of the most expensive crops in the world, but he was naturally drawn to truffles.So he did his research, took his money, and drove to France.For about three weeks he drove around France meeting people, finding suppliers, farmers, casual truffle hunters in the area and at the end of his trip bought and came back with a small box of truffles worth about \u00a34,000 at retail value, he paid around \u00a32,500.But what he did next would be the real start of his business, he took those truffles the same day around every top London hotel, asked to see the Chef, and sold them all\u2026\u2026 for more than retail value, over \u00a35,000 to be precise.He had bought the best truffles at the very start of the season, and Chefs loved them. A valuable lesson in quality was learned.What he did next will come as no surprise. He went down his list of expensive foods, saw the ham, and went on a trip to Spain.Now the ham I bought from him and have continued to buy from him is without a doubt the best quality money can buy. It costs around \u00a3500. I still don\u2019t know how much he pays for them but I do know he sells around 50 a week to hotels and restaurants.Thats a pretty good income, and I am sure he is making a decent margin. He does lots of expensive food now too.The point here is that he doesn\u2019t have to negotiate price, he has good quality products and customers who will pay for that. He started with the right frame of mind\u2026What is the most expensive thing that I can sell?If you like this article and want to read more like it then take a look at The Raine Report.Originally published at danraine.com on January 18, 2019.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Marketing", "Startup", "Startup Lessons", "Business"]}, {"title": "Pastry Chef School: Painting Truffles, Making Lollipops & Caramels", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@justinangel/pastry-chef-school-painting-truffles-making-lollipops-caramels-80dd182834a5?source=search_post", "author_name": "Justin Angel", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@justinangel", "publish_date": "2018-04-17", "last_modified_date": "2018-04-17", "readtime": "3.67", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "Pastry Chef School: Painting Truffles, Making Lollipops & CaramelsJustin AngelFollowApr 17, 2018 \u00b7 4 min readHand painted & sprayed chocolate truffles (left); me molding chocolate truffles (right)This week in Pastry School we painted chocolate truffles and started making sugar confections like marshmallows, caramels, dragees and lollipops.Spray Painted Chocolate TrufflesI Spray Painted these Chocolate Truffles over at Feve Chocolates. To paint chocolate truffles with that beautiful glossy finish we mixed special colours with cocoa butter and sprayed those with an air compressor.What\u2019s special about cocoa butter colours? Most of these colours have titanium dioxide which gives that glossy finish. If cocoa butter colours don\u2019t contain titanium dioxide then it\u2019s best to add a contrast layer of a colour that does have that as a background layer.How to spray paint a single colour truffle (e.g. the yellow shapes above)? Temper cocoa butter colors to 80\u201385\u00b0F, load into chocolate sprayer gun, spray molds side-to-side, spray molds up & down and let cool in room temp. Once the cocoa butter sets: fill with tempered chocolate, knock sides to remove air bubbles, flip over to remove excess chocolate, tap sides until excess chocolate stops dripping, cool in room temp and cool in fridge until shells come loss. Now you\u2019re ready to pipe and cap.How to spray paint with two colours? Apply the first color with one fluid motion either by hand painting with your finger, or a brush, or dab some colour from a sponge. Once set, spray paint the other color on. e.g. I painted the green above with a brush, brush-sprayed green dots and then spray painted black.Spray painted chocolate trufflesThere are tons of other techniques for spray painting cocoa butter colours.Painter\u2019s tape (e.g. bottom left yellow stripes): add painters to cover up a part of the mold. Do your first design. Remove the painter\u2019s tape and spray the second design.Brush galaxy spray (e.g. bottom right blue dots): with a flat headed brush spray dots into the mold and then spray background colour.Wet-on-wet (e.g red and purple center): dual wielding two air compressors chocolate guns with different colours, spray a dot directly in the center and while wet spray the second colour in to disprese the first colour.Toothpick (e.g. top left line in red lemons): Spray paint a colour, let cool, with a toothpick make a design in it and then spray paint another colour.These Saffron Lollipops are so unique. The actual lollipop is saffron-ginger-sugar, glucose and pear liquor heated up to 300\u00b0F. We then fill lollipop molds halfway, put a few strands of saffron and fill the other half of the lollipop mold. It looks like beautiful crystalized saffron and tastes really distinct.Caramel CandiesThis week we also made all of these Caramels. All of these were made by heating up sugar mixtures with butter/cream to 240\u00b0F-252\u00b0F. The higher the temp, the richer the colour and stronger the caramel flavour.Each Caramel had different ingredients, ratios, techniques and ultimately different flavours and textures:Passion Fruit Caramels had 3:2:1 ratio of sugar : cream : passion-fruit-puree. They ended up pretty soft and delicious.Kalamansi Caramels had a 4:4:1:1 ratio of sugar : chocolate : citrus puree : butter.Raspberry Caramels had raspberry puree, fresh raspberries and IQF (Individually quickly frozen) raspberries which made for beautiful seeds in the caramels.Black Pepper and Bourbon caramels had a 1:1 ratio of sugars:cream with a tiny bit of black pepper and bourbon for seasoning. They ended up super soft.Hazelnut and Almond DrageesFinally these week we made Hazelnut and Almonds Dragees. Like Julie said in class \u201cI\u2019m used to seeing these at weddings\u201d. These were better then the ones I normally got at weddings. A Dragee is a hard nut caramel coated, triple coated in chocolate and then dusted with cocoa powder. Commercially made dragees are smoothed out by tumbling them in large drums.How do you caramel coat hard nuts? melt sugar with a tiny bit of water in large pan. once 230\u00b0F, remove from heat, add nuts and agitate with hard spatula until sugar is completely crystallized. Put back on heat and keep agitating until the darkest caramel forms.Read more about my adventures in pastry school by reading about last week\u2019s cookies and strudels:Pastry Chef School: Cookies and StrudelThis week in SF Cooking School Pastry School we baked strudels & dozens of cookies, and shipped those in pastry boxes\u2026medium.com", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Food", "Recipe", "Chocolate", "Baking", "Health"]}, {"title": "The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to Smart Contracts in Ethereum", "post_link": "https://medium.com/zeppelin-blog/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-smart-contracts-in-ethereum-848f08001f05?source=search_post", "author_name": "Manuel Araoz", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@maraoz", "publish_date": "2016-07-29", "last_modified_date": "2019-02-13", "readtime": "12.3", "claps": 6127, "voters": 1122, "content": "The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to Smart Contracts in EthereumManuel AraozFollowJul 29, 2016 \u00b7 13 min readUpdated Oct 6th 2017, for Truffle v3.4.11 and Solidity v0.4.15.I\u2019ve been working with smart contracts for 4 years, mainly in the Bitcoin blockchain. Some projects I participated in are Proof of Existence, bitcore, and Streamium. In the past months, I\u2019ve been exploring and working with the Ethereum platform.I\u2019ve decided to compile a short guide to ease the way of future programmers learning Ethereum smart contract development. I\u2019ve divided the guide in two sections: how to get started building smart contracts in Ethereum, and a quick note on smart contract security.Getting started with Smart Contracts on Ethereum0. Basic ConceptsThis guide assumes you have a basic level of technical understanding on how cryptocurrencies and blockchains work. If you don\u2019t, I recommend skimming over Andreas Antonopoulos\u2019 Mastering Bitcoin book, Consensys\u2019 \u201cJust Enough Bitcoin for Ethereum\u201d guide, or at least watching this short video by Scott Driscoll. To continue ahead you should know what a public and private key are, why a blockchain needs miners, how decentralized consensus is reached, what a transaction is, and the concepts of transaction scripting and smart contracts.Two other important and related concepts you\u2019ll need to understand before working with Ethereum are the Ethereum Virtual Machine and gas.Ethereum was designed as a smart contract platform. Its origin is actually linked to a critique made by Vitalik Buterin on bitcoin as a very limited smart contract platform. The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is where smart contracts run in Ethereum. It provides a more expressive and complete language than bitcoin for scripting. In fact, it is a Turing Complete programming language. A good metaphor is that the EVM is a distributed global computer where all smart contracts are executed.Given that smart contracts run in the EVM, there must be a mechanism to limit the resources used by each contract. Every single operation that is executed inside the EVM is actually simultaneously executed by every node in the network. This is why gas exists. An Ethereum transaction contract code can trigger data reads and writes, do expensive computations like using cryptographic primitives, make calls (send messages) to other contracts, etc. Each of these operations have a cost measured in gas, and each gas unit consumed by a transaction must be paid for in Ether, based on a gas/Ether price which changes dynamically. This price is deducted from the Ethereum account sending the transaction. Transactions also have a gas limit parameter that is an upper bound on how much gas the transaction can consume, and is used as a safe-guard against programming errors that could deplete an account\u2019s funds. You can read more about gas here.1. Setting up your environmentSo, you know the basics, let\u2019s set everything up to code! To start developing Ethereum apps (or DApps, for decentralized applications, as many people like to call them), you\u2019ll need a client to connect to the network. It will act as your window to the distributed network, and provide a view of the blockchain, where all the EVM state is represented.There are various compatible clients for the protocol, the most popular being geth, a Go language implementation. However, it\u2019s not the most developer-friendly. The best option I\u2019ve found is the testrpc node (yes, the name sucks). Trust me, it will save you a lot of time. Install it and run it (you may need to prepend sudo depending on your setup):$ npm install -g ethereumjs-testrpc$ testrpcYou should run testrpc in a new terminal and leave it running while you develop. Each time you run testrpc, it will generate 10 new addresses with simulated test funds for you to use. This is not real money and you\u2019re safe to try anything with no risk of losing funds.The most popular language for writing smart contracts in Ethereum is Solidity, so we\u2019ll be using that. We\u2019re also using the Truffle development framework, which helps with smart contract creation, compiling, deployment and testing. Let\u2019s start (again, you may need to prepend sudo depending on your setup):# First, let's install truffle$ npm install -g truffle# let's setup our project$ mkdir solidity-experiments$ cd solidity-experiments/$ truffle init Truffle will create all the files for an example project, including contracts for MetaCoin, a sample token contract. You should be able to compile the example contracts by running truffle compile. Then, to deploy the contracts to the simulated network using the testrpc node we have running, you need to run truffle migrate:$ truffle compileCompiling ConvertLib.sol...Compiling MetaCoin.sol...Compiling Migrations.sol...Writing artifacts to ./build/contracts$ truffle migrateUsing network 'development'.Running migration: 1_initial_migration.js  Deploying Migrations...  ... 0x686ed32f73afdf4a84298642c60e2002a6d0d736a5478cc8cb22a655ac018a67  Migrations: 0xa7edbac1156f98907a24d18df8104b5b1bd7027cSaving successful migration to network...  ... 0xe3bf1e50d2262d9ffb015091e5f2974c8ebe0d6fd0df97a7dbcde8a0e51c694aSaving artifacts...Running migration: 2_deploy_contracts.js  Deploying ConvertLib...  ... 0x2e0e6718f01d0da6da2ada13d6e4ad662c5a20e784e04c404e9d4ef1d392bdae  ConvertLib: 0xf4388ce4d4ce8a443228d65ecfa5149205db049f  Linking ConvertLib to MetaCoin  Deploying MetaCoin...  ... 0xb03a3cde0672a2bd4dda6c01dd31641d95bd680c4e21162b3370ed6db7a5620d  MetaCoin: 0x4fc68713f7ac86bb84ac1ef1a09881a9b8d4100fSaving successful migration to network...  ... 0xb9a2245c27ff1c6506c0bc6349caf86a31bc9f700388defe04566b6d237b54b6Saving artifacts...Note to Mac OS X users: Truffle is sometimes confused by .DS_Store files. If you get an error mentioning one of those files, just delete it.We just deployed the sample contracts to our testrpc node. Wohoo! That was easy, right? Time to create our own contract now!2. Writing your first Ethereum smart contractIn this guide we\u2019ll be writing a simple Proof of Existence smart contract. The idea is to create a digital notary that stores hashes of documents as proofs of their existence. Use truffle create contract to get started:$ truffle create contract ProofOfExistence1Now open contracts/ProofOfExistence1.sol in your favorite text editor (I use vim with Solidity syntax highlighting), and paste this initial version of the code:pragma solidity ^0.4.15;// Proof of Existence contract, version 1contract ProofOfExistence1 {  // state  bytes32 public proof;  // calculate and store the proof for a document  // *transactional function*  function notarize(string document) {    proof = proofFor(document);  }  // helper function to get a document's sha256  // *read-only function*  function proofFor(string document) constant returns (bytes32) {    return sha256(document);  }}We\u2019ll start with something simple but incorrect and move towards a better solution. This is a definition of a Solidity contract, which is like a class in other programming languages. Contracts have state and functions. It is important to distinguish two kinds of functions that can appear in a contract:Read-only (constant) functions: functions that don\u2019t perform any state changes. They only read state, perform computations, and return values. As these functions can be resolved locally by each node, they cost no gas. Marked with the keyword constant.Transactional functions: functions that perform a state change in the contract or move funds. As these changes need to be reflected in the blockchain, transactional function execution requires sending a transaction to the network and spending gas.Our contract above has one of each kind, marked in the documentation. We\u2019ll see how the kind of function we\u2019re using with modifies how we interact with the smart contract in the next section.This simple version only stores one proof at a time, using the data type bytes32, or 32 bytes, which is the size of a sha256 hash. The transactional function notarize allows one to store the hash of a document in our smart contract\u2019s state variable proof. Said variable is public, and is the only way a user of our contract has to verify if a document has been notarized. We\u2019ll do that ourselves shortly, but first\u2026Let\u2019s deploy ProofOfExistence1 to the network! This time, you\u2019ll have to edit the migration file (migrations/2_deploy_contracts.js) to make Truffle deploy our new contract. Replace the contents with the following:var ProofOfExistence1 = artifacts.require(\"./ProofOfExistence1.sol\");module.exports = function(deployer) {  deployer.deploy(ProofOfExistence1);};To run this migration again, you\u2019ll need to use the reset flag, to make sure it runs again.truffle migrate --resetMore on how Truffle migrations work can be found here.3. Interacting with your smart contractNow that our contract is deployed, let\u2019s play with it! We can send messages to it via function calls and read its public state. We\u2019ll use the Truffle console for that:$ truffle console// get the deployed version of our contracttruffle(default)> var poe = ProofOfExistence1.at(ProofOfExistence1.address)// and print its address truffle(default)> poe.address0x3d3bce79cccc331e9e095e8985def13651a86004// let's register our first \"document\"truffle(default)> poe.notarize('An amazing idea'){ tx: '0x18ac...cb1a',  receipt:    { transactionHash: '0x18ac...cb1a',     ...   },  logs: [] }// let's now get the proof for that documenttruffle(default)> poe.proofFor('An amazing idea')0xa3287ff8d1abde95498962c4e1dd2f50a9f75bd8810bd591a64a387b93580ee7// To check if the contract's state was correctly changed:truffle(default)> poe.proof()0xa3287ff8d1abde95498962c4e1dd2f50a9f75bd8810bd591a64a387b93580ee7// The hash matches the one we previously calculatedFirst thing we do is obtain a representation of our deployed contract and store it in a variable called poe.We then call the transactional function notarize, which involves a state change. When we call a transactional function, we get a Promise that resolves to a transaction object, not what the actual function returns. Remember that to change the EVM state we need to spend gas and send a transaction to the network. That\u2019s why we get a transaction information object as the result of the Promise, referring to the transaction that did this state change. In this case, we are not interested in the transaction id, so we just discard the Promise. When writing a real app, we\u2019ll want to save it to check the resulting transaction and catch errors.Next, we call the read-only (constant) function proofFor. Remember to mark your read-only functions with the keyword constant, or else Truffle will try to craft a transaction to execute them. This is a way to tell Truffle that we\u2019re not interacting with the blockchain but just reading from it. By using this read-only function, we obtain the sha256 hash of the \u2018An amazing idea\u2019 \u201cdocument\u201d.We now need to contrast this with the state of our smart contract. To check if the state changed correctly, we need to read the proof public state variable. To get the value of a public state variable, we can call a function of the same name, which returns a Promise of its value. In our case, the output hash is the same, so everything worked as expected :)For more info on how to interact with contracts, read this section of the Truffle documentation.As you can see from the snippet above, our first version of the Proof of Existence smart contract seems to be working! Good work! It\u2019s only good for registering one document at a time, though. Let\u2019s create a better version.4. Iterating the contract codeLet\u2019s change the contract to support multiple document proofs. Copy the original file with the name contracts/ProofOfExistence2.sol and apply these changes. The main changes are: we change the proof variable into a bytes32 array and call it proofs, we make it private, and we add a function to check if a document has already been notarized by iterating that array.pragma solidity ^0.4.15;// Proof of Existence contract, version 2contract ProofOfExistence2 {  // state  bytes32[] private proofs;  // store a proof of existence in the contract state  // *transactional function*  function storeProof(bytes32 proof) {    proofs.push(proof);  }// calculate and store the proof for a document  // *transactional function*  function notarize(string document) {    bytes32 proof = proofFor(document);    storeProof(proof);  }// helper function to get a document's sha256  // *read-only function*  function proofFor(string document) constant returns (bytes32) {    return sha256(document);  }// check if a document has been notarized  // *read-only function*  function checkDocument(string document) constant returns (bool) {    bytes32 proof = proofFor(document);    return hasProof(proof);  }  // returns true if proof is stored  // *read-only function*  function hasProof(bytes32 proof) constant returns (bool) {    for (uint256 i = 0; i < proofs.length; i++) {      if (proofs[i] == proof) {        return true;      }    }    return false;  }}Let\u2019s interact with the new functions: (remember to update migrations/2_deploy_contracts.js to include the new contract and run truffle migrate --reset)// deploy contractstruffle(default)>  migrate --reset// Get the new version of the contracttruffle(default)> var poe = ProofOfExistence2.at(ProofOfExistence2.address)// let's check for some new document, and it shouldn't be there.truffle(default)> poe.checkDocument('hello')false// let's now add that document to the proof storetruffle(default)> poe.notarize('hello'){ tx: '0x1d2d...413f',  receipt: { ... },  logs: []}// let's now check again if the document has been notarized!truffle(default)> poe.checkDocument('hello')true// success!// we can also store other documents and they are recorded tootruffle(default)> poe.notarize('some other document');truffle(default)> poe.checkDocument('some other document')trueThis version is better than the first, but still has some problems. Note that every time we want to check if a document was notarized, we need to iterate through all existing proofs. This makes the contract spend more and more gas on each check as more documents are added. A better structure to store proofs is a map. Luckily, Solidity supports maps, and calls them mappings. Another thing we\u2019ll improve in this version is removing all that extra comments marking read-only or transactional functions. I think you get it by now :)Here\u2019s the final version, which should be pretty easy to understand because you followed along previous versions:pragma solidity ^0.4.15;// Proof of Existence contract, version 3contract ProofOfExistence3 {  mapping (bytes32 => bool) private proofs;  // store a proof of existence in the contract state  function storeProof(bytes32 proof) {    proofs[proof] = true;  }  // calculate and store the proof for a document  function notarize(string document) {    var proof = proofFor(document);    storeProof(proof);  }  // helper function to get a document's sha256  function proofFor(string document) constant returns (bytes32) {    return sha256(document);  }  // check if a document has been notarized  function checkDocument(string document) constant returns (bool) {    var proof = proofFor(document);    return hasProof(proof);  }  // returns true if proof is stored  function hasProof(bytes32 proof) constant returns(bool) {    return proofs[proof];  }}That looks good enough. And it works exactly as the 2nd version. To try it out, remember to update the migration file and run truffle migrate --reset again. All the code in this tutorial can be found in this GitHub repo.5. Deploying to the real testnet networkOnce you\u2019ve tested your contract extensively using testrpc in the simulated network, you\u2019re ready to try it in the real network! To do that, we need a real testnet/livenet Ethereum client. Follow these instructions to install geth.During development, you should run nodes in testnet mode, so that you can test everything out without risking real money. Testnet mode (also known as Morden in Ethereum) is basically identical to the real Ethereum, but the Ether token there has no monetary value. Don\u2019t be lazy and remember to always develop in testnet mode, you will regret it if you lose real Ether due to a programming error (trust me on that, hehe).Run geth in testnet mode, with RPC server enabled:geth --testnet --rpc console 2>> geth.logThis will open a console where you can type in basic commands to control your node/client. Your node will begin downloading the testnet blockchain, and you can check progress by checking eth.blockNumber. While the blockchain is downloading, you can still run commands. For example, let\u2019s create an account: (remember the password!)> personal.newAccount()Passphrase:Repeat passphrase:\"0xa88614166227d83c93f4c50be37150b9500d51fc\"Let\u2019s send some coins there and check the balance. You can get free testnet Ether here. Just copy-paste the address you just generated and this faucet will send you some testnet Ether. To check you balance, run:> eth.getBalance(eth.accounts[0])0It will show no balance because your node hasn\u2019t synced with the rest of the network yet. While you wait for that, check your balance in a testnet block explorer. There, you can also see the current testnet highest block number (#1819865 at the time of writing), which you can use in combination with eth.blockNumber to know when your node has synced completely.Once your node has synced, you\u2019re ready to deploy the contracts to the testnet using Truffle. First, unlock your main geth account, so that Truffle can use it. And be sure that it holds some balance, or you won\u2019t be able to push a new contract to the network. On geth run:> personal.unlockAccount(eth.accounts[0], \"mypassword\", 24*3600)true> eth.getBalance(eth.accounts[0])1000000000000000000Ready to go! If some of these two are not working for you, check the steps above and make sure you\u2019ve completed them correctly. Now run:$ truffle migrate --resetNote that this time, it will take longer to complete, as we\u2019re connecting to the actual network and not one simulated by testrpc. Once it completes, you can interact with the contract using the same approach as before.The testnet-deployed version of ProofOfExistence3 can be found at the address 0xcaf216d1975f75ab3fed520e1e3325dac3e79e05. (Feel free to interact with it and send your proofs!)I\u2019ll leave the details on how to deploy to the live network to the reader. You should only do this once you\u2019ve extensively tested your contracts in simulated and test networks. Remember any programming error can result in monetary loss in the livenet!Smart Contract security in Ethereum is hard\u201cSmart contracts are pretty difficult to get right.\u201d Emin G\u00fcn SirerGiven that by nature, smart contracts are computer code that define how money moves, I couldn\u2019t end this guide without even a small note on security. I\u2019ll be talking about smart contract security in much more depth at future posts (edit: like this one), but here are some quick notes to get you started.Some problems you should be aware of (and avoid):Reentrancy: Do not perform external calls in contracts. If you do, ensure that they are the very last thing you do.Send can fail: When sending money, your code should always be prepared for the send function to fail.Loops can trigger gas limit: Be careful when looping over state variables, which can grow in size and make gas consumption hit the limits.Call stack depth limit: Don\u2019t use recursion, and be aware that any call can fail if stack depth limit is reached. EDIT: this is no longer a problem.Timestamp dependency: Do not use timestamps in critical parts of the code, because miners can manipulate them.These are provided just as examples of unexpected behaviors that can lead for theft or destruction of funds in your smart contract. The moral is: if you\u2019re writing smart contracts, you\u2019re writing code that handles real money. You should be very careful! Write tests, do code reviews, and audit your code.The best way to avoid obvious security problems is to have a solid understanding of the language. I recommend you read the Solidity documentation if you have the time. We still need better tools for acceptable smart contract security.

But this is just the beginning. As blockchain systems continue to evolve and scale, one great way to dip into this new space and leverage this technology is with decentralized applications, otherwise known as dApps.CryptoKitties, famous for its congestion of the Ethereum Blockchain, is a great example of a dApp, uniquely combining concepts of breedable and collectible cats with the blockchain. This sensational game is just one creative example out of a virtually unlimited number of opportunities.Although seemingly very complicated, certain frameworks and tools have been developed to abstract your interactions with the blockchain and smart contracts. In this blog post, I will go over one way to create a decentralized voting app on Ethereum. I will briefly go over Ethereum, but you probably should have an understanding of it to use this guide to the fullest. In addition, I do expect you to know Javascript.Why make a Decentralized Voting app?Essentially, a great decentralized application utilizing blockchain technology allows you perform the same actions you would today (like transferring money) without a trusted third party. The best dApps have a specific real world use-case that leverages the unique characteristics of blockchain.In essence, the blockchain is a shared, programmable, cryptographically secure and therefore trusted ledger which no single user controls and which can be inspected by anyone.- Klaus SchwabEven though a voting app might not be a great app for consumers, I\u2019ve chosen to use it for this guide because the main issues blockchain solves \u2014 transparency, security, accessibility, audibility \u2014 are the main problems plaguing current democratic elections.Since a blockchain is a permanent record of transactions (votes) that are distributed, every vote can irrefutably be traced back to exactly when and where it happened without revealing the voter\u2019s identity. In addition, past votes cannot be changed, while the present can\u2019t be hacked, because every transaction is verified by every single node in the network. And any outside or inside attacker must have control of 51% of the nodes to alter the record.Even if the attacker was able to achieve that while incorrectly entering user votes with their real IDs under the radar, end to end voting systems could allow voters to verify whether their vote was correctly entered in the system, making the system extremely safe.Core Components of EthereumI do expect you to have an understanding of Blockchain and Ethereum for the remainder of this guide. Here is an awesome guide about it, and I\u2019ve written a brief overview of the core components I\u2019d like you to know.Smart Contracts act as the back-end logic and storage. A contract is written in Solidity, a smart contract language, and is a collection of code and data that resides at a specific address on the Ethereum blockchain. It\u2019s very similar to a class in Object Oriented Programming, where it includes functions and state variables. Smart Contracts, along with the Blockchain, are the basis of all Decentralized Applications. They are, like Blockchain, immutable and distributed, which means upgrading them will be a pain if they are already on the Ethereum Network. Fortunately, here are some ways to do that.The Ethereum Virtual Machine(EVM) handles the internal state and computation of the entire Ethereum Network. Think of the EVM as this massive decentralized computer that contains \u201caddresses\u201d that are capable of executing code, changing data, and interacting with each other.Web3.js is a Javascript API that allows you to interact with the Blockchain, including making transactions and calls to smart contracts. This API abstracts the communication with Ethereum Clients, allowing developers to focus on the content of their application. You must have a web3 instance imbedded in your browser to do so.Other Tools we will useTruffle is a popular testing development framework for Ethereum. It includes a development blockchain, compilation and migration scripts to deploy your contract to the Blockchain, contract testing, and so on. It makes development easier!Truffle Contracts is an abstraction on top of the Web3 Javascript API, allowing you to easily connect and interact with your Smart Contract.Metamask brings Ethereum to your browser. It is a browser extension that provides a secure web3 instance linked to your Ethereum address, allowing you to use Decentralized Applications. We will not be using Metamask in this tutorial, but it is a way for people to interact with your DApp in production. Instead, we will inject our own web3 instance during development. For more information, check out this link.Let\u2019s Start!For simplicity, we actually won\u2019t be building the full voting system I described earlier. For ease of explanation, it will just be a one page application where a user can enter their ID and vote for a candidate. There will also be a button that counts and displays the number of votes per candidate.This way, we will be able to focus the process of creating and interacting with the smart contracts within an application. The source code for this entire application will be in this repository, and you will need to have Node.js and npm installed.First, let\u2019s install Truffle globally.npm install -g truffleTo use Truffle commands, you must run them in an existing project.git clone https://github.com/tko22/truffle-webpack-boilerplatecd truffle-webpack-boilerplatenpm installThis repository is just a skeleton of a Truffle Box, which are boilerplates or example applications that you can get in one command \u2014 truffle unbox [box name]. However, the Truffle box with webpack isn\u2019t updated with the latest versions and includes an example application. Thus, I created this repo (the one linked in the instructions above).2. Directory StructureYour directory structure should include these:contracts/ \u2014 Folder holding all of the Contracts. DO NOT DELETE Migrations.solmigrations/ \u2014 Folder holding Migration files, which help you deploy your smart contracts into the Blockchain.src/ \u2014 holds the HTML/CSS and Javascript files for the applicationtruffle.js \u2014 Truffle Configuration filebuild/ \u2014 You won\u2019t see this folder until you compile your contracts. This folder holds the build artifacts so don\u2019t modify any of these files! Build artifacts describe the function and architecture of your contract and give Truffle Contracts and web3 information on how to interact with your Smart Contract in the Blockchain.1. Write your Smart ContractsEnough with the setup and introduction. Let\u2019s get into the code! First off, we\u2019ll be writing our Smart Contract, which is written in Solidity (the other languages aren\u2019t as popular). It may seem scary, but it\u2019s not.For any application, you want your smart contracts to be as simple as possible, even stupidly simple. Remember that you have to pay for every computation/transaction you make, and your smart contracts will be on the Blockchain forever. So, you really want it to work perfectly\u2013\u2013meaning, the more complex it is, the easier it is to make a mistake.Our contract will include:State Variables \u2014 variables that hold values that are permanently stored on the Blockchain. We will use state variables to hold a list and number of Voters and Candidates.Functions \u2014 Functions are the executables of smart contracts. They are what we will call to interact with the Blockchain, and they have different levels of visibility, internally and externally. Keep in mind that whenever you want to change the value/state of a variable, a transaction must occur \u2014 costing Ether. You can also make calls to the Blockchain, which won\u2019t cost any Ether because the changes you made will be destroyed (more on this in Section 3 when we actually make the transactions and calls).Events \u2014 Whenever an event is called, the value passed into the event will be logged in the transaction\u2019s log. This allows Javascript callback functions or resolved promises to view the certain value you wanted to pass back after a transaction. This is because every time you make a transaction, a transaction log will be returned. We will use an event to log the ID of the newly created Candidate, which we\u2019ll display (check the first bullet point of Section 3).Struct Types \u2014 This is very similar to a C struct. Structs allow you to hold multiple variables, and are awesome for things with multiple attributes. Candidates will only have their name and party, but you can definitely add more attributes to them.Mappings \u2014 Think of these like hash-maps or dictionaries, where it has a key-value pair. We will use two mappings.There are a couple more types that aren\u2019t listed here, but some of them are a little more complicated. These five encompass many of the structures a smart contract will generally use. These types are explained more in depth here.For reference, here\u2019s the Smart Contract\u2019s code. Note that this file should be called Voting.sol but I wanted the Github gist to have styling so I gave it a .js extension. Like the rest of this guide, I will provide comments within the code that will explain what it is doing, and I\u2019ll explain the big picture afterwards while pointing out certain caveats and logic.Basically, we have two Structs (types that hold multiple variables) that describe a Voter and a Candidate. With Structs, we are able to assign multiple properties to them, such as emails, address, and so on.To keep track of Voters and Candidates, we put them into separate mappings where they are integer indexed. A Candidate or Voter\u2019s index/key\u2013\u2013lets call it ID \u2014 is the sole way for functions to access them.We also keep track of the number of Voters and Candidates, which will help us index them. In addition, don\u2019t forget about the event in line 8, which will log the candidate\u2019s ID when it\u2019s added. This event will be used by our interface, since we need to keep track of a candidate\u2019s ID in order to vote for a candidate.I know, contrary to what I said earlier about making contracts super simple, I made this contract a little more complicated in comparison to what this application actually does. However, I did this so that it would be a lot easier for you guys to make edits and add features to this application afterward (more on that at the end). If you\u2019d like to make an even simpler voting application, the smart contract could work in less than 15 lines of code.Note that the state variables numCandidates and numVoters are not declared public. By default, these variables have a visibility of internal, which means that they can only be directly accessed by the current contract or derived contracts (don\u2019t worry about that, we won\u2019t be using it).We are using 32bytes for strings instead of using the string type. Our EVM has a word-size of 32 bytes, so it is \u201coptimized\u201d for dealing with data in chunks of 32 bytes. (Compilers, such as Solidity, have to do more work and generate more bytecode when data isn\u2019t in chunks of 32 bytes, which effectively leads to higher gas cost.)When a user votes, a new Voter struct is created and added to the mapping. In order to count the number of votes a certain candidate has, you must loop through all the Voters and count the number of votes. Candidates operate on the same behavior. Thus, these mappings will hold the history of all Candidates and Voters.2. Instantiate web3 and contractsWith our Smart Contract completed, we now need to run our test blockchain and deploy this contract onto the Blockchain. We\u2019ll also need a way to talk to it, which will be via web3.js.Before we start our test blockchain, we must create a file called 2_deploy_contracts.js inside the folder /contracts that tells it to include your Voting Smart Contract when you migrate.To start the development Ethereum blockchain, go to your command line and run:truffle developThis will live on your command line. Since Solidity is a compiled language, we must compile it to bytecode first for the EVM to execute.compileYou should see a build/ folder inside your directory now. This folder holds the build artifacts, which are critical to the inner workings of Truffle, so don\u2019t touch them!Next, we must migrate the contract. Migrations is a Truffle script that helps you alter the state of your application\u2019s contract as you develop. Remember that your contract is deployed to a certain address on the Blockchain, so whenever you make changes, your contract will be located at a different address. Migrations help you do this and also help you move data around.migrateCongratulations! Your smart contract is now on the Blockchain forever. Well, not really\u2026. because truffle develop refreshes every time you stop it.If you\u2019d like to have a persisting blockchain, consider Ganache, which is also developed by Truffle. If you are using Ganache, you will not need to call truffle develop. Instead, you will run truffle compile and truffle migrate. To understand what it really takes to deploy a contract without Truffle, check out this blog post.Once we have deployed the smart contract to the Blockchain, we will have to setup a web3.0 instance with Javascript on the browser whenever the application starts. Thus, the next piece of code will be placed in the bottom of js/app.js. Note that we are using web3.0 version 0.20.1.You don\u2019t really have to worry too much if you don\u2019t understand this code. Just know that this will be run when the application starts and will check if there already is a web3 instance (Metamask) in your browser. If there isn\u2019t, we\u2019ll just create one that talks to localhost:9545, which is the Truffle development blockchain.If you\u2019re using Ganache, you must change the port to 7545. Once an instance is created, we will call the start function (I\u2019ll define it in the next section).3. Add functionalityThe last thing we\u2019ll need to do is to write the interface for the application. This involves the essentials for any web application\u2013\u2013HTML, CSS, and Javascript (We\u2019ve already written a little of the Javascript with creating a web3 instance). First, let\u2019s create our HTML file.This is a very simple page, with an input form for user ID, and buttons for Voting and Counting votes. When those buttons are clicked, they will call specific functions that vote, and will find the number of votes for the candidates.There are three important div elements though, with ids: candidate-box, msg, and vote-box, which will hold checkboxes for each candidate, a message, and the number of votes, respectively. We also import JQuery, Bootstrap, and app.js.Now, we just need to interact with the Contract and implement the functions for voting and counting the number of votes for each candidate. JQuery will manipulate the DOM, and we\u2019ll be using Promises as we make transactions or calls to the Blockchain. Below is the code for app.js.Note that the code I provided in the previous step for creating a web3 instance is also here. First, we import the necessary libraries and webpack stuff, including web3 and Truffle Contracts. We will be using Truffle Contracts, which is built on top of web3 to interact with the Blockchain.To use it, we\u2019ll grab the build artifacts that were automatically built when we compiled the voting smart contract and use them to create the Truffle Contract. Finally, we set up the functions in the global variable window for starting the app, voting for a candidate, and finding the number of votes.To actually interact with the Blockchain, we must create an instance of the Truffle Contract by using the deployed function. This, in turn, will return a promise with the instance as the return value that you will use to call functions from the smart contract.There are two ways to interact with those functions: transactions and calls. A transaction is a write-operation, and it will be broadcast to the entire network and processed by miners (and thus, costs Ether). You must perform a transaction if you\u2019re changing a state variable, since it will change the state of the blockchain.A call is a read-operation, simulating a transaction but discarding the change in state. Thus, it will not cost Ether. This is great for calling getter functions (check out the four getter functions we wrote previously in our smart contract).To make a transaction with Truffle Contracts, you write instance.functionName(param1, param2), with instance as the instance that was returned by the deployed function (Check line 36 for an example). This transaction will return a promise with the transaction data as the return value. Thus, if you return a value in your smart contract function but you perform a transaction with that same function, it will not return that value.This is why we have an event that will log whatever you want it to write into the transaction data that will be returned. In the case of lines 36\u201337, we make a transaction to add a Candidate. When we resolve the promise, we have the transaction data in result.To get the candidateID that we logged with the event AddedCandidate() (check the smart contract to see it 0), we must go through the logs and retrieve it like this: result.logs[0].args.candidateID.To really see what\u2019s going on, use the Chrome developer tools to print out the result and look through its structure of result.To make a call, you will write instance.functionName.call(param1,param2). However, if a function has the keyword view, then Truffle Contracts will automatically create a call and thus you don\u2019t need to add the .call.This is why our getter functions have the view keyword. Unlike making a transaction, the returned promise of a call will have a return value of whatever is returned by the smart contract function.I will now explain the 3 functions briefly but this should be very familiar if you\u2019ve built applications retrieving/changing data from a data store and manipulating the DOM accordingly. Think of the Blockchain as your database, and the Truffle Contracts as the API to get data from your database.App.start()This function is called immediately after we create a web3 instance. To get Truffle Contracts to work, we must set the provider to the created web3 instance and set defaults (like which account you\u2019re using and the amount of gas you want to pay to make a transaction).Since we are in development mode, we can use any amount of gas and any account. During production, we would take the account provided by MetaMask and try to figure out the smallest amount of gas you could use, since it\u2019s actually real money.With everything set up, we will now display the checkboxes for each candidate for the user to vote. To do this, we must create an instance of the contract and get the Candidate\u2019s information. If there aren\u2019t any candidates, we will create them. In order for a user to vote for a candidate, we must provide the ID of that certain candidate. Thus, we make each checkbox element have an id(HTML element attribute) of the ID of the candidate. Additionally, we will add the number Of candidates to a global variable numOfCandidates, which we will use in App.findNumOfVotes(). JQuery is used to append each checkbox and its candidate name to .candidate-box.App.vote()This function will vote for a certain candidate based on which checkbox is clicked and its id attribute.One, we will check whether the user has input their userID, which is their identification. If they didn\u2019t, we display a message telling them to do so.Two, we will check whether the user is voting for a candidate, checking if there is at least one checkbox that\u2019s clicked. If none of the checkboxes were clicked, we will also display a message telling them to vote for a candidate. If one of the checkboxes is clicked, we will grab the id attribute of that checkbox, which is also the linked candidate\u2019s ID, and use that to vote for the candidate.Once the transaction has been completed, we will resolve the returned promise and display a \u201cVoted\u201d message.App.findNumOfVotes()This last function will find the number of Votes for each candidate and display them. We will go through the candidates and call two smart contract functions, getCandidate and totalVotes. We will resolve those promises and create an HTML element for that certain candidate.Now, start the application and you\u2019ll see it on http://localhost:8080/!npm run devResourcesI know, it\u2019s a lot\u2026 You might have this article open for a while as you slowly develop this application and really understand what\u2019s going on. But that\u2019s learning! Please supplement this guide with all the documentation from Ethereum, Truffle, and what I have provided below. I\u2019ve tried to hit many of the key points in this article, but it\u2019s just a brief overview and these resources will help a lot.Everything about Solidity and Smart Contracts \u2014 I mean EverythingEverything about TruffleTruffle Contracts DocsWeb3 Javascript API \u2014 this will be great to know and reference, but Truffle Contracts abstracts many parts of thisUseful DApp patternsEthereum Docs \u2014 look to the side bar and there\u2019s plenty of stuffCryptoKitties Code Explanation \u2014 The writer goes through the important parts of CryptoKitties\u2019 Smart ContractSmart Contract Best Practices \u2014 a must readConclusionBuilding applications on Ethereum is pretty similar to a regular application calling a backend service. The hardest part is writing a robust and complete smart contract. I hope this guide helped you understand the core knowledge of decentralized applications and Ethereum and will help you kick-start your interest in developing them.If you\u2019d like to build off of what we\u2019ve built, here are some ideas. I\u2019ve actually written the smart contract in such a way that it\u2019s easily implemented with everything I\u2019ve given you in this guide.Display the party of each Candidate. We already get the party of a candidate when we run getCandidate(id).Check if the User-entered ID is unique.Ask and store more information about a User, such as their date of birth and home address.Add in an option to see whether a person with a specific id has voted or not. You would create a new form to enter in an ID, which you would then search for that certain user in the blockchain.Write a new smart contract function that counts the votes for BOTH candidates at once. Currently, we have to make two separate calls for two candidates, requiring the contract to loop through all the Users twice.Allow new Candidates to be added. This means adding a new form to add Candidates, but also changing up a little on how we display and vote for candidates in the frontend.Require Users to have an Ethereum Address to vote. My logic for not including user addresses is because voters wouldn\u2019t be expected to have Ethereum to participate in this voting process. However, many DApps will require users to have an Ethereum Address.Also, here are some tips that could prevent some roadblocks from happening:Double and triple check your smart contract functions when something weird is happening. I spent a couple hours on a bug to figure out that I returned the wrong value in one of my functions.Check whether your URL and port are correct when you connect to your development blockchain. Remember: 7545 is for truffle develop and 9545 is for Ganache. These are defaults, so if you can\u2019t connect to your blockchain, you might\u2019ve changed them.I didn\u2019t go over this because this guide would\u2019ve been too long and I probably will make another post on this \u2014 but you should test your contracts! It will help a lot.If you aren\u2019t familiar with promises, go through how they work and how to use them. Truffle Contracts uses promises and the beta for web3 will also support promises. They can, if you do them wrong, mess up a lot of the data you\u2019re retrieving.Cheers to working towards a decentralized and secure internet \u2014 Web 3.0!I hope you enjoyed reading this guide as much as I enjoyed writing it!

It\u2019s a Truffle Box and you can get it here.Update: I\u2019ve since rewritten the Truffle Box to use a Render-Prop pattern instead of the HOC pattern described below. Nevertheless, it should be straight-forward to use and understand.The first time I touched Ethereum was back in 2013, when Alethzero was the hottest thing ever. My friends all thought Ethereum was super fringe at the time, and unfortunately I stopped paying attention to it.Fast-forward to 2017.Ethereum, smart contracts, and dapps are all the rage. Suddenly everyone is saying that this is sure to be the world of tomorrow. Well okay I thought, it\u2019s been 3 years, making dapps should be super simple now, right?Yes and no.We no longer have to use geth on the command line for everything and write Solidity without syntax highlighting. We also have Truffle to help us write our contracts and test them to make sure we can integrate them with our frontends. But when it comes to tying this all together, things are not so straight-forward.Warning: The following is not a tutorial. This is simply an introduction to the skeleton project that I am sharing as a Truffle Box.Truffle BoxesTruffle boxes are basically skeleton Truffle projects packaged with a frontend. You can take a look at some of them here.There is a Truffle Box with a Create-React-App built-in. But upon closer inspection it just isn\u2019t built for rapid development. The app itself is ejected and the frontend is mixed in with all the files from the Truffle project. Maybe I\u2019m not the brightest lightbulb, but it was a little confusing for me.Next.jsZeit\u2019s amazing React.js framework, Next.js is one of the best things to have hit the Javascript community since\u2026 dare I say Mootools?It\u2019s as simple as Create-React-App, but it doesn\u2019t eject into a huge mess if you need to customize a couple things here and there. In fact, it\u2019s the only way I write React apps nowadays.Combining the twoWell the logical thing at this point is to combine the two. So I did. I wrote a Truffle Box that allows you to run the following:truffle unbox adrianmcli/truffle-nextAnd immediately (and by immediately, I mean immediately after it downloads everything, hah) you will have a Truffle project with a sample smart contract as well as a Next.js app that interfaces with the smart contract.Go to the repo and follow the instructions if you want to do this yourself while following along.The Smart ContractThe smart contract that comes with the skeleton is simple:pragma solidity ^0.4.18;contract SimpleStorage {  uint storedData;  function set(uint x) public {    storedData = x;  }  function get() public view returns (uint) {    return storedData;  }}You can do two things:Set a value.Get a value.That\u2019s it. There\u2019s nothing more I can say about it.The Next.js AppThe Next.js app is a bit more complex and it consists of three pages:index.js \u2014 This is a barebones Next.js page. It links to other pages which are web3-enabled. In your dapp, this can be a landing page.accounts.js \u2014 This is a page listing the accounts returned from Web3. This file demonstrates the basic use of the withWeb3 higher-order component (HOC).dapp.js \u2014 This is a barebones demonstration dapp that utilizes the withWeb3 HOC, but also makes calls to the contract. More specifically, it stores a value and gets a value.And this is what the accounts.js page looks like:The above code demonstrates very simply that wrapping your component with the withWeb3 HOC auto-magically injects some props into your component (in this case, only accounts is being used).For a more detailed example, check out the dapp.js file:There are two buttons and a balance display. The first button sets 5 as the value, and the second button simply retrieves the current value in the deployed contract.On line 10, you can see that contract.set() is called with a value of 5 (while specifying that the command is being called from the first account, i.e. accounts[0]).On line 16, you can see that contract.get.call() is called in a similar fashion. The resulting response is not a native Javascript number, so we call toNumber() on it to cast it back to a Number. From there, we simply set it as our component state and it renders to our app.Note that contract and accounts conveniently come from our this.props thanks to our higher-order component :).ConclusionSo that\u2019s it! I hope this was at least slightly useful for you. I didn\u2019t mean for this to be a tutorial or anything, I just wanted to share my Truffle Box.If you felt this was interesting, please give me a CLAP.

In the first part of this article, we saw that Truffle is used for testing contracts in a simple way. Go to the project that we discussed in part 2, open a few command interfaces and then launch ganache-cli.ganache-cli -p 7545set up a new folder and name it \u201ctest.\u201d Then create a test file named \u201cTestExample.js\u201d in it, then paste the following details in it.var Wrestling = artifacts.require(\u201cWrestling\u201d);contract(\u2018Wrestling\u2019, function(accounts) {// \u201cit\u201d is the block to run a single testit(\u201cshould not be able to withdraw ether\u201d, function() {Wrestling.deployed().then(function (inst) {// We retrieve the instance of the deployed Wrestling contractwrestlingInstance = inst;var account0 = accounts[0];// how much ether the account has before running the following transactionvar beforeWithdraw = web3.eth.getBalance(account0);// We try to use the function withdraw from the Wrestling contract// It should revert because the wrestling isn\u2019t finishedwrestlingInstance.withdraw({from: account0}).then(function (val) {assert(false, \u201cshould revert\u201d);}).catch(function (err) {// We expect a \u201crevert\u201d exception from the VM, because the user// should not be able to withdraw etherconsole.log(\u2018Error: \u2018 + err);// how much ether the account has after running the transactionvar afterWithdraw = web3.eth.getBalance(account0);var diff = beforeWithdraw \u2014 afterWithdraw;// The account paid for gas to execute the transactionconsole.log(\u2018Difference: \u2018 + web3.fromWei(diff, \u201cether\u201d));})})})});The effect of this is that it will get the Wrestling Contract, install it on our test network and then try to utilize the withdraw function. This should return an error since no one should be able to withdraw from a game before it ends.To run the test on the development console, use the following commandtruffle test \u2014 network developmentThe best thing would be for you to try and play a wrestling game and then ensure that it is only the winning party that can be able to withdraw the ether. Here is another technique to use when testing and you can also get more information from Truffle\u2019s documentation. You can also use these security tools that have been developed by the community to test your code.Business LogicApart from testing the internal workings of the contract, test it as a whole to see if it can do what is was created to accomplish.One of the first things you should do is to ensure that the contract is well commented upon. This will result in clear and well-written code. Also, ensure that the Smart Contract is as simple as possible and just write in the part of your contract that needs to be decentralized. In case the Smart Contract is a part of dapp, distinguish between what should be included in the blockchain and what needs to be on the user interface and at the backend of the application.Have a Good Understanding of the PlatformReading the docs will give you a good understanding of what you are doing. You also need to read more about Solidity.For instance, you should know that the fixed-point variable or floats or double have not yet been fully developed. Any division that uses the type \u201cuint\u201d for instance like 7/3 will get rounded to the closest integer. In this case, that is 2. Therefore, there are still many things on this platform that are still being worked on.Since Blockchain is public, anyone who is interested can decipher the value that your variables hold, even if you try to hide the information. It is also possible for someone to figure out how you generate random number strings and generate their own.Contracts that are only valid for certain periods of time are also quite popular. You will need to use a third-party application to make the contract run at certain times considering that Smart Contracts cannot trigger themselves. Also, some bad miners can try and interfere with your smart contract in case it is dependent on time to execute a transaction.You should also be aware that since the Smart Contracts are public, anyone can access it and read it and even interact with it. You should also be aware that in case your contract interacts or in other way connects to other contracts an evil miner can interfere with how your contract gets executed.Just keep in mind that since there\u2019s lots of cash involved, people will do just about anything to interfere with your smart contracts.External PartiesThere are many users who are actively trying to make the use of Ethereum Blockchain as easy as possible, such that you do not have to download it into your device. This has led to the development of MEW, which allows you to move ether and install smart contracts. You can also use INFURA to connect to the Ethereum Blockchain through an API. This creates a solid tool when it is used together with Truffle.Keep in mind that due to the amount of cash that is moved in these platforms, most hackers target them. Therefore, you have to decide whether security or convenience is more important to you. So, make your decision based on how much money you move around on this platform and the number of transactions that you carry out.How to Get StartedThere is so much information that can help you to get started.You can get information on video from @KonstantHackerYou can read more on Solidity docsInformation on Security when it comes to Solidity docsGet more recommendationsWhen it comes to security, do as much research as you can on the subject matter and always ensure that you use good programming practices.You can also participate in programs where people are asked to find bugs since you can get a lot of rewards for this.In case you detect a bug and how to do something in a better way, make sure to share it with the rest of the community, to help everyone gain from your knowledge.Tokens and ERCsTokens on Ethereum are smart contracts.If you have come across terms such as ERC20, ERC721 among others, just know that these are basic functions that are being used by the community. You can even set up your functions and come up with scripts that can manage coins. The code used is for providing guidelines and is not the actual rules that are used.While you do not have to follow the rules strictly, there are several advantages to doing so. First, it will make it easier for everyone to understand what you have developed and how to interact with it. Therefore, they will be more open to it. For instance, if you use Dapps or Mist, they will know how to interact with it. You will also find the ready-made implementation of the smart contract as it has already been developed by the community using Frameworks such as OpenZeppelin. It has been already tried and tested by many experienced users.In this tutorial, we will set up an incomplete ERC20 token and then turn it into an ERC721 token, to distinguish the difference between these two tokens and help you understand how tokens work.Making a TokenUse the following functions and events to come up with an ERC token.contract ERC20Interface {function totalSupply() public constant returns (uint);function balanceOf(address tokenOwner) public constant returns (uint balance);function allowance(address tokenOwner, address spender) public constant returns (uint remaining);function transfer(address to, uint tokens) public returns (bool success);function approve(address spender, uint tokens) public returns (bool success);function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint tokens) public returns (bool success);event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint tokens);event Approval(address indexed tokenOwner, address indexed spender, uint tokens);}The first thing would be to give the token a namestring public name = \u201cOur Tutorial Coin\u201d;Then assign it a symbolstring public symbol = \u201cOTC\u201d;the give it decimalsuint8 public decimals = 2;You cannot fully use fixed numbers in Solidity since it doesn\u2019t support this. This means that all numbers have to be represented as integers. Now 123456 can turn into 1234.56 if two decimals are used, or they can turn into 12.3456 if four decimals are used. If you use a value of 0, it means that you don\u2019t want your tokens to be visible. Ether has 18 decimals.We shall start by using 0 tokens. This function \u201ctotalSupply()\u201d gets the \u201ctotalSupply\u201d variable.function totalSupply() public constant returns (uint256 _totalSupply) {return totalSupply;}To send tokens to another address, use the \u201ctransfer()\u201d function.function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool) {// avoid sending tokens to the 0x0 addressrequire(_to != address(0));// make sure the sender has enough tokensrequire(_value <= balances[msg.sender]);// we substract the tokens from the sender\u2019s balancebalances[msg.sender] = balances[msg.sender] \u2014 _value;// then add them to the receiverbalances[_to] = balances[_to] + _value;// We trigger an event, note that Transfer has a capital \u201cT,\u201d it\u2019s not the function itself withTransfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);// the transfer was successful, we return a truereturn true;}This is the center of the ERC20 token.To make a token compliant with ERC20, you have to use the following functions \u201capprove(),\u201d \u201ctransferFrom(),\u201d and \u201callowance().\u201d The work of the alliance function is to determine how much one address can send to another address. When one address approves another one, then the approved address can spend money that is in the account of the approving address. This can represent a security issue. For instance, if the approving address allows X tokens to be transferred from it and then decided to reduce the amount to Y tokens, the approved address can quickly transfer X tokens into its account before the allowance is changed to Y tokens.To address the various shortcomings that ERC20 has, ERC223 and ERC777 were developed. The main work of ERC223 is to prevent money from being sent to the wrong address, while the ERC777 will send notifications to the receiving address about any tokens that are sent into it.ERC721This is fundamentally different from the ERC20 token.Each address in ERC20 has a balance of tokens, while in ERC721, each address will have a list of tokens.mapping(address => uint[]) internal listOfOwnerTokens;When using Solidity, you have to manually keep track of tokens since it doesn\u2019t have \u201cindexOf()\u201d method of arrays. To make our work easier, we can use mapping to know who owns which tokens.mapping(uint => address) internal tokenIdToOwner;The \u201ctransfer()\u201d function that is in ERC721 will assign the token to a new owner. To prevent the old owner from transferring the token to another address, you have to add more instructions inside the \u201ctransfer()\u201d method.MintingTo create new ERC20 and ERC721 tokens, use the function \u201cMint().\u201d It is important that you only set a few authorized addresses to be able to mint tokens in your contract. Mint is not present in the standard interface, rather it is an added functionality, in the same way, that you can add other functionalities to the token.MetadataNon-fungible assets symbolize an asset. To describe this asset, you can use such a stringmapping(uint => string) internal referencedMetadata;A smart contract doesn\u2019t contain tangible assets; rather it is a certification. For instance, the same way you can store a license plate number in a contract but not the physical vehicle.To store virtual assets, you can use IPFS has as the metadata. The file that is kept in the IPFS is referred to as IPFS hash. If you store any file on IPFS, it will always be available on the network or at least any computer that is connected to the IPFS network.There is a proposal for an ERC821, whose purpose is to come up with better designs, but the discussion on this issue has not yet been completed, so you can chime into that discussion if you are interested.You can see different ways that ERC20 and ERC721 have been used in the Githushub repository.You can also check out the OpenZepplin framework, as they have good smart contracts that are regularly assessed. Before making use of any contract, always read it first, so that you can make up your mind about which is the best one to use.This is the end of the 3-part series.Bonus Information: ICOs and CrowdSalesInitial Coin Offerings (ICOs) are not exactly about the development of Ethereum, rather, they are a way of raising money from many people.In case a new company wants to raise funds, to run their operations, they come up with new coins, which they then sellout to the public within a limited period throw an ICO or crowdfunding.Before Blockchains ever existed, most new companies used crowdfunding websites to raise the funds they needed. These websites took a percentage of the funds raised as their commission. But with ICOs, these middlemen are taken out of the picture, and the companies raise their funds directly.Considering the number of scams that exist, if you are an investor, you need to be cautious about where you invest your cash. On the other hand, if you are a developer, a crowdsale is a smart contract where tokens are sold in exchange for ether for a limited time frame. There is no standard way of doing this, but you can get an example from OpenZepplin repo, or you can check out this tutorial on Ethereum\u2019s website.", "responses": 1, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Coding", "Programming", "Codelikeagirl", "Blockchain"]}, {"title": "How to build Dapps with the Ethereum Blockchain", "post_link": "https://media.consensys.net/how-to-build-dapps-with-the-ethereum-blockchain-83760f0eb87b?source=search_post", "author_name": "ConsenSys", "author_link": "https://media.consensys.net/@ConsenSys", "publish_date": "2016-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2019-05-22", "readtime": "1.44", "claps": 47, "voters": 47, "content": "How to build Dapps with the Ethereum BlockchainConsenSysFollowDec 7, 2016 \u00b7 2 min readIf you\u2019re interested in building web apps with the Ethereum blockchain, here is a useful introduction to developing with Truffle and Metamask!Dan Finlay, software developer of Metamask, walks us through a simple example how Truffle and Metamask work together with the end-user in mind.For many types of Dapps (Distributed Apps), Truffle does everything you could want: It compiles your blockchain contracts, injects them into your web app, and can even run a test suite against them!With Metamask, all your users need to do is install the Chrome plugin, and they will have their own secure blockchain accounts right there in the convenience of their browsers.If you want to learn more about the process, continue reading Dan Finlay\u2019s article here.", "responses": 1, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Blockchain", "Web Development", "Dapps", "Software Development"]}, {"title": "The Right Way To Develop Your Ethereum Dapp is Here: DRIZZLE!", "post_link": "https://medium.com/hackernoon/the-right-way-to-develop-your-ethereum-dapp-is-here-drizzle-a633af45f031?source=search_post", "author_name": "Niharika Singh", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@Niharika3297", "publish_date": "2018-12-08", "last_modified_date": "2019-05-24", "readtime": "9.04", "claps": 651, "voters": 43, "content": "The Right Way To Develop Your Ethereum Dapp is Here: DRIZZLE!Niharika SinghFollowDec 8, 2018 \u00b7 10 min readBefore starting: Please don\u2019t ask me why I put up those heavenly, mouth-watering desserts. I couldn\u2019t help it. Truffle guys chose very yummy names. I am sure these photos will make dev part more bewitching! \ud83d\ude09This article is inspired by Adrian Li\u2019s contribution to Truffle framework. Adrian\u2019s work can be found here. It is highly recommended that you do give it a read!So let\u2019s get started..Source: https://giphy.com/gifs/chris-pratt-jimmy-kimmel-rVbAzUUSUC6dOWhat is Drizzle?Drizzle was added to Truffle Suite in February 2018. It is Truffle\u2019s first front-end development tool. Of course, it is here to make developers life a lot easier. It makes use of React under the hood.What does Drizzle do?Synchronises your smart contract data with front-end seamlesslyMoving transaction data from blockchain to Redux store is easy.In this tutorial, true power of Drizzle will be demonstrated from scratch. It is probably the best way to gauge potential of a framework with gaining knowledge about how the entire mechanism functions under the hood.Before StartingBasic knowledge about truffle is required. (Not Drizzle!)Knowledge of JavaScript, ReactJSSetting up dev environmentNode.js v8+ LTS and npm. Npm version 5.2+.Truffle: npm install truffle -g. To check if it is installed properly, type truffle version on your terminal.Ganache-cli: npm install ganache-cli -g. Ganache will be used to spin up a personal, local Ethereum blockchain with dummy accounts for dev purpose.create-react-app: npm install create-react-app -g. Set up a modern React web app with a single command. Thanks to Facebook.Step 1: Create Truffle ProjectStep 1.1: Create your dev folder and move into it.$ mkdir drizzle-tutorial$ cd drizzle-tutorialStep 1.2 : Initialise truffle$ truffle initOutput will look like this:Downloading...Unpacking...Setting up...Unbox successful. Sweet!Commands:Compile:        truffle compileMigrate:        truffle migrateTest contracts: truffle testThis operation creates a basic project structure. Open drizzle-tutorial folder in any text editor.contracts/: Directory for Solidity smart contractsmigrations/: Directory for deployment filestest/: Directory for test files for testing your application and contractstruffle.js: Truffle configuration file (will be deprecated soon)truffle-config.js: Truffle configuration fileStep 2: Launch personal blockchain using GanacheOpen the terminal and run following command:ganache-cli -b 2-b stands for block time which is 2 seconds. In other words, this personal blockchain mines a new block every 2 seconds. This creates a fake time lag between when you request to commit a transaction and when it is actually committed. By default, Ganache does it instantly.This process runs on http://127.0.0.1:8545 by default. You can open up this RPC on metamask as well.Step 3: Writing a minimal smart contract and configuring the contractStep 3.1: Create a new file named Addition.sol in the contracts/ directory.pragma solidity ^0.4.24;contract Addition {  int public sum = 0;function add (int x, int y) public {    sum = x + y;  }}Step 3.2: To tell truffle where our personal blockchain (Ganache) is running, we have to do the followingIn truffle.js (if you\u2019re on windows truffle-config.js) do the following changes.module.exports = {  networks: {    development: {      host: \"localhost\",      port: 8545,      network_id: \"*\" // Match any network id    }  }};Step 4: Compiling and migrating smart contractStep 4.1: Compile smart contractFire up your terminal and run the command:truffle compileFollowing is the output of the command:Compiling ./contracts/Addition.sol...Compiling ./contracts/Migrations.sol...Writing artifacts to ./build/contractsStep 4.2: Migrate (deploy) them to our personal blockchainCreate a new file named 2_deploy_contracts.js in the migrations/directory.const Addition = artifacts.require(\"Addition\");module.exports = function(deployer) {  deployer.deploy(Addition);};In the terminal, run following command: truffle migrate. Make sure ganache is running. Also, make sure Solidity compiler used is up to date.Following is the output of the above command:Running migration: 1_initial_migration.jsDeploying Migrations...... 0x8c5942b90b785a51ccfe55dcbbc62e0f5469484b72f0ef5ee5fe21e8cef91d3cMigrations: 0x980b663f1cedfad76349e0c4da1e0c7405b1fd23Saving successful migration to network...... 0xe3b1ad2a400d341d894170b8930471ee6d7fcb50314993df3418b4b3a517ba03Saving artifacts...Running migration: 2_deploy_contracts.jsDeploying Addition...... 0x1629b636f1457d91350d5e069ca6a9e88fde72e3438ad9f6abb83c5dfa4675afAddition: 0x558c220aac56c27a21215bd77551a51e0070d1b6Saving successful migration to network...... 0xb3530be9102f4b2d914fd07dcdd51d10d7cbc496aab28b278ec35e4e4b476af3Saving artifacts...Step 5: Testing our contractTo validate if everything is working all right, let us Mocha test our contract.Create a new file named Addition.js in the test/ directory.const Addition = artifacts.require(\"./Addition.sol\");contract(\"Addition\", accounts => {  it(\"should display 5\", async () => {    const addition = await Addition.deployed();    await addition.add(3, 2, { from: accounts[0] });    const storedSum= await addition.sum.call();assert.equal(storedSum, 5);  });});Run the test using the command: truffle test. Following is the output:Awesome! Now we know that the contract actually works.Step 6: Creating ReactJS projectTo bootstrap a minimalistic react project, run the following command: npx create-react-app client. This may take a couple of minutes.This command will create client.Output will look like this. (This is not complete output because its hella long).Creating a new React app in /Users/niharikasingh/Desktop/playground/drizzle-tutorial/client.Installing packages. This might take a couple of minutes.Installing react, react-dom, and react-scripts...yarn add v1.10.0info No lockfile found.[1/4] \ud83d\udd0d  Resolving packages...warning react-scripts > eslint > file-entry-cache > flat-cache > circular-json@0.3.3: CircularJSON is in maintenance only, flatted is its successor.warning react-scripts > jest > jest-cli > prompts > kleur@2.0.2: Please upgrade to kleur@3 or migrate to 'ansi-colors' if you prefer the old syntax.

We have to link our smart contracts with this React project. We can copy the /build/contracts folder in client folder directly or use the following command:cd srcln -s ../../build/contracts contractsStep 7: Install Drizzle (YAY!)Before running the installation command, make sure you\u2019re in the client directory of your project. To do that, run cd .. in the terminal.To install Drizzle, run the following command which took me about 3 minutes to be precise:npm install drizzle --saveAND NO OTHER DEPENDENCY! How cool is that? No need to install Web3.js or anything else. Drizzle contains everything we need to work with our smart contracts.Run the React front-end on port 3000. To do this, run npm start. And point your browser to http://localhost:3000. The following page should come up.Step 8: Instantiate Drizzle StoreWe have to make some changes in client/src/index.js first.import React from \"react\";import ReactDOM from \"react-dom\";import \"./index.css\";import App from \"./App\";// import drizzle functions and contract artifactimport { Drizzle, generateStore } from \"drizzle\";import Addition from \"./contracts/Addition.json\";// let drizzle know what contracts we wantconst options = { contracts: [Addition] };// setup the drizzle store and drizzleconst drizzleStore = generateStore(options);const drizzle = new Drizzle(options, drizzleStore);// pass in the drizzle instanceReactDOM.render(<App drizzle={drizzle} />, document.getElementById(\"root\"));Note that the drizzle instance is passed into the App component as props.Step 9: Reshaping client/src/App.jsStep 9.1: Adding state variablesWe will do is to add the following line inside our App component:state = { loading: true, drizzleState: null };We are going to be using two state variables here:loading \u2014 Indicates if Drizzle has finished initializing and the app is ready. The initialization process includes instantiating web3 and our smart contracts, fetching any available Ethereum accounts and listening (or, in cases where subscriptions are not supported: polling) for new blocks.drizzleState \u2014 This is where we will store the state of the Drizzle store in our top-level component. If we can keep this state variable up-to-date, then we can simply use simple props and state to work with Drizzle (i.e. you don't have to use any Redux or advanced React patterns).Step 9.2: Writing some initialisation logiccomponentDidMount() {  const { drizzle } = this.props;  // subscribe to changes in the store  this.unsubscribe = drizzle.store.subscribe(() => {    // every time the store updates, grab the state from drizzle    const drizzleState = drizzle.store.getState();    // check to see if it's ready, if so, update local component state    if (drizzleState.drizzleStatus.initialized) {      this.setState({ loading: false, drizzleState });    }  });}Step 9.3: Unsubscribing from the storecompomentWillUnmount() {  this.unsubscribe();}This will safely unsubscribe when the App component un-mounts so we can prevent any memory leaks.Step 9.4: Modify render() methodrender() {  if (this.state.loading) return \"Loading Drizzle...\";  return <div className=\"App\">Drizzle is ready</div>;}The final file should look like this:import React, { Component } from 'react';import logo from './logo.svg';import './App.css';class App extends Component {  state = { loading: true, drizzleState: null };componentDidMount() {    const { drizzle } = this.props;// subscribe to changes in the store    this.unsubscribe = drizzle.store.subscribe(() => {// every time the store updates, grab the state from drizzle      const drizzleState = drizzle.store.getState();// check to see if it's ready, if so, update local component state      if (drizzleState.drizzleStatus.initialized) {        this.setState({ loading: false, drizzleState });      }    });  }compomentWillUnmount() {    this.unsubscribe();  }render() {    if (this.state.loading) return \"Loading Drizzle...\";    return <div className=\"App\">Drizzle is ready</div>;  }}export default App;After this, localhost:3000 should look like this:Step 10: Reading from smart contract using DrizzleCreate a new file at client/src/ReadSum.js and paste in the following:import React from \"react\";class ReadSum extends React.Component {  componentDidMount() {    const { drizzle, drizzleState } = this.props;    console.log(drizzle);    console.log(drizzleState);  }render() {    return <div>ReadSum Component</div>;  }}export default ReadSum;And then inside App.js, import the new component with this statement:import ReadSum from \"./ReadSum\";Change App.js render() method to the following:render() {  if (this.state.loading) return \"Loading Drizzle...\";  return (    <div className=\"App\">      <ReadSum        drizzle={this.props.drizzle}        drizzleState={this.state.drizzleState}      />    </div>  );}Looks like this in action:Now, let\u2019s actually read the value from our smart contract.import React from \"react\";class ReadSum extends React.Component {  state = { dataKey: null };componentDidMount() {    const { drizzle } = this.props;    const contract = drizzle.contracts.Addition;// let drizzle know we want to watch 'sum'    var dataKey = contract.methods[\"sum\"].cacheCall();// save the `dataKey` to local component state for later reference    this.setState({ dataKey });  }render() {    // get the contract state from drizzleState    const { Addition } = this.props.drizzleState.contracts;// using the saved `dataKey`, get the variable we're interested in    const sum = Addition.sum[this.state.dataKey];// if it exists, then we display its value    return <p>Sum: {sum && sum.value}</p>;  }}export default ReadSum;Step 11: Writing on the blockchain using DrizzleIf we wish to add two new numbers and store the sum on the blockchain, do the following:First, let\u2019s create a new file client/src/SetSum.js and paste in the following:import React from \"react\";class SetSum extends React.Component {  state = { stackId: null};handleKeyDown1 = e => {    // if the enter key is pressed, set the value with the string    if (e.keyCode === 13) {      this.setValue(e.target.value1);    }  };  handleKeyDown2 = f => {    // if the enter key is pressed, set the value with the string    if (f.keyCode === 13) {      this.setValue(f.target.value2);    }  };setValue = (value1, value2) => {    const { drizzle, drizzleState } = this.props;    const contract = drizzle.contracts.Addition;// let drizzle know we want to call the `add` method with `value1 and value2`    const stackId = contract.methods[\"add\"].cacheSend(this.textInput1.value, this.textInput2.value, {      from: drizzleState.accounts[0]    });// save the `stackId` for later reference    this.setState({ stackId });  };getTxStatus = () => {    // get the transaction states from the drizzle state    const { transactions, transactionStack } = this.props.drizzleState;// get the transaction hash using our saved `stackId`    const txHash = transactionStack[this.state.stackId];// if transaction hash does not exist, don't display anything    if (!txHash) return null;// otherwise, return the transaction status    return `Transaction status: ${transactions[txHash].status}`;  };render() {    return (      <div>        <input type=\"number\" ref={(input1) => this.textInput1 = input1} onKeyDown={this.handleKeyDown1} />        <input type=\"number\" ref={(input2) => this.textInput2 = input2} onKeyDown={this.handleKeyDown2} />        <div>{this.getTxStatus()}</div>      </div>    );

During the conversation he said to me:In some interviews it takes me 45 minutes to uncover the actual energy related to the switch. Then I feel like I don\u2019t have enough time left to get all of the details that I want.It turned into a fantastic discussion about how we can identify and articulate the tricks that we have at our disposal that can lead us to the energy that caused the consumer to change their behavior.I can\u2019t express in words how important this ability is. If you can pull this off your interviews will be rich with detail that you\u2019ll be scrambling to act on. If you can\u2019t \u2026 well let\u2019s just work on making sure that you can.Because most of us are product people, we get caught up in the product:Tell me about your old mattress. How did it compare to the new one? Was it softer/harder/lumpier? Now tell me about the mattress you have now \u2026The truth is, I don\u2019t care about the mattress. I care about the situation that he was in that caused him to think about abandoning the status-quo.It got to a point where I would be up at 4am searching online for mattresses because my back hurt so bad that I couldn\u2019t sleep.Holy cow! There\u2019s some energy! I can sell to that. I can craft marketing messages around it.But before we find that kind of gold we need to start our conversation with them and begin to zoom in. Below is a diagram that I sketched out to start to outline the questions (tricks) that I use to start at a high-level and begin to zoom in one the Jobs-to-be-Done timeline: the moment when they had the first thought that they needed to make progress, all the way through purchasing and using the product.At the beginning of the interview I don\u2019t know where that timeline is, and I have to set out to find it. Everything before it is status-quo (normal behavior) and everything after it is status-quo (the new habits/behaviors have been set / progress has been made).If the rust colored areas are the status-quo (business as usual), how do we ask questions to bracket the switch so that we can start to hunt for energy that is useful to us?I always start by trying to set the right bracket:What exactly did you buy? Do you remember the brand? What else do you remember about it? (model/features?)When did you buy it? Was it a weekend or weekday? Do you remember if it was before Thanksgiving or after?Then move to the left bracket (much tricker to find):When did you have the first thought that you needed something new? Do you remember a moment when you said to yourself, \u2018this mattress just isn\u2019t cutting it?\u2019From there it\u2019s up to me to decide if I believe them or if I need to keep moving back in time (the first thought that they shared with me isn\u2019t really the first thought \u2014 it\u2019s just the one that they remember most easily and I need to keep probing).Next StepsI know that with this post we\u2019re just beginning to scratch the surface of the tricks that are available to us. Over the next few weeks we\u2019re going to work to unpack the things that we do unknowingly to try to make them more concrete and usable for you.If you have tricks of your own, let us know.", "responses": 0, "tags": []}, {"title": "New York Experiences That Are Gradually Turning Me Socialist", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@kickinson/new-york-experiences-that-are-gradually-turning-me-socialist-11727c2189a?source=search_post", "author_name": "kelly dickinson", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@kickinson", "publish_date": "2017-06-29", "last_modified_date": "2018-02-02", "readtime": "1.70", "claps": 60, "voters": 51, "content": "New York Experiences That Are Gradually Turning Me Socialist\u201cthe truffle aioli is DIVINE\u201dkelly dickinsonFollowJun 29, 2017 \u00b7 2 min read\u201cdive\u201d barshearing someone at Union Square Cafe refer to a home-health aide as \u201cour girl\u201d in the Year of our Lord 2017the precocious eight year old on the L train wearing Beats (by Dre) and carrying a yoga mat on his lap, taking up two seatsa woman saying \u201cdining with the headmaster\u201d into her cell phone with nary a hint of ironyeveryone ELSE at Westside Market, but not methe fourteen-year-old kid in the waiting room of my therapist\u2019s office on the Upper East Side (this is where rich people live) wearing a MAGA shirt and explaining to his dad who is wearing a very fancy jacket exactly what the immigrants are stealing from hard-working Americansfinding out that someone named \u201cTripp\u201d existsplate-sharing fees\u201ctasting menus\u201d come the fuck onBushwick Tech Bros acting superior to Murray Hill Finance BrosBed-Stuy Art Bros acting superior to Bushwick Tech Broseverything between 11th Ave at West 14th St and 6th Ave at West Houston St.the publicly-available salaries of my friend\u2019s friend\u2019s friend\u2019s rich parents, which I googled late one night after a party trying to discern how mad I should be about him steamrolling a conversation we were having about systemic inequalitythe Zestimate of aforementioned friend\u2019s friend\u2019s friend\u2019s apartment paid for by aforementioned parentsbeing informed that Fries Don\u2019t Come With The Burger, You Actually Have To Order Them Separately, But They\u2019re Truffle Fries And REALLY, REALLY Worth It, We Promiseseeing a young lady on the train carrying an decently expensive tote bag that I have never in my life been flush enough to comfortably afford monogrammed with her name on it and being like \u201cwow, Caileigh really has her shit together\u201d and then hearing the woman say \u201cgood girl Caileigh\u201d and realizing that there is a dog in the bag and this is a DOG tote for DOGS and realizing that someone named their dog \u201cCaileigh\u201d which, like, really? just spell it some other way, i don\u2019t know, just seems ridiculous\u201ctartines\u201d it\u2019s toast you jackassesthe fact that people are calling \u201ctoast\u201d \u201ctoasts\u201d nowpeople who have summered abroad making jokes about the homeless on social mediaPeople Having Gone To Vassar just, like, as a conceptWilliamsburg", "responses": 6, "tags": ["New York", "Socialism", "Systemic Inequality", "Humor", "Eat The Rich"]}, {"title": "Ethereum, tokens & smart contracts.", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@k3no/ethereum-tokens-smart-contracts-80f639f5c46b?source=search_post", "author_name": "Keno Leon", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@k3no", "publish_date": "2017-10-28", "last_modified_date": "2019-07-23", "readtime": "11.1", "claps": 90, "voters": 25, "content": "Ethereum, tokens & smart contracts.Notes on getting started Part 10.

Smart Contracts.Part 5. Smarter Contracts.Part 6. Tokens & Inheritance.Part 7. ERC20 Token Standard.Part 8. Crowdfunding and ICOs.Part 9. Dapps & MetaMask.In this quasi finale note, I\u2019d like to check and cover a few related tools ( Remix, Truffle & TestRPC) I left these for last but not least since I believe it is better to have some basic knowledge about contracts, tokens, Dapps & compiling before using them, they can also be viewed as helpful tooling for becoming more productive writing smart contracts.REMIXSite : https://remix.ethereum.org/Docs : https://remix.readthedocs.io/en/latest/GitHub : https://github.com/ethereum/remixRemix is a debugger, compiler & IDE for smart contracts, it is very accesible since you can start working with the online version immediately and a provider ( like metaMask ).Note: Why not start with remix ? A lot of tutorials (including Ethereums ) recommend Remix as a starting point and that might work for some,I found it very confusing from the beginning, so I chose the path in these notes and I am glad I did since I believe working with clients, making your own compiler and interacting with the blockchain in other ways gives you a more robust foundation.Let\u2019s start by going to remix and opening basicStorage.sol contract from part 4 of this notes :You could of course create a new file and type it from scratch( or copy paste into remix) .Off the bat, remix proves useful by raising warnings\u2026In order to interact with the blockchain, you need to connect remix to it, here\u2019s how you would connect it to MetaMask by unlocking your account ( you could also use parity or mist), notice how remix pulls our account information\u2026Once connected you can deploy a contract with the create button:After creation, you will be asked by MetaMask to confirm the transaction as usual and then your contract transaction will be processed, notice you instantly get the getter and setter.If you want to copy the contract address use the small file copy icon, our contracts address is: 0x008b85cf793e9860aa24f2eab1f2008551f59b09You also get a console with the Tx History :Transaction Details:Transactions are simply done by the getter and setter in this example, for instance let\u2019s set x to 10,20,and 30:Each transaction gives you a lot of details by simply clicking the details button on the console.Debug and conquer.Another useful tool is the debugger. In order to use it you need to switch to the Javascript VM:In the Javascript VM you will not need to connect to a blockchain( notice you get 100 ether as a balance); it\u2019s a great way to try out your contracts before releasing them on a blockchain. ( Truffle + Test RPC which we will cover later being another more complex one).Another feature of the debugger is that of step debugging, you could for instance call the set method (10) and go through the VM machines inner processing ( it seems to have a limited stack, so take that into consideration) \u2026This is particularly helpful when estimating gas costs of transactions since they are displayed step by step, there are also warnings on gas costs at writing time which together work to help you manage gas on your transactions.Note: There seems to be a way of working with remix locally via cloning the repo and using geth as the backend, it is not fully documented or fleshed right now, but if you want to go that route check the remix repo for instructions.TRUFFLE + TestRPCSite: http://truffleframework.comDocs: http://truffleframework.com/docs/TestRPC: https://github.com/ethereumjs/testrpcTruffle is a very popular framework for developing smart contracts while TestRPC is a test and development focused Ethereum client, together they are meant to streamline and make writting smart contracts better and faster, let\u2019s see how they stack up.Setting Up :As is sometimes expected from more complex tooling, there is some setup to take care off before we begin\u2026Install TestRPC.Install Truffle.Init a project.Upon initializing your project via npm a series of files and folders are created:Basically folders for contracts, migrations and testing (which we\u2019ll explain soon),pre populated with sample code along with a config file (truffle.js). You can eventually delete some of it for clarity or import \u201ctruffle boxes\u201d with preconfigured contract templates.In use :Let\u2019s say we want to deploy and interact with one of our previous contracts through truffle, let\u2019s pick once more the basicStorage.sol we used for Remix as a minimal example, let\u2019s also clear the folder- file structure to the bare minimum, the result would be:Note: There are still a few extra files here that need explaining, contracts is where our contract ( basicStorage.sol ) lives, but there is also the Migrations.sol contract, this contract along with the file 1_initial_migration.js is required for the migration feature to work. - What is the Migration feature you ask?The Migration feature allows you to stage your deployments in incremental steps,add specific environmental variables and keep track of successful migrations, in Migrations.sol which is required in 1_initial_migrations.js, some of these features are initialized..In other words scaffolding for truffle's features, look here for an in depth discussion: Demystifying Truffle MigrateThe migrations folder is also where we store our deployment instructions: 2_deploy_contract.js  which we'll try now: Deploying :In order to deploy we need a deployer\u2026// File: 2_deploy_contract.jsvar basicStorage = artifacts.require(\"./basicStorage.sol\");module.exports = function(deployer) {  deployer.deploy(basicStorage);};The deployer file is handy for deploying one or multiple contracts and performing extra steps ( like calling a contract method) after deploying.Before deploying start TestRPC: $ testrpcAvailable Accounts==================(0) 0x64d37bd909091ecc8f97483065ce69e0e5a9ea57(1) 0xa646f9b0cf2cdaa5404f02cb4f8fcf0886ce75a2...etcListening on localhost:8545On another terminal or tab in your initialized Truffle directory (/minimal_truffle in my case)\u2026$ truffle migrateIf deployed succesfully you will get step by step logs on both your sessions:Interacting with contracts :To interact with our contract we first need to start Truffles console:$ truffle console$ .exit // to exit.Getting all the contract information:$ basicStorage.deployed().then(function(o){console.log(o)});Spews out a ton of information including the ABI,bytecode, methods and address (0xd32463887bfe0139eb03d817d795a03296955a04) in our case.Sending a transaction to our contract (notice the web3 syntax) :basicStorage.at(\"0xd32463887bfe0139eb03d817d795a03296955a04\").set.sendTransaction(72,{from:\"0x64d37bd909091ecc8f97483065ce69e0e5a9ea57\"});Calling our contract ( still web3 ):basicStorage.at(\"0xd32463887bfe0139eb03d817d795a03296955a04\").get.call();// Results in :{ [String: '72'] s: 1, e: 1, c: [ 72 ] }Doing this via Truffles console is not really an improvement over our previous node setup, so we need to figure out a better alternative\u2026 ( i.e. more setup).Running Scripts:To replicate what we just did in the console in script form, we need to create a new .js file ( I am doing so inside a scripts folder to keep things tidy ):// File: scripts/interactTruffle.jsmodule.exports = function(callback) {var basicStorage = artifacts.require(\"basicStorage\");basicStorage.deployed().then(function(instance) {    contract = instance;    console.log(contract);  })}// Note: the artifacts line, in Truffles parlance it is a contract abstraction and it encapsulates your contract for use within Truffles framework, the equivalent of instantiating a contract with an ABI and/or Bytecode in web3,for an in depth look and extra features check out truffle-contract ( the abstraction module )And to run it on a terminal in you Truffle directory\u2026$ truffle exec scripts/interactTruffle.jsNote: You will need to run again truffle migrate if you closed your previous session and change contract & account variables....Spews out a ton of information including the ABI,bytecode, methods and address like before.By running scripts we can now automate and standarize repetitive or complex interactions with contracts, for instance let\u2019s start by using set() & get() together\u2026module.exports = function(callback) {var account = \"0xf8c09220dfc59e74727c9db4d58df8ae120d2e93\";  var basicStorage = artifacts.require(\"basicStorage\");  var contractInstance = basicStorage.at(\"0x27974f214310b7977492396f981a93c930297f81\");contractInstance.set.sendTransaction(10, {    from: account  }).then(function(result) {    console.log(result);    // tx : 0x5d899a8a22b4a1599728c6b3fb772d64492f6a94d78365ef88330fb910f06bed    contractInstance.get.call().then(function(result){      console.log(result);    // { [String: '10'] s: 1, e: 1, c: [ 10 ] }      });  });}Note we are using the deployed contract Instance at a specific address, also the use of promises for flow.And a more complex one where we use set and call 3 times in succesion\u2026// File: scripts/102030.jsmodule.exports = function(callback) {var account = \"0xc9b3bb2bd6d3ebd4ebf9816052cd84da5c61c116\";  var basicStorage = artifacts.require(\"basicStorage\");  var contractInstance = basicStorage.at(\"0xe32d1865f5e37a20b4b3cf3939cc247a27ff302d\");contractInstance.set.sendTransaction(10, {    from: account  }).then    contractInstance.get.call().then(function(result){      console.log(result);  }).then  contractInstance.set.sendTransaction(20, {    from: account  }).then    contractInstance.get.call().then(function(result){      console.log(result);  }).then  contractInstance.set.sendTransaction(30, {    from: account  }).then    contractInstance.get.call().then(function(result){      console.log(result);  });}// String: 10, 20 ,30Note the use of chained promises. This is more useful, for starters we don\u2019t need to be online, and second we can script,log and debug complex behavior with minimal effort beyond the original setup and Truffles learning curve.Testing in TruffleRunning scripts is one way of testing your contracts, but more likely you will want to do some unit testing, Truffle allows you to do so in a number of ways:In Js, Truffle uses Mocha as the test library and Chai for assertions, here\u2019s a minimal and silly example with our basicStorage contract:// File: test/basicStorage.js var basicStorage = artifacts.require(\"basicStorage\");var song = '';// var song = 'la la la';contract('basicStorage', function() {  it(\"should sing you a song !\", function() {    assert(song !== '', 'I have no song');  })});                     - - - - - - - - - - - - To run ( on your Truffle folder ) :$ truffle testResults:Like with scripts, you first need to import your contract ( the artifacts line), the rest employs a standard unit testing syntax ( except you use contract() instead of describe() ).Moving on, here\u2019s a more realistic test with a deployed contract and method testing( note that testrpc accounts is included just by adding it to the contract):var basicStorage = artifacts.require(\"basicStorage\");var testValue = 10;contract('basicStorage', function(accounts) {it(\"set & get methods should work\", function() {    return basicStorage.deployed().then(function(instance) {      return instance.set.sendTransaction(testValue, {        from: accounts[0]      }).then(function() {        return instance.get.call().then(function(result) {          assert(result == testValue, 'get value is not set value');        });      });    });  });});\u2713 set & get methods should work (64ms)1 passing (83ms)This small example shows how to test for methods on deployed contracts, and much like scripts uses promises to control the flow of information, just make sure to use return at each step that needs to be included in the test ( you can also use async/await for a somehow cleaner syntax ).Testing with solidity: The other way that Truffle allows you to test your contracts is with solidity via .sol files that run next to the previously discussed tests, a simple example would look like this:// File : TestbasicStorage.solpragma solidity ^0.4.2;import \"truffle/Assert.sol\";import \"truffle/DeployedAddresses.sol\";import \"../contracts/basicStorage.sol\";contract TestbasicStorage {basicStorage bs = new basicStorage();function testInitialBalance() {      Assert.balanceIsZero(bs, 'Assert failed');    }}Results:TestbasicStorage\u2713 testInitialBalance (60ms)Contract: basicStorage\u2713 set & get methods should work (62ms)2 passing (583ms)Solidity tests are basically contracts with an Assertion interface (another contract) , and they seem to work closer to the base contract which allows you to test somethings like balances & functions in a simpler way,the difference is nuanced but might come in handy if you feel you are drowning in promises with the Js tests,check the Assert.sol contract to look at what\u2019s possible. It was also brought to my attention that with solidity tests you can test behavior when contracts interact with each other, not when Truffle interacts with contracts, but that is an advanced subject best left for later\u2026To recap, Remix and Truffle ( + test RPC ) are 2 very capable tools for testing your smart contracts, remix is a bare bones affair whereas Truffle brings the smart contract kitchen sink along with a considerable learning curve, I believe that rather than go for one vs the other, a combination of both along with bare node + web3 ( or a wrapper like ethjs) for deploying on testnets could cover all the bases. I should also mention that these tools are in active development and new ones might become available in the near future. For now I would like to close these notes on getting started with a collection of intermediate subjects which will be the subject of next notes, for now, let\u2019s summarize the road traveled so far:Look how far you\u2019ve come !Notes Part 1 : Setting up : Getting a wallet/client , connecting to a test Ethereum blockchain and getting some test ether.Notes Part 2: web3.js/node : Interacting with the blockchain through web3.js and node for more convenience and ease of development.Notes Part 3: Solidity : Installing solidity (Ethereums contract writing language ) , Creating a very basic contract, compiling it, deploying it to the blockchain ( the test one) and interacting with it.Notes Part 4: Smart Contracts : We modified our simple contract so we could store and retrieve information (making it smart), in the process we also covered how to watch the blockchain and contracts and finally we took a look at gas and how to estimate it.Notes Part 5: Smarter Contracts: In order to allow contracts more complex behavior (make them smarter) , we need to delve a bit deeper into contract creation via constructors and a few more complex types which we will use in making a token contract.Notes Part 6: Tokens & Inheritance : We made our first Token and interacted with it by transferring some of it from one account to another, we also briefly covered inheritance which is used in more complex contracts.Notes Part 7: ERC20 Token Standard : We made and deployed an erc20 token which can be considered the parting standard for working sub currencies. We examined the code and talked about transfers in between tokens.Notes Part 8: Crowdfunding and ICOs : We explored the subject of crowdfunding via smart contracts in the form of ICOs and the exchange of ether for tokens, we made contracts that can receive ether, collect ether and can be used for exchanging ether and creating an unlimited supply of tokens.Notes Part 9: Dapps & MetaMask : We looked into what a Dapp is and where we are in terms of development ( very early), we then introduced MetaMask which helps make Dapps accessible in the browser , we looked at various ways to interact with MetaMask via Javascript and we integrated them into a fully fledged test Dapp that uses our previously made token smart contract, we also touched on the future of Dapps and server implementations.Notes part 10: Remix/Truffle/TestRPC (This post): A look into Ethereums current tooling ecosystem, Remix, which allows you to quickly validate contracts online, testRPC which recreates an offline blockchain in your computer, and Truffle, which has a bit of a learning curve in exchange for complex testing and deploying options.\u2728\u2728  Now a Book !  \u2728\u2728If you are looking for an introduction to Ethereum, Solidity and Smart Contracts these notes were edited and revised into a convenient book !Available in ebook and paperback:https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078CQ8L7VGet it ! \ud83d\ude4f \ud83d\ude0aCheers !KenoAbout the Author :Born Eugenio Noyola Leon (Keno) I am a Designer,Web Developer/programmer, Artist and Inventor, currently living in Mexico City, you can find me at www.k3no.com", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Smart Contracts", "Software Development", "ICO", "Cryptocurrency"]}, {"title": "Building A Dice Game DApp On The Ethereum Blockchain", "post_link": "https://medium.com/crowdbotics/building-a-dice-game-dapp-on-the-ethereum-blockchain-7c6ba17f30ba?source=search_post", "author_name": "Gaurav Agrawal", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@gaurav.agrawal", "publish_date": "2018-11-19", "last_modified_date": "2019-06-13", "readtime": "7.18", "claps": 197, "voters": 21, "content": "Building A Dice Game DApp On The Ethereum BlockchainExploring interesting use cases for the Ethereum blockchain by building a simple dice roll DApp game with Truffle Framework.Gaurav AgrawalFollowNov 19, 2018 \u00b7 8 min read\u2018DApp\u2019 is an abbreviation for Decentralized app. DApps are a new paradigm for building apps where a back end centralized server is replaced by a decentralized peer to peer network.Industry-wide, we\u2019re just beginning to scratch the surface of potential blockchain use cases. Most people associate \u2018blockchain\u2019 with \u2018cryptocurrencies,\u2019 but new use cases for blockchain technology are emerging everyday.Today, I\u2019ll show you how to build a simple dice game with Ethereum as a means to explore different and interesting uses cases for blockchain technology.What is an Ethereum DApp?Ethereum DApps build on Ethereum blockchain technology, where Ethereum serves as the backend for the application.One of the most popular DApps, cryptokitties, is collectibles-style game built on Ethereum. When we build a game with Ethereum, essentially, each game action and transaction is stored on the Ethereum blockchain.Roll the Dice DAppLet\u2019s create a simple dice roll game.\u2018Player\u2019 will roll the dice and chance to win 0.00001 ether. \u2018Target\u2019 will be set between 1 to 6.You can try our Roll the Dice here.

Let\u2019s have a look at the code:struct Bet{  uint8  currentBet; // this is target  bool  isBetSet; //default value is false   uint8  destiny; //  }mapping(address => Bet) private bets;uint8 private randomFactor;We will define Bet structure as having 3 variables:currentBet : This is used to set a new bet.isBetSet : To check if the bet is set or not?destiny : Contains the number when you roll the dice.We will also create mapping which will track the bets of players, and add a randomFactor, which will be used to randomize our results.Events: We have 2 events, one will emit when the bet is set for a player and other is for the game result. Events help in conveying state change on the frontend.event NewBetIsSet(address bidder , uint8 currentBet);event GameResult(address bidder, uint8 currentBet , uint8 destiny);Getting a new betTo take a bet from a new player, we will perform the following steps:Check if a bet is already set for the playerMark the bet as set nowGet the random number and set the current betEmit \u2018 NewBetIsSet\u2019 event and return the current betfunction getNewbet() public returns(uint8){  require(bets[msg.sender].isBetSet == false);  bets[msg.sender].isBetSet = true;  bets[msg.sender].currentBet = random();  randomFactor += bets[msg.sender].currentBet;  emit NewBetIsSet(msg.sender, bets[msg.sender].currentBet);  return bets[msg.sender].currentBet; }Rolling the DiceNext, we will roll the dice. For this, we will perform the following steps:Check if a bet is set for the playerGet the random number and set the destinyMark the isBetSet variable falseCheck if currentbet and destiny is equal, if yes transfer the prize(0.00001 ether) to the player and emit the GameResult event.Else only emit the GameResult event if currentBet and destiny is not equal.function roll() public returns(address , uint8 , uint8){  require(bets[msg.sender].isBetSet == true);  bets[msg.sender].destiny = random();  randomFactor += bets[msg.sender].destiny;  bets[msg.sender].isBetSet = false;  if(bets[msg.sender].destiny == bets[msg.sender].currentBet){   msg.sender.transfer(100000000000000);   emit GameResult(msg.sender, bets[msg.sender].currentBet, bets[msg.sender].destiny);     }else{   emit GameResult(msg.sender, bets[msg.sender].currentBet, bets[msg.sender].destiny);  }  return (msg.sender , bets[msg.sender].currentBet , bets[msg.sender].destiny); }We are adding destiny and currentBet to our randomFactor every time. This helps us randomize our bets efficiently.Other than above core functions, we have an isBetSet function to tell if the bet is set for a player and a random function to get random numbers for our dice.function isBetSet() public view returns(bool){  return bets[msg.sender].isBetSet; }function random() private view returns (uint8) { uint256 blockValue = uint256(blockhash(block.number-1 +    block.timestamp));        blockValue = blockValue + uint256(randomFactor);        return uint8(blockValue % 5) + 1; }Fallback Function: We will also add a fallback function. This function is executed if a contract is called and no other function matches the specified function identifier, or if no data is supplied. These functions are also executed whenever a contract would receive plain Ether, without any data.function() public payable{}Note: You should test your smart contract. You can learn more about testing smart contracts in some of our previous tutorials.Truffle frameworkWe will use Truffle framework to develop our DApp. Truffle has prebuilt packages which they call boxes. Truffle boxes help in getting the boilerplate code to develop a DApp. You can check more about truffle boxes here. We will use basic pet-box which will give us the boilerplate code for Dice game DApp. You can learn more about truffle pet-box here.Let\u2019s walk through app.js and understand what's happening on the frontend.We will define our app variable and declare variables we will use throughout app.js.We will also add an \u2018init\u2019 function in which will initialize web3 provider. Web3 provider allows your application to communicate with an Ethereum Node.MetaMask, an ethereum chrome extension wallet, will inject web3.js. Here, we will see if any web3 provider already exists. If not, it will try to connect a local blockchain. For testing purposes, we will run ganache on our local machine and connect to it.App = {  web3Provider: null,  contracts: {},  account: '0x0',  hasVoted: false,init: function() {    return App.initWeb3();  },initWeb3: function() {    if (typeof web3 !== 'undefined') {      // If a web3 instance is already provided by Meta Mask.      App.web3Provider = web3.currentProvider;      web3 = new Web3(web3.currentProvider);    } else {      App.web3Provider = new Web3.providers.HttpProvider('http://localhost:8545');      web3 = new Web3(App.web3Provider);    }    return App.initContract();  },Getting Dice ContractTruffle petbox gives us truffle-contract.js which gives us the boilerplate code to interact with the contract. We use ABI (Application Programming Interface), a JSON representation of our contractl to interact with our contract on the frontend.If we don\u2019t use truffle we manually need to change this ABI every time when change and compile our contract. Whenever you compile a solidity smart contract, it will generate a JSON file. This JSON file is ABI to interact with the smart contract.initContract: function() {    $.getJSON(\"Dice.json\", function(dice) {      // Instantiate a new truffle contract from the artifact      App.contracts.Dice = TruffleContract(dice);      // Connect provider to interact with contract      App.contracts.Dice.setProvider(App.web3Provider);App.listenForEvents();return App.render();    });  },We now get the Dice.json file, which is JSON representation of our smart contract. We initiate our Dice contract and set the web3.provider. truffle-contract.js are helping us here by providing TruffleContract function. You can check Dice.json and truffle-contract.js for more details.Listening EventsEvents are a crucial part of any DApp.Asynchronous and blockchain transactions take time. Events help us in tracking the status inside the DApp.We will change our interface to show changes to users. We are listening to both events GameResult and NewBetIsSet and passing event object to render UI accordingly.listenForEvents: function() {    App.contracts.Dice.deployed().then(function(instance) {      instance.GameResult({}, {}).watch(function(error, event) {        console.log(\"event triggered\", event)        // Reload when a new vote is recorded        App.render(event);      });    instance.NewBetIsSet({}, {}).watch(function(error, event) {        console.log(\"event triggered\", event)        // Reload when a new vote is recorded        App.render(event);      });});  },Check render method. We are checking events and showing results to users accordingly and also we are calling isBetSet method to know if a bet is set for a user or not.render: function(event) {    var gameInstance;    // Load account data    web3.eth.getCoinbase(function(err, account) {      if (err === null) {        App.account = account;        $(\"#accountAddress\").html(\"Your Account : \" + account );      }    });if(event.event == \"NewBetIsSet\"){    $(\"#newBet\")      .text(\"Your target is : \" + event.args.currentBet.toNumber());    }if(event.event == \"GameResult\") {        var destiny = event.args.destiny.toNumber();      var currentBet = event.args.currentBet.toNumber();      var doWeHaveAWinner = (destiny == currentBet);      if(doWeHaveAWinner){          $(\"#result\").text(\"we have a winner\");      }else{          $(\"#result\").text(\"Sorry bad luck, your got \" + destiny);      }    }// Load contract data    App.contracts.Dice.deployed().then(function(instance) {      gameInstance = instance;      return gameInstance.isBetSet();    }).then(function(isBetSet) {      var message = $(\"#message\");      if(isBetSet){        message.text('Bet is Set, Roll the Dice')      }else{      message.text('Set New Bet');    }    }).catch(function(error) {      console.warn(error);    });  }Also, we are defining roll and getNewBet method which we are calling from index.html on button clicks.roll : function(){    App.contracts.Dice.deployed().then(function(instance) {      return instance.roll({ from: App.account });    }).then(function(result) {    }).catch(function(err) {      console.error(err);    });  },getNewBet: function() {    $(\"#result\").text(\"\");    App.contracts.Dice.deployed().then(function(instance) {      return instance.getNewbet({ from: App.account });    }).then(function(result) {       }).catch(function(err) {      console.error(err);    });  }Deploying our DappWe will use ganache for deploying our DApp locally. If you don\u2019t have ganache, you can download it here. Run the commands below to deploy our contracts.truffle compiletruffle migrate --resetThis will deploy our smart contract to interact with the smart contract you can use truffle console command.Full codeYou can see full code for our dice game here.You can play around with the live DApp here.ImprovementThere are a lot of improvements which can be made to our Dice apart from UI.Here are a few suggested improvements which you add to your version of the Game.Optimize the memory. There is no need to story destiny, you can remove that.Optimize the amount of Gas we are using.Add a withdraw function to take out the extra ether from the contract.Make random function better. Generating random numbers on blockchains are itself a challenge as everything on blockchain is public.Improve the UI. Make it roll \ud83d\ude03ConclusionDApps are a new paradigm to for building applications on the internet, and we\u2019re just scratching the surface. Instead of hosting an app on Heroku, we can host our app on IPFS (decentralize peer to peer file system).DApps decentralize the way we interact on the internet. DApps run on decentralized networks, in our case Ethereum blockchain, but not every DApp needs to be built with a blockchain.In the future, you will see more Dapps with awesome UX and better use cases.

I hope it\u2019s truffles! Lots and lots of truffles! I hope they shove truffles down these bastards\u2019 throats till they choke \u2014 if that\u2019s not too aggressive.Anyway Henry and Anna are born and bred country folk who like standing in water and digging in the ground like pigs for fungus. They also have a dog which I guess goes well with truffles.The siblings drive to the shops, while Anna explains her dreams of serving a meal that doesn\u2019t cause anyone to vomit. Henry reveals that he can\u2019t think of anyone besides Anna who he would rather be competing in MKR with. The unspoken implication is that he can\u2019t think of anyone at all, because Anna is the only person he knows.Cut to Olga and Valeria who inform us that Anna and Henry seem like \u201csimple people\u201d. Cut to Georgie and Alicia who inform us that they don\u2019t see Anna and Henry as a threat. Here ends the standard Bitch Montage.Anna and Henry are buying various ingredients from the supermarket that crush our hopes of seeing three courses of pure unadorned truffles. They then go to pick up some venison, as they plan to serve a particularly cute main course.Arriving home, they decorate their instant restaurant, suffering from the same delusion as everyone else on MKR: that the decorations are of any significance whatsoever. Nobody scores on the decor, nobody cares about the decor, the decor adds nothing to anyone\u2019s experience including the home viewer, so why anyone bothers I have no idea. Anyway their instant restaurant is called Black Diamond, because they\u2019re big fans of Kiss and every course will be based on a different Kiss song. Anna and Henry rush upstairs to put on their Kiss costumes, and then begin preparing dinner.Anna is just a country girl, she\u2019s not polished or fancy or anything like that \u2014 or so she CLAIMS. She\u2019s just lulling us into a false sense of security, no doubt, by complaining at length about the high heels she\u2019s wearing. Nobody seems to be holding a gun to her head and ordering her to wear high heels, so no sympathy from me: just don\u2019t wear them. Nobody can even see your feet when you\u2019re serving dinner.With 32 minutes to go, I dunno, they\u2019ve done stuff with truffles and bread and things I guess. Cooking, you know?Tragedy now strikes as we are forced to listen to Pat and Louisa. Louisa refers to Henry as her future husband, so she\u2019s really staking out her claim as the Off-Putting One of this series.As the guests arrive, Georgie and Alicia express their doubts that people from Tasmania can actually make food or live in houses or wear shoes. \u201cI dunno if they\u2019re gonna just serve bangers and mash with truffles,\u201d says Georgie, like some kind of utter arsehole. I imagine they edited out the bit where asked whether they have indoor plumbing.We now get a \u201cbonus extra\u201d in the middle of the ad break, which is an MKR innovation for which the producers deserve some kind of criminal indictment. Your bonus extras are a disgrace you vampires.The guests arrive. Sonya says that Henry looks good when he opens the door. He\u2019s definitely one of those guys who the act of door-opening suits. Everyone is amazed by the instant restaurant and its sophisticated theme of death and decay.Why won\u2019t they play Black Diamond by Kiss on the soundtrack? Ridiculous missed opportunity.Henry and Anna explain to the guests that they are obsessed with fungus and incapable of talking about anything else. Sonya and Hadil discuss how much they want to fuck Henry. Someone makes a \u201cfun guy\u201d joke in violation of several UN treaties. Pat claims to be happy about all the different ethnicities around the table, because she has nothing else to be happy about, with a daughter like Louisa.Davide and Marco \u2014 Marco! That\u2019s his name! \u2014 mention how good-looking Matt and Aly are. Marco invites us to imagine a muscular baby sliding out of Aly, even though he just ate. Georgie and Alicia are still calling Davide and Marco \u201cMario and Luigi\u201d even though there is no resemblance whatsoever. Marco DOES look like a really fat Chris Pratt, but nobody seems to have noticed this.Around the table everyone sniffs the truffles at the table. Olga says that truffles are the most expensive dirt and fungi in the world, because she isn\u2019t sure which they are. Olga doesn\u2019t believe that something is good just because it\u2019s expensive, but she\u2019s proof that something isn\u2019t good just because it\u2019s cheap either.Manu and Pete arrive in slow motion, to pad out the running time. Henry and Anna present their menu: for entree, truffles; for main, truffles stuffed with venison; for dessert, a frozen truffle.Georgie and Alicia are 100 percent certain they can cook better than Henry and Anna, who haven\u2019t cooked yet, because their menu is \u201cfarm food\u201d. Georgie and Alicia are dicks and proud of it. \u201cNot everyone can just use truffle, because it\u2019s expensive,\u201d says Georgie. Alicia chimes in with the stunning insight that \u201csome people might not like it\u201d.Entree is served. \u201cLooks like a lot of truffle,\u201d says Matt, who as a serving member of the defence force, has no doubt had all the truffles he can stand in his life.Manu gives his assessment. \u201cIf you don\u2019t know how to use truffle properly, it\u2019s not that good,\u201d he explains, to distinguish truffles from foods like chicken and tomatoes, which taste wonderful when cooked by someone who doesn\u2019t know how. \u201cYou would hope that someone who worked on a truffle farm would know what to do with it,\u201d he says, and then holds up an empty plate, saying, \u201cThis is what I think of it.\u201d Oh no! He hates it so much he wishes he had been served an empty plate instead! Disaster for the Tassie farmers!Oh wait \u2014 actually he loved it! What a rollercoaster this show is to be sure! Manu says it\u2019s the best dish he\u2019s had in the nine years he\u2019s been doing the show, which sure, it\u2019s a low bar, but still, not bad.Valeria stares straight ahead, like a woman watching her house burn down. Most of the table seems to enjoy the entree though: Dan says he wants five more kilos of it, the disgusting pig. Olga and Valeria disagree, or rather they disagree but lie so they can be mean. Davide doesn\u2019t finish his, but Marco finishes it for him and everyone laughs because Marco is the Fat One. Then Valeria whines about the bread. \u201cYou can do better?\u201d asks Pete. \u201cI can,\u201d Valeria lies.In the kitchen, Henry and Anna, oblivious to the loathsomeness on display in the dining room, don\u2019t want to burn the truffle, because they are naturally unadventurous and dull. Why NOT burn the truffle? Live a little, for god\u2019s sake! Anna is excited to serve truffle mash, and even more excited to say \u201ctruffle mash\u201d a few dozen times.\u201cVenison can go one of two ways,\u201d reveals Alicia: presumably, it can either be served for dinner or flee with terror into the woods. Dan thinks it\u2019s pretty ballsy serving truffle again for the main, and given his haircut, he\u2019s a man who knows ballsy.Hadil now informs the rest of the table that her sister wishes to fuck Henry. Louisa begins to fidget, panicking that she won\u2019t be able to fuck Henry. Valeria reveals that her type is \u201cbad guys\u201d, by which she means \u201cguys with sufficiently bad judgment\u201d.In the kitchen, the venison is still a bit raw, much like Louisa\u2019s emotions. There is a fine line between good venison and bad venison, according to Henry, but what would he know: his venison is still a bit raw. He is freaking out. Anna remains relatively calm because she took the precaution of downing a slab before they started.Back at the table, the discussion refuses to move on from the subject of how fuckable Henry is and who is going to fuck him. Will it be Sonya or Louisa? Surely the only reasonable way to settle is to see whose instant restaurant scores higher, and give Henry to them.In the kitchen Henry is stoked and Anna is trying to make the truffle mash look like a nice lump. Coincidentally, in the dining room guests are discussing what a nice lump Henry himself is.Main is served. Manu and Pete eat daintily from their dishes of venison, while Dan barely restrains himself from pouncing at them, stealing their meat and kissing them all over.Amazingly, Anna and Henry are also very good at cooking venison. It\u2019s a weird sensation unfamiliar to the regular MKR viewer: a team that cooks food that people like to eat.Now over to Georgie, who says there\u2019s not enough salt in her mashed potato, apparently with no sense of obvious shame. And then over to Valeria, who makes dumb faces and says dumb things.Time to make dessert while being interrupted by Sonya and Hadil, who bring the dishes into the kitchen and distract them by rubbing their scent glands all over Henry. \u201cAre you dating anybody, Henry?\u201d asks Hadil. Henry replies in the negative and laughs nervously to cover his terror.Oh yeah, Dan and Gemma are still around.In the kitchen, Henry busily scoops the ice cream into balls, while Anna prepares to burn the crumble. In the dining room, Georgie and Alicia explain how they would make this dessert better than Henry and Anna, whose dessert they have yet to see or taste. Olga and Valeria explain that everyone is wrong about the first two courses being good as actually they were bad. These two teams should join forces to open a restaurant where you never eat anything but the wait staff constantly mock you for your choices.Anna takes out the burnt crumble and finds it has been expertly burnt, before suddenly remembering that it wasn\u2019t supposed to be burnt. Whoops! Her mistake was leaving the crumble in the oven too long \u2014 that was a gamble that didn\u2019t pay off this time, but good on her for trying something.\u201cSo far we\u2019ve gone so well, we can\u2019t afford to fall at the last hurdle,\u201d says Anna, even though the fact that so far they\u2019ve gone so well is exactly why they CAN afford to fall at the last hurdle. It\u2019s when you\u2019ve stuffed everything up that you can\u2019t afford to stuff up another thing.They strive to salvage the dessert, and serve it. Olga and Valeria complain that the presentation is messy but by this stage their credibility is in tatters and they can be rightly considered vexatious litigants.Pete liked the dessert but didn\u2019t love it. There wasn\u2019t enough ice cream for him, which is a strange thing to say for a man who claims dairy will kill your children. Matt enjoys the dessert, as it reminds him of the famous crumble and ice cream of the Swat Valley. Valeria doesn\u2019t think raisins belong in the crumble, because she is a giant swollen intestinal abscess of a woman.Now it is time for the scores, after a brief interlude for the voiceover man to violently manhandle his own genitals.Some teams give nines. Some give eights \u2014 including the Russians and Georgie and Alicia, which doesn\u2019t make any SENSE, dammit. If you\u2019re going to spend all night talking shit about the food, have the frigging balls to carry that through to the scores. Also Davide and Marco only give them a seven, because I don\u2019t think they were paying attention.Anyway in the end Henry and Anna get 58 out of 70 from the guests and 49 out of 60 from the judges which makes the total 107, which is much much better than any of the floundering halfwits in Group One managed. On the other hand, they are also currently on the bottom of the leaderboard, so it\u2019s precarious.Tune in tomorrow, when Dan and Gemma insist they are still on the show.My Patreon is here.

Drizzle aims to solve a state oriented problem; the problem of keeping chain data in sync with your dapp state, and therefore your UI up to date for the end user.Up until recently developers had to figure out the best approach to sync on-chain activity \u2014 contract state, events and transactions \u2014 to their dapps via vanilla web3. With the Drizzle package this added consideration is no longer necessary. Drizzle subscribes to new block headers and listens to changes to contract state \u2014 contracts that you specifically give Drizzle to listen to. State changes are then persisted automatically with a Redux store.As such, Drizzle works particularly well with React. This article aims to get you up to speed with Drizzle; we will install the Drizzle Truffle Box, exploring the project\u2019s capabilities in its current incarnation, as well as out-of-the-box components Drizzle developers have provided us.Drizzle is a part of the Truffle suite, so some background general knowledge of the suite will be beneficial in following this article. Read my introductory article to understand the dapp development pipeline in relation to the Truffle suite:Introduction to the Truffle Suite and Dapp Development PipelineBreaking down the Ethereum Dapp Development pipeline using Truffle, Ganache and Drizzlemedium.comThe Drizzle Truffle BoxThe fastest way to get started with Drizzle is by downloading the Drizzle Truffle Box, a package consisting of a Create React App environment combined withdrizzle, drizzle-react and drizzle-react-components, giving us access to the full set of Drizzle capabilities within a bootstrapped React app.Do you need to use React in order to use Drizzle? No \u2014 and this is why the Drizzle experience has been broken down into 3 packages, giving developers the option to integrate it into any front end framework they happen to be using.Let\u2019s quickly run down the purpose of these 3 packages:drizzle: The core functionality of hosting a \u201creactive datastore\u201d for web3 and smart contracts. Reactive datastore meaning a Redux store that automatically updates when changes are made to your smart contract state. Any Javascript application that has adopted (or plans to adopt) a Redux state container can go ahead and require drizzle as a dependency.drizzle-react: Abstracts the core Drizzle functionality into usable React components. Drizzle takes advantage of React\u2019s Context API for easier integration through your component tree. More on Context next.drizzle-react-components: Not a requirement to get Drizzle to work, but a set of useful UI components that may come in handy during development, currently consisting of LoadingContainer, ContractData and ContractForm components.At this point it is worth taking a quick detour on Context in React to understand how drizzle-react expects us to integrate the drizzle object into our projects. Let\u2019s do that next.Quick React Context explanationReact\u2019s Context API, (React 16.3 and up) allows us to pass objects down a component tree without embedding them as props throughout the entire component tree. Instead, we wrap that tree with a Context component, making context objects accessible throughout that hierarchy.Imagine a scenario where we are passing a single string value down 2 or more components. Just passing one value through a component tree is a tedious job. Now, let\u2019s see how a Context Provider can solve this:const ThemeContext = React.createContext('light');class App extends React.Component {  //Wrap your component tree with a Context provider.  render() {    return (      <ThemeContext.Provider value=\"dark\">        <Toolbar />      </ThemeContext.Provider>    );  }}function Toolbar(props) {  return (    <div><ThemedButton /></div>  );}//Children of your Context provider now have access to provider valueclass ThemedButton extends React.Component {  static contextType = ThemeContext;  render() {    return <Button theme={this.context} />;  }}First and foremost, a context object is defined with a default value: light. This value can be expanded to an object, array, or any valid type that you require. For example:const NameOfContext = React.createContext({theme: 'light'});A special Provider subcomponent of our context object can then be included in our component tree, as well as a value overwriting the default context value we defined above:<NameOfContext.Provider value={theme: 'dark'}\">    <ComponentTree /></NameOfContext.Provider>Now, anywhere in our component tree, we can refer to the context we need (as there may be many contexts embedded in our hierarchy) via the static contextType object, and access the context value like so:class DeepTreeComponent extends React.Component {  static contextType = NameOfContext;  render() {    return <Button theme={this.context.theme} />;  }}The official React docs provide a more detailed explanation of Context as well as alternatives to context when a better solution can be utilised. Check out that page here.Context applied to DrizzleNow, how is this knowledge of Context applied to Drizzle? Well, a drizzle object firstly needs to be initialised within our root component (or the top-most layer you wish drizzle to be accessible to). From here it would be nice if our entire app had access to the drizzle object \u2014 that\u2019s where a Context comes into play:...const drizzle = new Drizzle(options, drizzleStore);ReactDOM.render(  <DrizzleContext.Provider drizzle={drizzle}>    <App />  </DrizzleContext.Provider>,  document.getElementById('root'));We now know what the Drizzle box consists of and how we can use context to make Drizzle accessible in our React dapp. Let\u2019s continue our talk by installing the Drizzle Truffle box.The Drizzle Truffle BoxIntsallationLet\u2019s move onto installing drizzle from the Drizzle box. Run the following commands to do so:#install truffle and ganache cli if you have not done sonpm install -g trufflenpm install -g ganache-cli#unpack the drizzle truffle boxtruffle unbox drizzle#change ganache recommended block time:ganache-cli -b 3Why have we changed to a 3 second block time? Because we want to mimic more realistic blockchain to dapp communication. Ganache by default mines blocks instantly; any loading indicators or transaction pending indicators will just resolve to a flash in our UX. We don\u2019t want the full 15 second block time, that takes too long, but we do want to be able to test all the components we are developing. 2\u20133 seconds is plenty enough for this.As you can see, the Ganache CLI -b option has been called here to change the configuration directly from the Terminal. For more info on ganache-cli, observe the full command list here.Importing Your ContractsTo start using Drizzle we need smart contracts to interact with. There are two methods we can deploy to load smart contracts into our dapp:By importing your migrated contract JSON interfaces. In Truffle, running truffle migrate (the process of deploying your smart contracts from /contracts to a blockchain) will also generate an additional build/contracts/ folder with JSON interfaces of your contracts. These are the files we need to import.By adding contracts dynamically via their public address and JSON interface. Note: Provided an owner has verified their contract address on Etherscan, you can go ahead and copy JSON interfaces of said contract, theoretically allowing us to experiment with any smart contract deployed on a blockchain hosted on the platform.Utilising Method 1, we can import contracts and initialise drizzle like so, within index.js.index.js:import React, { Component } from 'react';//import drizzle dependenciesimport { Drizzle, generateStore } from \"drizzle\";import { DrizzleContext } from \"drizzle-react\";//import contractsimport SimpleStorage from './../build/contracts/SimpleStorage.json';import TutorialToken from './../build/contracts/TutorialToken.json';//define drizzle options. Include contracts here.const options = { contracts: [SimpleStorage, TutorialToken] };//initialise drizzle store with optionsconst drizzleStore = generateStore(options);//initialise drizzle object, passing options and storeconst drizzle = new Drizzle(options, drizzleStore);//include drizzle Context wrapping <App />ReactDOM.render( <DrizzleContext.Provider drizzle={drizzle}>    <App /> </DrizzleContext.Provider>,document.getElementById('root'));Drizzle is now initialised at the top layer of your dapp, whereby every component will now have access to Drizzle\u2019s Context object.Now let\u2019s take a step down into <App />. What the Drizzle Context Provider gives us are 3 objects; namely drizzle, drizzleStore and initialised, thus giving us access to drizzle functionality, drizzle state and whether drizzle is ready to go respectively. \u201cReady to go\u201d here meaning drizzle is initialised and connected to a web3 provider.Let\u2019s see what accessing these objects looks like within <App />.App.js:import { MyDrizzleApp } from './MyDrizzleApp';import { DrizzleContext } from \"drizzle-react\";export const App = () => (//DrizzleContext Consumer gives us access to our drizzle objects.<DrizzleContext.Consumer>    {drizzleContext => {      const { drizzle,               drizzleState,               initialized } = drizzleContext;     //return a loading UI if drizzle is not yet initialised     if(!initialized){        return \"Loading...\";      }            //pass drizzle down as props into a subcomponent      <MyDrizzleApp          drizzle={drizzle}          drizzleState={drizzleState} />  }}  </DrizzleContext.Consumer>)export default App;Notice how drizzleStore has now changed to drizzleState inside the Context Consumer.The above demonstrates how we can access drizzle from <DrizzleContext.Consumer>. A loading UI is returned in the event drizzle has not yet initialised.It is most likely the case that your dapp will not be functional without drizzle initialised, therefore I recommend a fullscreen pre-loader with placeholder shadow animations where necessary.Note: This <MyDrizzleApp /> example was taken from the official Drizzle documentation. It is amusing how the drizzle Context allows access to drizzle anywhere inside the component tree, the first usage example of which immediately resorts to props. But this at least does highlight our options for passing drizzle around components.Let\u2019s finally retrieve the drizzle props within <MyDrizzleApp />:MyDrizzleApp.js:import React from \"react\";export default class MyDrizzleApp extends React.Component {   componentDidMount() {    //access drizzle props within componentDidMount    const { drizzle, drizzleState } = this.props; }render() {    return (      <div>...</div>    );  }}componentDidMount is a preferred method to call contracts and prepare component data derived from web3. Now we have drizzle and drizzleState at hand, let\u2019s explore how to get and set data from smart contracts on the blockchain, and how to initiate transactions. This is done with 2 methods in drizzle, cacheCall() and cacheSend().Interacting with ContractscacheCall() and cacheSend() are two methods drizzle provide that not only call smart contract methods and fetch data, but also store that response data in drizzleState. Thereafter, that data is kept synchronised with the blockchain.Let\u2019s briefly look at 2 examples of these methods.cacheCall() sends contract data and stores results in stateCalling cacheCall() will call a smart contract method and store the returned data in drizzleState. A key to access this data is also provided upon resolving a cacheCall(), namely the dataKey. Let\u2019s assume drizzle is initialised within MyDrizzleApp, and call a contract method:const getStoredData = () => {   let state = drizzle.store.getState();   //1. make the call to the `storedData` method of our SimpleStorage contract. dataKey is returned.   const dataKey = drizzle.contracts.SimpleStorage.methods.storedData.cacheCall();   //2. return the resulting state value using dataKey.   return    state.contracts.SimpleStorage.methods.storedData[dataKey].value;}It is important to keep in mind that this call will continue to synchronise our data with the blockchain. If we simply want to get data without storing it in drizzleState, and therefore not synchronise it, we still have access to vanilla web3 methods and properties within drizzle:drizzle.contracts.SimpleStorage.methods.storedData().call();Where cacheCall() allows contract interaction, cacheSend() allows us to call and synchronise contract transactions. Let\u2019s look at this next.cacheSend() sends a transaction and stores results in stateCalling cacheSend() will initiate a transaction. Passing options into this method allows us to supply the standard from, gas and gasPrice of a transaction. Drizzle provides a stackId key, used to access the transaction status and other data in drizzleState.Let\u2019s look at how a transaction can be called and retrieved from state using cacheSend():const sendTransaction = () => {   let state = drizzle.store.getState();   //send 2 ETH in a transaction calling the `set` method of SimpleStorage.   const stackId = drizzle.contracts.SimpleStorage.methods.set.cacheSend(2, {from: '0x3f...'});   //using stackId, access the transaction hash and status within drizzleState.   if(state.transactionStack[stackId]){      const txHash = state.transactionStack[stackId];      return state.transactions[txHash].status;   }}Like cacheCall(), we also have access to web3 methods in the event that we do not wish this transaction to be synced to the store:drizzle.contracts.SimpleStorage.methods.set(2).send({from: '0x3f...'})Detailed documentation on contract interaction can be found here in the official Truffle docs.Having an existing Redux storeNow, you may already have a redux store initialised before introducing Drizzle to your dapp. This is no problem; Drizzle lays out detailed documentation on how to run a drizzleStore inline with your existing store, as well as how to combine the drizzleStore into your existing store. The preferred method will be dependent on your dapp requirements, but I would lean towards unifying state into one store. The full documentation on this subject can be found here.Where to take Drizzle from hereWe have now visited how to integrate Drizzle into your dapp using Context, as well as how to call contract methods and send transactions. This can be done with web3, or via drizzle\u2019s cacheCall() and cacheSend() methods, that automatically store results in state and keep data synchronised.Of course, this is not all Drizzle has to offer \u2014 read the documentation in full (starting with the overview) to familiarise yourself with Drizzle in its entirety. In particular, take note of the state structure and drizzle options to get a full picture of its capabilities.My thoughts on DrizzleDrizzle aims to solve the critical function of keeping your dapps in sync with the network (blockchain), and does so in a way whereby developers do not need to think about the inner workings of the package. Drizzle is developer friendly; it allows us to focus more on UX behaviour without worrying how to sync true data from the blockchain; this is done behind the scenes and supplied in your drizzleStore. This is a huge timesaver, trusted that Drizzle is reliable.drizzle-react-components is still in its early stages with only 3 components currently available from the package; I am confident the offering will grow once more use cases are developed and adopted into the package; time will fix this. However, the <ContractForm /> component is very useful, providing you a form on the fly to interact with your contracts . This is the main benefit of the package so far, and is great for testing in your front end.And naturally, Drizzle is a welcome addition to the Truffle suite that is able to be integrated into your project without any changes to your existing Truffle configuration. Overall Drizzle is a strong addition to the Truffle suite.", "responses": 1, "tags": ["React", "Ethereum", "Software Engineering", "Programming", "JavaScript"]}, {"title": "Ethereum \u00d0Apps Programming Distilled \u2014 Part 5", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@mbellinaso/ethereum-dapps-programming-distilled-publishing-ropsten-testnet-mainnet-infura-f5b391c80e60?source=search_post", "author_name": "Marco Bellinaso", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@mbellinaso", "publish_date": "2018-03-06", "last_modified_date": "2018-05-02", "readtime": "7.68", "claps": 55, "voters": 17, "content": "Ethereum \u00d0Apps Programming Distilled \u2014 Part 5Publishing a DApp: using Truffle to deploy on either the Ropsten testnet or on the mainnet, and deploying the frontend on GitHub Pages with CloudFront on top.Marco BellinasoFollowMar 6, 2018 \u00b7 8 min readThis is a multi-part article. Here are the links to the other parts:Part 1: What is a blockchain and how does it work?Part 2: What\u2019s special about Ethereum, and how to write a Smart Contract with Solidity?Part 3: Deploying the backend of a DApp: Geth, Mist and TrufflePart 4: Creating and deploying the frontend with HTML, JS, Web3 and MetaMaskSo far we\u2019ve worked with a local private blockchain, and a frontend running on a local webserver. Let\u2019s see what it takes to publish it \u201clive\u201d, so that it\u2019s usable by other people.BackendPublishing a Smart Contract to a public blockchain is the same regardless of whether it\u2019s a testnet (I used Ropsten) or mainnet (besides the price of course \u2014 it\u2019s free on testnet, it\u2019s not free on mainnet). The \u201cpure\u201d approach would be to use the geth client to download the entire blockchain on your machine, then deploy to it (using geth, Mist or Truffle) and have the transaction broadcasted from your machine to the closest nodes and then to the entire network. I gave it a try but, honestly, I failed: geth kept finding only 1 or 2 nodes to downloaded data from, they dropped very often, and for that reason or unknown others geth was always getting stuck indefinitely. After a Saturday of attempts I gave up and looked at alternatives.Turns out there is a very easy one, which is sending the transactions to the public nodes hosted by Infura.io rather than using a local node! Just sign up on their website for free and you\u2019ll be given the url of a node that you can use rather than using localhost. You save time and plenty of space on your hdd. Once you have that, install the truffle-hdwallet-provider library on your machine, and finally edit the truffle.js file as follows to configure the Ropsten network (see here for a full step-by-step guide):var HDWalletProvider = require(\"truffle-hdwallet-provider\");var Web3 = require(\"web3\");var web3 = new Web3();var mnemonicRopsten = \"...find these on the MetaMask popup...\";module.exports = {  networks: {   development: {      host: \"localhost\",      port: 9545,      network_id: \"*\" // Match any network id    },    ropsten: {      provider: function() {        return new HDWalletProvider(mnemonicRopsten,            \"https://ropsten.infura.io/[your token here]\")      },      network_id: 3,      gas: 4600000,      gasPrice: web3.toWei(\"20\", \"gwei\")    }     }};Now execute \u201ctruffle migrate \u2014 network ropsten\u201d from the command-line, and that will hopefully deploy your contract on the Ropsten testnet, giving you a feedback similar to the following:Using network 'ropsten'.Running migration: 1_initial_migration.js  Deploying Migrations...  ... 0x6cd4f49d0c04a3d976c63d04c766ba50f9813a5cd72265e4a4adf527d04d4791  Migrations: 0x7076dff8039206819f0c0ab7158457e8ee615ae5Saving successful migration to network...  ... 0xa8eb0ac1f5967338744a491eb74d20fbc652e49b112b30c66a48b43462ca0778Saving artifacts...Running migration: 2_deploy_contracts.js  Deploying MessageStorage...  ... 0x338eecf2260437d7aa45dc348dc8e675aea1d132ba18c94af0a2fa34bc34f766  MessageStorage: 0x765c19b73379dec5d851f66d937e053c865f9960Saving successful migration to network...  ... 0xda762551e6931e1d34e85418d3b467da4aa22501875ec3302a6d6e2aad680decSaving artifacts...The address in bold is the transaction that actually deployed the contract on the Ropsten testnet, which you can search on ropsten.etherscan.io to see all details about it. For example it\u2019s very interesting to see that the transaction costed 0.03454534 ETH\u2026which is 0 USD on the testnet, but would have been around 30$ on the mainnet, at the current valuation of 1ETH=865USD. That is for a contract of around 200 lines + 800 lines for helper libraries; the cost would of course go up according to how big your contract and dependencies are! That is one of the reasons why you\u2019ll really want to deploy when you\u2019re confident that everything is ok, there are no bugs, etc.Note: if you get \u201cout of gas\u201d errors when trying to run the migration, check from MetaMask that the first account in the Ropsten network has some Ether (HDWalletProvider uses the first one, you can\u2019t make it use a different one). If you need some, just click \u201cBuy\u201d from MetaMask and it will send you to a webpage where you can get some from a free \u201cfaucet\u201d.As said, publishing to the mainnet would follow the same approach: you\u2019d just use a different url from Infura for the truffle.js file, and you\u2019d need some real Ether in your account.FrontendRunning Truffle to deploy on the public blockchain does of course create a new ABI file (eg. ../build/contracts/MessageStorage.json), with the address of where the contract is available on that network. Just include that file in your project, by replacing the one used during development that was pointing to the private chain, and you\u2019re done. You can test the frontend on the same http://localhost:3000 url that you\u2019ve used before, to ensure everything is still ok, and then finally move it all online on an externally-reachable webserver.That only thing I had to fix was about showing a \u201cloading overlay\u201d after sending a transaction to create a message, and hiding it when that completed. Transactions sent to the private blockchain are instantaneous so I hadn\u2019t noticed I needed that. Transacting on Ropsten has instead a latency of quite a few seconds, which makes it necessary to show some feedback to the user in the meantime. This is why a real decentralised testnet is much more realistic than a completely private setup.Since my app\u2019s frontend is just static html and js files, I didn\u2019t need a hosting that supports Node.js, PHP, ASP.NET or any other server-side framework. Therefore, the free GitHub Pages is perfectly capable of hosting my frontend. The nice thing about this option (besides the price being zero) is that to publish a new version of the files you just do a git commit/push.If you deploy the contract only on the mainnet, or maybe only on the Ropsten testnet while it\u2019s in beta, you\u2019ll want to write a few lines of javascript to check that the user is on the correct network, otherwise the page wouldn\u2019t work because the contract wouldn\u2019t be found. Here\u2019s a snippet that logs the current network and displays an error if the user is not on Ropsten:web3.version.getNetwork((err, netId) => {  switch (netId) {    case '1':      console.log('This is mainnet');      break;    case '2':      console.log('This is the deprecated Morden test network.');      break;    case '3':      console.log('This is the ropsten test network.');      break;    default:      console.log('This is an unknown/private network.');  }  if (netId != '3') {    alert('You must be on the Ropsten testnet!');  }});I put CloudFlare in front of my files on GitHub Pages, as explained here very clearly by Karan Thakkar, to have free SSL, url rewrites (eg: remove www. from www.msgblocks.com/something), CDN caching and html/css/js minification (in case you don\u2019t do it as part of your build process). In order to have your own domain, just purchase it on Namecheap or from somewhere else, make it point to the CloudFlare\u2019s nameservers, let CloudFlare automatically set up the DNS records you need, and do the other few steps explained in the article above to configure redirects and https. It takes like 10 minutes to set up and it\u2019s free\u2026can\u2019t really ask for more!Your app would now be public, running on a real decentralised blockchain with a web frontend on your own domain, with a CDN (content delivery network) to speed up the page load and protected by SSL.Sounds good\u2026how do I start my app now?This is what I\u2019d do if I had to start from scratch now:Read this article about creating, deploying and debugging a Smart Contract with Truffle. You can set up the environment and follow the guide step by step in one hour or so. The sample contract is of course super simple, but it shows plenty of concepts in practice, and it\u2019s very beneficial.Install the Ganache GUI to have a nicer and easier way to see what happens on your private blockchain as you keep doing sample transactions with the contract developed in #1.Read this other article, also by ConsenSys (like everything about Truffle), about creating a more complex Smart Contract but also its web-based frontend with HTML, JS, MetaMask.Do the interactive CryptoZombies course, created by Matthew Campbell and the Loom Network team. This is really an incredible tool to start from zero with Solidity, and learn how to create a game similar to the popular CryptoKitties step-by-step, with plenty of useful notes and tips along the way. Complete all the lessons and really write the code in their editor, it\u2019s very worth it!At this point you should know more than enough to start your own original idea! Enjoy!ConclusionsWhile it\u2019s no longer early days to become a cryptocurrency investor\u2026it\u2019s definitely very early days to be a blockchain developer and create something new and interesting. If you start now \u2014 and even if you only play with simple things \u2014 you\u2019ll have an advantage in the future when the technology becomes more mature and there will be frameworks and tools that abstract complexities and provide workarounds for the current constraints, because you\u2019ll have a better understanding of how things work behind the scenes.Starting out is not difficult, and it\u2019s something that\u2019s probably quite different from everything that you\u2019ve worked on so far, which should make it fun and interesting\u2026so why not?Other ResourcesIn addition to all the resources and articles linked above, here are some more resources that I suggest to check out:How does Ethereum work, anyway? by Preethi Kasireddy, gives a deeper and more visual overview of many concepts of how this blockchain works under the hood.Ethereum Smart Contract Development Best Practices: the title says it all.ETH Guide by chris dannen provides plenty of links to tools, articles and various other resources, grouped by category.Token Economy is a weekly newsletter written by Stefano Bernardi and Yannick Roux that covers more the financial side of things (new projects, market analysis, rumours, technology improvements in the different blockchains, \u2026), but it\u2019s a great resource to see what\u2019s happening in the crypto world as a whole. There\u2019s even too much to follow unless this becomes your priority, but the good thing is that for every article they link they provide a summary and commentary directly in the newsletter\u2026so even reading just that might be enough to get a high-level understanding of what\u2019s new.Getting Up to Speed on Ethereum by Matt Condon: it talks about some of the things explain in this article as well, plus it gives a quick overview of many other technologies in the ecosystem, such as tokens, ETHPM, the different programming languages (even if you can care about just Solidity at the moment), DAOs, Aragon, IPFS, FileCoin, Augur, Gnosis, Golem, 0xProject, Bancor, Oraclize, BTCRelay, Open Zeppelin, ENS, \u2026 (yes, I agree, there are too many things to study! :)Who am I / what do I do? I proudly work as a Solutions Architect in the Mobile Team @ ASOS.com (iOS app | Android app), and we\u2019re always looking for strong, friendly and talented developers that want to have an impact on how tens of millions of customers shop online.

Created by the DeepMind Research Engineering team, TRFL is a collection of major algorithmic components that DeepMind has used internally for many of their successful agents, including DQN, DDPG and the Importance Weighted Actor Learner Architecture.Deep reinforcement learning agents are usually composed of a large number of components which can interact in subtle ways, making it difficult for researchers to identify flaws within the large computational graphs. The DeepMind research team has introduced an approach that uses scalable distributed implementation of the v-trace agent to address this issue. The large agent codebases have made a considerable contribution in reproducing research, but lack flexibility for modification. Hence, a complementary approach is needed to provide reliable, well-tested implementation building blocks which can be used for various RL agents.The TRFL library contains functions that can implement both advanced techniques and classical RL algorithms. TRFL also provides uncompleted algorithms which can act as complementary implementations when building a fully-functional RL agent.As the TRFL library is still broadly used by DeepMind they will continue to maintain it and add new functionalities over time.TRFL is available on GitHub.Author: Victor Lu | Editor: Michael SarazenFollow us on Twitter @Synced_Global for daily AI newsWe know you don\u2019t want to miss any stories.

So it is no wonder he used a nickname and since \u201cshort round\u201d was already taken \u2014 why not go with \u201cData\u201d? To be honest, he was a bit more of a \u201cGadget\u201d. He even wore the trench coat. But then every analytic team knows without a doubt that all good things start with \u201cData\u201d.Reason #3 \u2014 InterpretationData needs to be translated, well not the Goonies\u2019 Data \u2014 he spoke English, mostly. But analytic teams need to be adept and sometimes creative in translating and interpreting data and information. Enter Ralph \u201cMouth\u201d, I mean Corey Feldman, actually Clarke Devereaux\u2026 seriously? I never realized how unimportant these kids names really were.Mouth was a very \u2018creative\u2019 translator. Old Spanish, modern Spanish, sheet music \u2014 he translated all of it. If you want to follow that up with \u2018poorly\u2019, you have a valid point. But you also have to admit, he got the job done.Reason #4\u2014 SegmentationNot only was Mouth the teams master translator. He also showed a knack for on the fly analysis and segmentation. When it comes data and insight, it is very important to organize and/or separate information and insights into the proper buckets.

Also, look into more in Solidity\u2019s common patterns*Today, we will learn how to build a simple smart contract on Ethereum and how to test it using Truffle framework. Our smart contract will perform basic create, read, update, delete (CRUD) operations.Table of ContentsQuick definitionsBuilding a smart contract with CRUD operationsTesting CRUD smart contract using Truffle (Part 2)Quick DefinitionsWhat is Ethereum? \u2014 Ethereum is an open source smart contract platform on which you can build decentralized applications (Dapps).What is Solidity? \u2014 Solidity is one of the most famous language to code smart contract on ethereum. It is designed for smart contract programming. It\u2019s syntactically similar to javascript.What is a smart contract? -In simple words, A smart contract is a piece of code which controls some kind of digital asset. It defines rules for transferring asset and penalties like a traditional contract. The best thing is that it automatically perform these transfers and penalties based on pre-coded conditions without a need for a middleman.Building a smart contract with CRUD operationsOur smart contract is very simple and basic in nature. It will store countries, their leaders and population.Fun Fact \u2014 \u201cAccording to the United Nations & the CIA World Fact Book, there are 195 Countries recognized by the World.\u201dIt can be optimized but the mantra is \ud83d\udc47Andy is Eng. manager at Google and works on Google chrome projectSo let\u2019s dive in.curdApp.solFor convenience I have added our CRUD Smart contract above now we will go through the code and understand different aspect of our CrudApp and basic solidity language programming.Think of a \u2018contract\u2019 as a \u2018class\u2019 in other programming languages.Pragma \u2014 It specifies which compiler version should be used. This only works after solidity version 0.4.0.Solidity Data TypesStruct \u2014 Using struct keyword you can define structures in Solidity. A structure is a user-defined data type that can be used to group items of possibly different types into a single type. Our structure will store country related properties.namecountrypopulationstruct country{ string name; string leader; uint256 population; }We are using strings to store country name and their leader\u2019s name and uint256 datatype to store the population of the country. We are storing our countries in an Array. (Where we\u2019ll perform all our CRUD operations)uint256 public totalCountries;       function CurdApp() public{       totalCountries = 0;   }We are using a variable to track the number of countries and then initializing it on the constructor with 0.Events- With the help of events, we can utilize EVM\u2019s logging facility. Use eventkeyword following the event name and parameter to define events. We have defined 3 events for the operations which modify our stored.event CountryEvent(string countryName , string leader, uint256 population);event LeaderUpdated(string countryName , string leader);event CountryDelete(string countryName);Create Operation -Now let\u2019s look at our insert function which is storing new countries.function insert( string countryName, string leader,  uint256 population) public   returns (uint256 totalCountries){     country memory newCountry = country(countryName , leader, population);        countries.push(newCountry);        totalCountries++;            emit CountryEvent (countryName, leader, population);        return totalCountries;   }This function taking 3 parameters and returning a number of total countries after completing the function.We didn\u2019t add basic checks, add them and comment your code on the response.Operations and Storage are costly on ethereum. So we are declaring a temporary struct with the use of memory keyword then we will push it on countries array which we defined above. After that, we log our event using emit keyword. That\u2019s it a simple straightforward creation of our first entry.Read operation \u2014Now we want to read what we have stored. So let\u2019s read countries data using country name. Our function simply iterates through entries and returns details if a positive match found.function getCountry(string countryName) public view returns(string name , string leader , uint256 population){        for(uint256 i =0; i< totalCountries; i++){           if(compareStrings(countries[i].name, countryName)){              return (countries[i].name , countries[i].leader , countries[i].population);           }       }       revert('country not found');   }Revert() \u2014 Ethereum operations take gas (ether) to run, so we need to optimize that. Revert function check condition and revert unused gas to the user. They should be used at the start so your function will use less gas.revert(\u2018Something bad happened\u2019);Solidity provides two more functions assert() and require(). But discussing them is out of scope for this tutorial. You can find an awesome write us about it here.View modifier- Above, we added in view modifier in function. By adding view, we simply mean that function is not modifying any state and just reading the current state. In other words, it\u2019s a read-only function.Solidity has a bunch of modifiers and you can also create your own modifiers. Here\u2019s a list of conditions for a statement to be considered as \u201cmodifying the state\u201d:State variables being written to.Events being emitted.Other contracts being created.Self-destruct being used.Ether being sent via calls.Calling functions that are not marked view or pure.Low-level calls being used.An inline assembly containing certain opcodes being usedUpdate operation -Now let\u2019s update our countries data. For example, we want to change Trump with Hilary \ud83d\ude1c.function updateLeader(string countryName, string newLeader) public returns (bool success){       //This has a problem we need loop       for(uint256 i =0; i< totalCountries; i++){           if(compareStrings(countries[i].name ,countryName)){              countries[i].leader = newLeader;              emit LeaderUpdated(countryName, newLeader);              return true;           }       }       return false;   }It\u2019s taking 2 parameters and running a loop to find the country in our countries array. If there is a positive match, It replaces the leader with your input leader.Same way, you can create an updatePopulation function and comments on the response.Delete Operation \u2014Now let\u2019s look at delete operation. In our delete we are removing the country which user wants and replacing it with last entry in our countries array.function deleteCountry(string countryName) public returns(bool success){        require(totalCountries > 0);        for(uint256 i =0; i< totalCountries; i++){           if(compareStrings(countries[i].name , countryName)){              countries[i] = countries[totalCountries-1];               delete countries[totalCountries-1];               totalCountries--;               countries.length--;              //emit event              emit CountryDelete(countryName);              return true;           }       }       return false;   }Other functions-We have created some other functions too. One of comparing the string and other for giving the length of our array.function compareStrings (string a, string b)  internal pure returns (bool){       return keccak256(a) == keccak256(b);   }        function getTotalCountries() public view returns (uint256 length){      return countries.length;   }If you followed till now, let do some google search too. Respond in comments why we used keccak256() while comparing two strings?In next part we will test out CRUD smart contract with help of truffle framework.Notes & suggestions -Smart contract controls assets, so they should be designed carefully and should follow a minimalistic approach. They should be properly audited in a production scenario for controlling assets. Smart contracts are the trust central of a decentralized app and the autonomous part of the system.Blockchains are not just a database. Blockchain maintains a global state. Every change has to reflect on every node participating in the network, so changes are costly.In the above tutorial, we used basic CRUD operation. Our crud design has few weak points, optimize it and let us know in the comment section. Operations are costly on Ethereum and you should minimize them while coding a smart contract.On To Part 2\u2026Building A Web Or Mobile App?Crowdbotics is the fastest way to build, launch and scale an application.Developer?

GoalsJunior fall has allowed me to dream again, perhaps at the expense of more concrete accomplishments. I\u2019ve come to realize that you can either transmit or you can receive, but you can\u2019t do both at the same time.In stark contrast to scheduling every second of my life, I\u2019ve finally scaled back my tendency to overcommit. Instead I\u2019ve reintroduced forgotten pleasures \u2014 like reading for fun, napping, and watching arthouse psychological thrillers when I\u2019m feeling avant-garde.Cue total anarchy, right? But actually, it\u2019s been really nice.I needed the time and space to decompress. I\u2019ve learned that being kind to myself is a lifelong process, one that I\u2019m continually refining. Spending one semester collecting my thoughts and figuring out what I want in life has been far more valuable than spending a fifth consecutive semester spreading myself thin among five different clubs.Although I haven\u2019t written down my New Year\u2019s resolutions yet, I\u2019m really looking forward to 2017. The natural balance of the universe needs to be restored, and this year I have a feeling that the stars will realign.2. Old friendsA huge shout-out to Claudia and Sam for keeping me sane this semester. Whether or not you\u2019re reading this, both of you are rock stars.Same to Ian, Jazmine, Hope, Chelsea, Ethan, Vanessa, Ryan, Darius, Francesca, Kasandra, Chase, Promit, Federico, and everyone else that I love / text / have seen with some consistency throughout all the tiny triumphs, trials, and tribulations of junior fall.My happiest moments this semester were never spent alone, and I have you guys to thank for that.Some highlights include:Twirling around Haunted Hall in Annenberg on Halloween with Harley Quinn and Beyonc\u00e9Sharing a plate of delicious homemade Spanish frittatas (made with lots of love) at 3 AM in Adams dining hallEmbarking on an all-night, self-guided walking tour across Boston to seek out cheap thrillsCutting the line to kill VR zombies at Harvard Business School via Oculus Rift (making a ton of enemies in the process, but totally #worthit)Belting the lyrics to \u201cCloser\u201d at max lung capacity while Halsey performed live at the Forbes music festivalShopping for perfumes on Newbury Street, only to discover the most exquisite olfactory facsimile of red roses known to mankindEnjoying the schmanciest late-night meal (cocktails, smothered shrimp, bone marrow hors d\u2019oeuvres & the best damn truffle fries in the entire world) at an underground speakeasy in ManhattanFrequenting all-night raves at the MFA, gallivanting dangerously between indie dance mobs and million dollar Warhol printsDeciding that a freezing spontaneous photoshoot on a rooftop next to the Empire State building sounded like great fun, despite only wearing a thin white silk blousePlaying the violin in Harvard Square, only to get chased out of the public commons by a homeless person for infringing on his territory\u2026and other PG-13 adventures.Because between endless bouts of sleepless essay-writing and marathon-emailing in Lamont caf\u00e9, it\u2019s the little things in life that keep me optimistic.3. New friendsHe was sitting next to me at the airport. He worked in finance, he said.Have you sold your soul yet? I joked.I don\u2019t know, he mused. Nobody has offered to buy it yet.How much would it be worth, hypothetically?He locked eyes with me and smirked. How much money do you have?This semester, purely by chance, I\u2019ve met and befriended a number of interesting people \u2014 including a soft-spoken venture capitalist at the Forbes Under 30 Summit, a wandering nomad-scholar from Stanford, a tech enthusiast from Harvard Business School, a German ex-McKinsey alum with a very dry sense of humor, an eccentric ex-Googler working at a Chinese startup, a JD/MBA thought leader in the AV space, and an arrogant Parisian unicorn with an inexplicable fondness for vapes.Because chance interactions are often difficult to replicate, I\u2019ve come to view a lot of my relationships as transitory, but impactful \u2014 short bursts of light against an off-white backdrop, developing into a snapshot memory that fades with time, leaving behind a trail of colorful afterimages until the next impression.Three takeaways:All relationships fundamentally require mutual respect \u2014 without it, all bets are off.People will make time for you if they really want to see you, if they\u2019re willing to help you out, or if you\u2019re offering them some sort of value.When you exchange regular interactions for exceptional conversations, you give up predictability in exchange for super vivid memories. The minute you decide to have some fun with it, the possibilities never end ;)4. MusicHere\u2019s something to think about: If your musical tastes were a blueprint for your preferred state of being, what would nirvana look like for you?Based on my Spotify playlists, I\u2019d be chilling in a lounge-cum-discoth\u00e8que, replete with all the usual trimmings: pulsating strobe lights, heartbreak, throbbing subwoofers, endless yearning, overpriced Mo\u00ebt, memory obliteration, and a svelte crowd of 20-somethings draped in surrealism and vanilla smoke.Thanks to the magic of technology, it\u2019s now possible to preserve this ambience anywhere with headphones and the click of a button. So unless I hear a well-executed-but-not-overdone EDM melody with 4/4 time signature, 120-BPM, and crooning vocal reverbs, I find it pretty hard to concentrate.Honestly, I can\u2019t imagine this semester without music. The number of times I\u2019ve listened to Drowning in Champagne by Yellow Claw, or the Dillon Francis remix of The Right Song, or the Hex Cougar remix of Sia\u2019s Cheap Thrills \u2014 (which sounded even better live, because seeing Sia perform in Boston was an absolute privilege) \u2014 can hardly be quantified.I\u2019ve also been known to fiddle around with violin covers at 1 AM in the morning, much to the consternation of the people on the floor above me, who have occasionally shouted me down through Mather\u2019s decidedly-not-soundproof concrete walls.But you know what? For four months I had music and apologized to no one.If I had to do it over again, I wouldn\u2019t change a thing.5. Cambridge UI remember seeing the markets crash after Brexit, watching stocks tumble down like that one London bridge song by Fergie, and writing (without a single trace of irony, not one) about what a bargain British yachts were on the international market.Although I\u2019m still waiting for my crumpled dollar bills to stretch into crisp 55-foot yachts, I am beyond excited to study abroad at the University of Cambridge in the spring.I\u2019ve always believed in the importance of cultivating a global worldview. Our world is so interconnected now that it\u2019s becoming a categorical imperative. Education in the 21st century is about more than how well you can write an essay, or how competently you can solve a problem set \u2014 it\u2019s about how well you can empathize with other people and other cultures, no matter how different they are from your own.This will be my third time studying abroad, after Fudan in 2012 and IULM in 2015. Beyond the appeal of globe-trotting alone, there\u2019s something addicting about living outside your bubble, if only for a short amount of time. It rewires your brain to think less provincially. It inspires you to dream bigger. It teaches you how to be versatile, to adapt to foreign situations, to think on your feet, and to solve problems you\u2019ve never encountered before. All of which, I think, are valuable life skills.More than anything, I\u2019m hoping that a semester in England will instill in me some classic English sensibilities. Like the ability to spell words with extra letters (lettours). Or an insatiable appetite for crumpets with tea (delicious). Or even a lasting appreciation for British humor (best served dry, with a side of pretentious intellectualism).Yes, I think the British and I will get along.Cheers to a new year, and God save the Queen.If you enjoyed reading this, please click the heart to recommend! \u2764For more of my writing, follow me on Twitter, Quora, or Medium.

These smart contracts resemble the usual microservices in a web application architecture, each having an API and dependencies. With growing amounts of services in distributed applications, challenges with deployment and data management become very significant. The problem is being solved by leading tool sets such as the Truffle framework, however with high amounts of overhead that might not be needed by all developers.Inspired by Ansible Playbooks, ATLANT\u2019s Ethereum Playbook is a declarative tool for comprehensive DApp automation, while remaining as minimalistic as possible. As a part of the ATLANT team\u2019s open-source effort to make Ethereum development easier, Ethereum Playbook is the first step towards simple yet flexible and powerful DApp management.Released as a command-line application, this tool is intended for ease of use and does not have a steep learning curve.Ethereum Playbook greatly simplifies working with Ethereum DApps, allowing for seamless configuration and deployment of numerous DApps without losing control over the decentralized infrastructure.The Playbook uses a simple and clean YAML syntax for creating static specifications. The flexibility of declarative configuration brings confidence into your decentralized application development lifecycle irrespective of the size of target deployment: single DApp or multiple DApp infrastructures.Ethereum Playbook is not an integral part of the ATLANT platform, rather, it is used to facilitate DApp management within the platform as an internal product. We have decided to release the first public version of the Ethereum Playbook in an attempt to spark further development, laying foundation for a new community-driven project targeting Ethereum developers worldwide.Download Ethereum Playbook:https://github.com/AtlantPlatform/ethereum-playbook/releases/latestRelease builds available for Windows, OS X and Linux.Source code is available on GitHub:https://github.com/AtlantPlatform/ethereum-playbookABOUT ATLANTATLANT is a revolutionary global real estate platform enabling tokenization of real estate ownership and P2P rentals.

Here are the links to the other parts:Part 1: What is a blockchain and how does it work?Part 2: What\u2019s special about Ethereum, and how to write a Smart Contract with Solidity?Part 4: Creating and deploying the frontend with HTML, JS, Web3 and MetaMaskPart 5: Publishing live, on either the Ropsten testnet or on the mainnetWhat is a decentralised app, and how is it composed?A decentralised app, or \u00d0App, is simply the combination of:One or more Ethereum Smart Contracts (hosted on the blockchain) that contain some executable business logic.The use of the blockchain to store any new data.An HTML frontend, hosted on a typical web server.In reality to be fully decentralised the frontend should also be hosted in a decentralised way rather than being on Azure, AWS, GitHub Pages or on any other traditional hosting\u2026and that will likely be the evolution of Ethereum, but we\u2019re not there yet. Swarm (decentralised file storage) and Whisper (decentralised messaging) are two other technologies, complementary to Ethereum, that will allow to build fully decentralised applications, but they are only in alpha at the moment, and therefore not finished/reliable/usable for anything real.Creating and deploying the backend: the traditional way and the easier wayAfter you\u2019ve written your Smart Contract in Solidity, like in the previous example, you\u2019ll want to deploy it to the blockchain and start playing with it to see if it runs and does what you want. Since deploying a contract means saving it to the blockchain, and because that consumes storage and computation, it would cost you real ETH and therefore real fiat currency if you deployed it to the live/production blockchain (called \u201cmainnet\u201d). But you certainly don\u2019t want to do that until you\u2019re sure that everything\u2019s fine and ready for prime time. Fortunately, in addition to the mainnet there are multiple testnets (Ropsten, Kovan and Rinkeby \u2014 more about their differences here): these are still real blockchains, deployed on a network of nodes, that the community agreed to support to have test environments for developers. The difficulty for mining blocks is easier, and ETH is free on them (you can mine them yourself or, better, use a \u201cfaucet\u201d like this one for Ropsten and this one for Rinkeby). Deploying here is great, because while being free it still allow the developer to work in real distributed blockchain, where there\u2019s latency etc.However\u2026before deploying to a distributed testnet there\u2019s something even simpler, which is creating your own private development blockchain, only stored on your dev machine. What you would normally do is create a dedicated folder somewhere, a special file that represents a genesis block (i.e. the first block of the chain) and run the Geth client to start mining a chain there.After you\u2019ve got a local and private blockchain you do the following:1. Compile your Smart Contract with the Solidity Compiler (solcjs), or use the browser-based Remix IDE, which gives you a fairly easy UI for compiling, running and debugging your code (but nothing fancy, don\u2019t try to compare to other real IDEs\u2026). The compilation gives you back 2 things: A) an ABI (Application Binary Interface) file\u2026which contains some json describing the classes and functions of your contract (the public interface, in fact).B) a BIN (binary) file that contains the compiled bytecode, which is what you deploy.2. Deploy the contract on the private blockchain with Geth from the command line. Alternatively you can do it more easily from a GUI thanks to the Mist Browser (which includes Geth btw, so you could have downloaded directly this). Mist is a browser for Dapps, and allows you to create and manage accounts and wallets, and use any application available on Ethereum. It allows you to upload a new contract, and even dynamically creates a UI to interact with it by calling functions to read data and send transactions to modify data. As you might have guessed it, the Smart Contract\u2019s ABI is used to discover what are the functions exposed by the contract and what inputs/outputs they have, so that a UI can be generated for them automatically. Regardless of the method you use, after deploying the contract you\u2019ll receive the address of where the contract has been deployed, which you later use to invoke it from the frontend part of the dapp (see next section).Image taken from this article by Pete Humiston, which explains how to install, configure and run Geth and Mist step by step, and use them to deploy a contract.If all the above sounds like fun, go ahead, do it and have fun. But because I\u2019m lazy, and because there are nice people building tools and helpers for lazy people like me, I\u2019ve instead used the Truffle Suite for my app. Truffle is described as \u201cYour Ethereum Swiss army knife. Truffle is the most popular development framework for Ethereum with a mission to make your life a whole lot easier.\u201d and at least at the moment they are right.

Then move your Smart Contrat\u2019s .sol files (if you\u2019ve written them already) into the \u201ccontracts\u201d subfolder, and add a reference to them into the \u201cmigrations\u201d folder (I\u2019m skipping a few details here, but refer to their tutorial for the full thing.)Run \u201ctruffle compile\u201d to compile the project.Run \u201ctruffle develop\u201d to launch a \u201cdevelopment console\u201d. This command also uses Ganache (another tool included in the Truffle suite) to automatically create a private dev blockchain and 10 accounts (public/private keys) to use in your tests.From the console run \u201cmigrate\u201d. Done, your contract is now deployed to your private blockchain. All in a few minutes, not bad! If you modify the contract\u2019s code, simply run \u201cmigrate \u2014 reset\u201d to recompile and then immediately redeploy it.From the console you can also write javascript to interact with the deployed contract. Say that you\u2019ve deployed a contract called SimpleStorage, with a function called setValue that takes in input a string and stores it as part of its state\u2026here is how you\u2019d invoke it from the console:SimpleStorage.deployed().then(  function(instance){return instance.setValue(\"hello\");});See the next section about the frontend for a more complete example that uses the actual MessageStorage Smart Contract presented before.What happens if you need to fix/update a contract and redeploy it?This is a very important point indeed! Redeploying the contract means creating a new version of it on the blockchain, on a new address and with a new state. This means that once you deploy a Smart Contract you can no longer fix/change it\u2026it will be immutable\u2026you can only have a completely new one, separate from the previous, it\u2019s not an actual fix/upgrade. So you better debug and fix all bugs before doing so!What if you fail at that, or if you anyway need to add things and evolve the functionalities? There isn\u2019t a unique answer for all scenarios, but there are things you can do: for example in my app, should I need to deploy a new version of the contract, I would retrieve past messages from v1 of the contract, and save/load new messages from v2. Bigger apps that are composed by multiple contracts might use a smart contract as a \u201cgateway/proxy\u201d for functionalities implemented by other separate contracts \u2014 this proxy could have functions (only usable by the owners) to change the address of the sub-contracts it points to. So if proxyContract uses storeContractV1 deployed at 0x123, and you need to fix storeContract, you might call a function like proxyContract.setStoreContract(address_for_storeContractV2) that changes the address of storeContract in a variable held by proxyContract. Of course in order to be able to do this 1) the public interface of storeContract must be the same between v1 and v2, and 2) you must appropriately structure the code (and create the setStoreContract() function) before the initial release. This article by Jack Tanner explains this and other approaches with more details.NOTE: if you wanted to make sure previous versions of your contracts are no longer accessible, you\u2019d need to implement a function (call it \u201ckill\u201d or something similar, and make sure it has the onlyOwner modifier defined by the Ownable contract!) that calls selfdestruct as shown in the official docs.Next part: Part 4: Creating and deploying the frontend with HTML, JS, Web3 and MetaMaskWho am I / what do I do?

This essay by Blaine Brownell and Marc Swackhamer, which appears in their book Hypernatural: Architecture\u2019s New Relationship with Nature, describes the unique process of how The Truffle came to be.image Ensamble StudioThe Truffle (La Trufa) is a study in the ritualization of metabolic processes in architecture. Designed by Ensamble Studio, the Truffle is a small beach house on the Atlantic coastline in northwest Spain. The architects conceived the structure as an inhabitable stone that emerges from the ground, and developed a carefully choreographed sequence of construction procedures that are as compelling as the end result.The architects first dug a hole in the raw earth, piling excess dirt around the perimeter. After pouring a concrete slab, they stacked hay bales to create a compressible organic formwork in the center of the slab. The architects then poured successive layers of concrete in the interstitial spaces between earth and hay, piling up more dirt and hay bales until reaching the top, which they covered with a final layer of concrete. Once the concrete cured, the architects removed the earth and carved out apertures using stonecutting machines.At this stage Ensamble Studio employed a young calf named Paulina to eat the compressed hay occupying the interior of the Truffle. After one year Paulina digested the entire 1,700 cubic feet (50 cu. m) of hay, finally revealing the inhabitable interior of the Truffle \u2014 and growing into a full-sized cow weighing over 600 pounds (300 kilograms) in the process. Thus, not only did Paulina ingest all the building\u2019s internal formwork \u2014 the formwork was also transformed into an adult cow, insofar as she metabolized this excess building material in order to grow to a mature size. The residue, or the material uncovered from the earth and not devoured by Paulina, is now the architecture.The patient, ceremonial nature of the Truffle\u2019s construction\u2014and in particular the animal-based digestive process\u2014represents a significant and highly unexpected approach to building. Typically formwork is treated as a waste material, rather than food. In this case the intentional integration of a zoological metabolic cycle in building creates a symbiotic interchange and results in a notably improved ecological outcome over conventional methods.The Truffle, photo Roland HalbeHypernatural: Architecture\u2019s New Relationship with Nature by Blaine Brownell and Marc Swackhamer is available from:PAPress.comAmazon.comBarnes & NobleYour local bookshopBlaine Brownell is an associate professor of architecture and the director of the Master of Architecture program at the University of Minnesota and the author of numerous PAPress books, including Material Strategies and the Transmaterial series of sourcebooks.

Put simply, a blockchain is a ledger of records organized in \u2018blocks\u2019 that are linked together by cryptographic validation. It is a digital storage of consensus truth. The key is to understand that this ledger is neither stored in a centralized location nor managed by any single entity, hence its distributed-ness. The block validation system results in new transactions being added irreversibly and old transactions preserved forever for all to see, hence its transparency and resilience. Open-source software that leverage blockchain technology are called dApps.Understanding Smart Contract: Smart contracts help you exchange money, property, shares, or anything of value in a transparent, conflict-free way while avoiding the services of a middleman. The best way to describe smart contracts is to compare the technology to a vending machine. Ordinarily, you would go to a lawyer or a notary, pay them, and wait while you get the document. With smart contracts, you simply drop a bitcoin into the vending machine (i.e. ledger), and your escrow, driver\u2019s license, or whatever drops into your account. More so, smart contracts not only define the rules and penalties around an agreement in the same way that a traditional contract does, but also automatically enforce those obligations. If you are looking for a more detailed walkthrough of smart contracts please check out our blockchain courses on smart contracts.dApp is an abbreviation for Decentralized application. dApps are a new paradigm for building apps where a back end centralized server is replaced by a decentralized peer to peer network.One of the most popular dApps, cryptokitties, is a collectibles-style game built on Ethereum. When we build a game with Ethereum each game action and transaction is stored on the Ethereum blockchain.What is TomoChain?TomoChain is an innovative solution to the scalability problem with the Ethereum blockchain, and other blockchain platforms. TomoChain supports all EVM-compatible smart-contracts, which basically means that every DApp run on Ethereum can be easily ported to TomoChain.For more information about TomoChain, please refer to our website.What is Cocos Creator?Cocos Creator is a complete package of game development tools and workflow, including a game engine (based on Cocos2d-x), resource management, scene editing, game preview, and debug and publish from one project to multiple platforms.For the first time we introduced entity-component structure and data-driven workflow to the Cocos2d-x family. With JavaScript, you can script your component in no time. The editor and engine extension is also made with JavaScript so you can make games and refine your tools in a single programming language.Cocos Creator provides an innovative, and easy to use toolset such as the UI system and Animation editor. The toolset will be expanding continuously and quickly, thanks to the open editor extension system.Homepage: https://cocos2d-x.org/creatorDocs: https://docs.cocos2d-x.org/creator/manual/en/Overview \u201cTomo Lucky Box\u201d game dAppFor this tutorial, we will make a simple game dApp called \u201cTomo Lucky Box\u201d using Cocos Creator.Gameplay: We have 3 boxes to choose.

This week we are going to create a Smart Contract using sbt-ethereum!sbt-ethereum not only allows you to create Smart Contracts, but also helps you manage your web3 projects (like one would with Truffle), though sbt\u2019s rich command line tool. (it just makes your life easier as a web3 developer!)If you just stumbled upon this article, we strongly recommend you check the previous part of this series.Part 1- sbt-ethereum \u2014 A Tool for Interacting with the Ethereum Blockchain via Command LinePart 2- Interact with Smart Contracts using the Command LineBefore diving in, we need to install a few things (if you don\u2019t have them already):Install Java (version \u2265 8 )Install GitInstall Maven (Maven is dependency management for Java ecosystem; what is npm in nodejs, maven is for Java ecosystem)Once installed we are ready to dive in \ud83d\udc49In previous tutorials, we\u2019ve run sbt by executing the ./sbtw wrapper script within the eth-command-line repository. This time, we need to create our own repository.To get sbt-ethereum project\u2019s template, we will use giter8. Giter8 is a command line tool to generate files and directories from templates published on Github or any other git repository. Giter8 helps us by scaffolding projects based on a pre-defined template.Use this command to create a project repository:sbt new swaldman/solidity-seed.g8As sbt-ethereum is an interactive build tool, this command will ask a few questions:[info] Loading project definition from /Users/testuser/project[info] Set current project to testuser (in build file:/Users/testuser/)A minimal solidity project for sbt-ethereum name [my-solidity-project]: eth-timelockversion [0.0.1-SNAPSHOT]: sbt_ethereum_version [0.1.7-SNAPSHOT]: sbt_version [1.2.8]: Template applied in ./eth-timelockThis will create a new eth-timelock directory (see above, we have given eth-timelock as a project name). This is how the directory structure looks like:Now we are ready to create our first contract. Remember, create all contracts under src/main/solidity .We are going to create Timelock contract. It accepts payment of ETH when the contract is created, and only allows that ETH to be withdrawn by the creator of the contract after a specified delay.Create a Timelock.sol file under src/main/solidityTimelock.solNow let's compile our project.First, run sbt inside your eth-timelock directory:$ sbt[info] Loading settings for project eth-timelock from build.sbt ...[info] Set current project to eth-timelock (in build file:/Users/testuser/eth-timelock/)[info] Updating available solidity compiler set.[info] sbt-ethereum-0.1.7-SNAPSHOT successfully initialized (built Sun, 17 Feb 2019 21:58:11 -0800)Next run compile :sbt:eth-timelock> compile[info] Compiling 1 Solidity source to /Users/testuser/eth-timelock/target/ethereum/solidity...[info] Compiling 'Timelock.sol'.

You can see ABI get created under /target/ethereum/solidity .Now we are ready to deploy our Smart Contract. But before that, if you want to switch the network, you can like this:First, check your network with ethNodeChainIdPrint . sbt-etherum has MainNet set by default. Let\u2019s change it to Ropsten (if you want some other testnet, feel free to do so too).ethNodeChainIdOverrideSet 3Here, 3 is the Ropsten network id. Remember, you should have a bit of ETH in your account to deploy the contract.Now let\u2019s start deploying:sbt:eth-timelock> ethTransactionDeploy Timelock <TAB>Always use Tab, sbt-ethereum has very rich Tab support for command completion. When you press Tab, it will tell you what to do next.Our Smart Contract will need two parameters:days \u2014 The number of days when the owner will be able to withdraw Ether.seconds \u2014 Number of seconds when the owner will be able to withdraw Ether.We\u2019ll need the Smart Contract\u2019s compute time using days + seconds, so let\u2019s pass 0 days and 300 seconds (5 minutes):ethTransactionDeploy Timelock 0 300 <TAB>Now we need to pass the Ether amount, which will lock the contract for the given time. You can pass ETH amount using wei, gwei, szabo, finney, or ether units.Let\u2019s lock 10 wei for 5 minutes (300 seconds):ethTransactionDeploy Timelock 0 300 10 weiThis will ask you to unlock your wallet using your passphrase and then ask you to submit the transaction. It will also ask to provide an alias name for your deployed contract.Once done, it will give you deployed contract address which you can see on Etherscan. Let check the balance of the contract using:ethAddressBalance timelockHere timelock is alias name which we used while deploying our contract.Interacting with your Smart ContractNow, before 5 minutes runs out, let\u2019s mock-test our Smart Contract using ethTransactionMock. This simulates a transaction on our Ethereum Node, but does not actually execute the transaction. So let\u2019s try that:sbt:eth-timelock> ethTransactionMock timelock withdrawIf you execute this within 5 minutes of deploying the Smart Contract, you will see an error. Execute the above command after 5 minutes and you will see a success message, but it does not run the command actually.Now let\u2019s actually withdraw our 10 wei from the contract after 5 minutes using:ethTransactionInvoke timelock withdrawThis will create a transaction and withdraw the locked 10 wei. Once this command succeeds, you can check the balance of the contract again:ethAddressBalance timelockConclusionThat\u2019s it for today! Now you have another way to #buidl and deploy Smart Contracts.

We recommend you read the Cocos Creator documents to understand more about how the editor works.Open Cocos Creator -> Choose Empty Project and put your project name.Structure our project and create game componentsWe create the main scene of our game (Game Scene) and create all components like Background, Button, Layout, Label, Animation\u2026 and make sure it will be the same with your design.Drinking coffee and complete your core gameplay \u2615\ufe0f \u2615\ufe0f \u2615\ufe0f \u2615\ufe0f \u2615\ufe0fAfter a few hours, we completed the implementation of the core gameplay of our game without interacting with smart contract.Interact between Cocos Creator and smart contract using web3.jsAdd web3.js to projectDownload web3.js.min (Link)Drag & drop web3.js.min to folder assets/libs in our project (if have a dialog ask to add as plugin, remember click No)Add TomoLuckyBox.json to projectDrag & drop TomoLuckyBox.json in truffle project folder build/to folder assets in our project.Create \u2018Web3Controller.js\u2019 class to handle all interact with smart contract using web3.jsYou can check the full source code of Web3Controller.js on GitHub.Let\u2019s walk through Web3Controller.js and understand what\u2019s happening on the front-end.We will define our app variable and declare variables we will use throughout Web3Controller.jsWeb3: null, // Web3 instance which injected by MetaMaskWeb3Provider: null, // Current provider in Web3Web3ProviderName: \"metamask\", // Current provider name in Web3Contract: null, // TomoLuckyBox contract objectContractABI: cc.JsonAsset, // Ref to ABI JSON file of contract CurrentAccount: \"\", //Current player addressconst TOMOLUCKYBOX_CONTRACT_ADRESS_TESTNET = \"0x6f6591b7F61EB82BCeF137792237263a428ef83d\"; // Address of our smart contract on TomoChain TestnetWe will also add an initWeb3 function in which will initialize Web3 provider. Web3 provider allows your application to communicate with TomoChain through MetaMask or TomoWallet.initWeb3MetaMask or TomoWallet will inject web3.js into our browsers. Here, we will check if any Web3 provider already exists, then we will initAccount and initContract and then initBalance.initWeb3() {    if (isWeb3Enabled()) {      this.Web3 = new Web3();      //Request account access for modern dapp browsers      if (window.ethereum) {        this.Web3ProviderName = \"metamask\";        this.Web3Provider = window.ethereum;        this.Web3.setProvider(this.Web3Provider);        window.ethereum          .enable()          .then(accounts => {            Web3Controller.instance.initAccount();            Web3Controller.instance.initContract();          })          .catch(error => {            cc.error(error);          });      }      //Request account access for legacy dapp browsers      else if (window.web3) {        this.Web3ProviderName = \"tomowallet\";        this.Web3Provider = window.web3.currentProvider;        this.Web3.setProvider(this.Web3Provider);        Web3Controller.instance.initAccount();        Web3Controller.instance.initContract();      }    } else {      cc.error(        \"You must enable and login into your TomoWallet or MetaMask accounts!\"      );    }  },initContractAfter compiled Truffle project in part 1, it gives us the boilerplate code to interact with the contract (TomoLuckyBox.json in folder /build). We use ABI (Application Programming Interface), a JSON representation of our contract to interact with TomoChain.We initiate our TomoLuckyBox contract by using web3.eth.Contract from web3.js.initContract() {    this.Contract = new this.Web3.eth.Contract(      this.ContractABI.json.abi,      TOMOLUCKYBOX_CONTRACT_ADRESS_TESTNET    );  },initAccountFor get current player address in provider, we will use web3.eth.getAccounts from web3.js . This async function will return an array of account in MetaMask or TomoWallet. Then we can get current account by get the first element in accounts array. After that, we call initBalance to get current TOMO balance of player and update to UI on front-end.initAccount() {    this.Web3.eth.getAccounts().then(accounts => {      if (accounts.length > 0) {        Web3Controller.instance.CurrentAccount = accounts[0].toLowerCase();        HUDController.instance.updateAccountText(          Web3Controller.instance.CurrentAccount        );        Web3Controller.instance.initBalance();      } else        cc.error(          \"You must enable and login into your TomoWallet or MetaMask accounts!\"        );    });  }initBalanceGet balance of player is very easy, web3.js provide us a simple function web3.eth.getBalance After have that value, we will update UI on front-end to show that value.initBalance() {    this.Web3.eth.getBalance(      Web3Controller.instance.CurrentAccount,      (err, balance) => {        if (err) {          cc.err(err);          return;        }        HUDController.instance.updateBalanceText(          Web3Controller.instance.getTOMOFromWei(balance)        );      }    );  }Now, let\u2019s see our core function sendRequestOpenLuckyBox, in this function we will call to randomLuckyBox function in our smart contract on TomoChain.For call a function in smart contract, we need use method call in web3.js. After our smart contract random lucky box then it return result to front-end with events.Events are a crucial part of any dApps. Asynchronous and blockchain transactions take time. Events help us in tracking the status inside the dApp.We are listening to event LogRandomLuckyBoxSuccessed and passing result object to our render logic.sendRequestOpenLuckyBox() {    if (GameController.instance.selectedLuckyBoxId != 0) {      this.Contract.methods        .randomLuckyBox(GameController.instance.selectedLuckyBoxId)        .send({          from: Web3Controller.instance.CurrentAccount,          value: Web3Controller.instance.Web3.utils.toWei(            PRICE_PER_OPEN,            \"ether\"          ),          gas: 250000,          gasPrice: GAS_PRICE_DEFAULT        })        .on(\"transactionHash\", hash => {          cc.log(\"transactionHash: \", hash);        })        .on(\"receipt\", receipt => {          cc.log(\"receipt: \", receipt);          let returnValues =            receipt.events.LogRandomLuckyBoxSuccessed.returnValues;          let result = parseInt(returnValues[1]);          let amountPrize = Web3Controller.instance.getTOMOFromWei(            returnValues[3]          );          Web3Controller.instance.initBalance();          GameController.instance.unselectAllLuckyBox();          GameController.instance.showResultOpenLuckyBox(result, amountPrize);        })        .on(\"error\", error => {          cc.error(\"sendRequestOpenLuckyBox: \", error);        });    } else {      cc.error(\"sendRequestOpenLuckyBox failed!\");    }  },ConclusiondApps are a new paradigm to for building applications on the internet, and we\u2019re just scratching the surface. In the future, you will see dApps become more popular.dApps decentralize the way we interact on the internet. dApps run on decentralized networks, in our case TomoChain blockchain, but not every dApp needs to be built with a blockchain.Congratulations! You have finished our tutorial to make a game using Cocos Creator and deploy it to TomoChain. You have all the tools you need to start making more advanced dApps and now you can make your dApp live and deploy it to TomoChain, the most efficient blockchain for the token economy!Source CodeAvailable on GitHub:Client: tomoluckybox-example-cocoscreatorTruffle \u2014 Smart Contract: tomoluckybox-smartcontract", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Tomochain", "Technology", "Dapps", "Truffle", "Cocoscreator"]}, {"title": "", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@_AuntieToughLove_/i-love-toffee-do-you-remember-skor-bars-those-were-a-favorite-of-mine-1d2969eba693?source=search_post", "author_name": "Charlotte Franklin", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@_AuntieToughLove_", "publish_date": "2018-03-07", "last_modified_date": "2018-03-08", "readtime": "0.30", "claps": 41, "voters": 3, "content": "\u2026wn from the previous week\u2019s chocolate covered peanuts, whose peanuts at least contain some protein.

This meant sites couldn\u2019t just store a copy of your profile data but query it live from Facebook. This was a policy to enforce though, not something you could protect in the code. On LinkedIn if you changed your profile\u200a\u2014\u200amaybe added a detail or removed a position, you could argue that a user would expect the same to happen for sites they shared their LinkedIn profile with.

A safe, protected, professional, legal, and medically supervised center that uses psilocybin that comes from truffles to develop human potential in all its dimensions and senses. Yesterday the experience ended. I am going to transform this post into a kind of report that explains everything experimented. Because for me it was an experiment, as well as a life lesson. What I didn\u2019t know is that it was going to be so profound.The psilocybin retreatThe place is located in Zandvoort, 40 minutes from Amsterdam, in what was an old reformed church. You can see more about the location here. The retreat consisted of three days, the first day on arrival was for acclimatization, the second the day of the psilocybin ceremony and the third integration and farewell. In the video that I recorded about the experience, I explain the events in chronological order.The facilitatorsUndoubtedly the most outstanding, a super-trained group of professionals who act as guides, companions, and trainers from when you arrive until after you have left, from Natasja and Dan to Martijn, the cook or the group of doctors who watch over the welfare of the participants. You can know more about all of them here, although not all of them appear.The group of participantsWe were 16 previously selected people, and I shared the experience with some of my friends. Some people came from Russia, from the United States, Belgium, Germany, others who even repeated for the second time. It was a very homogeneous and varied group, starting from the age of 30 up until the age of 50.What is the withdrawal of psilocybin Synthesis retreatTo sum up, it\u2019s a place that allows you to deepen and get to the root of the intentions that you bring with you, just and plainly.The intentionsLook, you may have a specific idea of why you do what you do, where you go, act as you act, think as you think or work in what you accomplish. Or it may not.This \u201cidea\u201d will vary depending on how your mind is wired, it could be presented in many different ways. There are visual people, others more thoughtful, others more analytical, others more sensitive or kinesthetic. Regardless of the type of person we are, it is essential to be clear about our intentions, especially when you participate in a sacred and transformational experience like this.As I said, a few days ago the Psilocybin experiment ended. A crucial part was the intentions, which serve to work on the personal past, curiosity, creativity, growth itself an exponential improvement.My 7 intentions and findings with psilocybinThese are the intentions that I worked on (and will work on) and the resulting findings:Lack of self-worth. Self-judgment, self-demand, excessive self-criticism. Finding \u2014 I understood why I feel that sometimes I don\u2019t deserve what I have, how to accept it and find the best way to overcome it. The key: learn to receive and eliminate my limiting beliefs.The craving for attention and my search for \u201cmore\u201d: why this insatiable appetite for more and better. Finding \u2014 mainly due to lack of care.Find what is in my deepest self. Go as deep as you could to answer the questions: what is it that pushes me so much to make me feel unstoppable? Answer: my nature, my spirit, my way of being, my essence, nothing more. What is my gift? To push myself first, and as a consequence, force others to release the unlimited potential that we possess, get me and others into doing something big, be able to go beyond continuously. Where do I need to focus radically? In me, being more gentle with myself, in the experiments I carried out, and in high performance.How could I be more \u201cme\u201d and less what I needed to be, or what I thought I needed to be? The great purpose and meaning. Finding \u2014 How? I realized that it was a mirage, it was everything, I am everything, there is nothing more to reach or search.The dissolution of ego. Finding \u2014 the problem is not that the ego appears, the problem is that I think I can dissolve it.Love and self-love; Is there anything here that I should have learned and overlooked? Finding: yes, learning to receive as much as giving, without debt, without remorse. Continue taking care of myself, more than punishing myself.Unleash my full potential, expanding, stretching and strengthening my maximum performance? Deepen as much as I can in my psyche, soul, body, and emotions to unlock everything that was blocked and sleeping. Awakening from sensations feel more, think less. Finding \u2014 I don\u2019t need more, or better or more extreme, I need to be gentler, with myself and with the environment, to enter more in connection with nature, with the earth, with the simple and the easy.I have understood that to find the result we want, and we need to choose our intentions carefully. Because its depth will determine the degree of transformation, we will experience.The 4 different types of shamanic experiencesThey explained to us that there are four different types of these experiences, they are the following:Nothing: when you sit down with yourself and nothing happens.Paint: when fractals, colors, and shapes appear.Emotional: when something emotional takes shape and ends up manifesting physically.Guide: when an entity appears as a guide.No doubt my experience was between #1, #2 and #3.Interesting questions that I have taken from the psilocybin experimentIt is what I extracted and what caught my attention in the form of questions. There are two that are extraordinary (guess which ones they are)Why do you take it personally?How would you be able to play with that event?When is the first time you felt fear, joy, joy, fullness, frustration? (whatever the feeling may be)What are you going to teach me? (referring to the situation you are living)What is the gift that would come out of all this?What is correct about what is happening that I am still not seeing?When is the last time you cried of joy? And of sadness?What is it that fear is trying to teach me?Is it the ego that is trying to control me?Where do the signs appear that you are not integrating what you have learned?Resulting psilocybin key points/takeawaysHere are some key points that I have gathered from everything that was said and I could write before, during and after the experience with psilocybin:We should feel comfortable dealing with rejection.Recreate the experience when you get home, with the music, the smell, the sensations, writing.We are and must be prepared for everything.Your crying will help another person.He is in the body, not in mind.Mantra: I\u2019m going to have self-pity. I am perfectly imperfect. My life, my effort, my result, is as it should be.The key is self-reflection.You can not get self-esteem without self-acceptance.Emotional release technique: tapping.Breathing is not enough when there are limiting beliefs.Meta-consciousness: realize that you are not understanding. If it happens, do not feel guilty, do not punish yourself, change the behavior.Cognitive integration: the journaling technique.I have learned two new mantras.What I take professionally speaking:A resolute project that I didn\u2019t know which way to focus.Two new business ideas.An action to launch a new project.Make the High-Performance project to start now.Two new collaborationsA joint project with Valentino.Reflections and conclusions from the psilocybin experimentThis video collects my testimony before, during and after the test. Including a brief interview with the Synthesis retreat cofounder, Martijn Schirp.Do you have any question about the Psilocybin retreat? Or about the experiment?

This powers the distributed nature of blockchain. In Bitcoin you sign a transaction saying you want to give Sally 4 bitcoin. Without this property, anyone could make fake transactions giving themselves all coins.TL;DR;If you go to ecrecover-example on github for the full codebase. Simply follow the instructions in the README.md and see the results in the command line.What is Signing?Signing is the act of a user A \u201csigning\u201d data that anyone can validate came from user A. This is used in transactions to check if they are real.A common question is \u201chow can you validate transactions are real?\u201d The short answer is public-key cryptography. It\u2019s an algorithm with 3 parts.Key CreationEncryption/SigningDecryption/ValidationEncryption is generally used to hide data in other data. If you encrypt a string like \u2018hello world\u2019 you get something like `dqE3gJz/+5CQHfSJwMP2nQ`. Its purpose is to hide the message \u2018hello world\u2019. Signing is used to create a different output string, but you also publicize the original message.The key creation will output two strings, a public and private key. It links them through an algorithm that has the signing and validation properties. A signature will take in a public key, private key, and message. The output will be another string that is the signature.Signature = F(public key, private key, message)Validation = F(Signature, message)Is Valid if: Validation = public keyNotice how validation does not require knowledge of the private key. This is what allows 3rd parties to validate information. If the output of the validation function is equal to the public key then the signature is real, otherwise its fake.The signature is made up of 3 variables: v, r, s. Ethereum employs Elliptic curve cryptography and those variables are simply part of the underlying math.Why Sign?Signing is a nice way to know something is being done by the correct person/contract. This means we can trust that someone is actually doing what they say they are.Instead of real world signatures, which can be faked, the digital ones can not. If you want to know user A did something, make them sign it before moving forward. Then if a dispute arrises, check the signature.Development:As a developer you want your users to sign a message. There are 3 parts to creating this feature in your respective DApp (Distributed Application).Solidity validator functionClient code to sign a messageClient code to call Solidity validatorSolidity Validator:Solidity provides a globally available method ecrecover that returns an address. If the return address is the same as the signer, then the signature is real.Solidity Verifier.solThe code above creates a Verifier contract with the recoverAddr and isSigned functions. The latter will return an address. Requiring you as a developer to validate, outside of Solidity, that the address is correct. The second method, isSigned does the check within Solidity. isSigned will return true or false if the msgHash is signed by _addr.Creating Signature:There are two ways to create a signature:Using Web3\u2019s Javascript function web3.eth.signCalling the RPC API of an Ethereum nodeIf you are using Javascript then all you have to do is requireweb3 and attach to an Ethereum node. In the code below, I am running a private Ethereum node bound tolocalhost:8545. NOTE: THIS WILL NOT WORK ON TESTRPCGenerate an Ethereum signatureThere is no built in function to convert a string to hex. So I used the function toHex to do the conversion. The users address (web3.eth.accounts[0]) and message with the 0x prefixed are passed into the web3.eth.sign function.Another way to create a signature is to call the Ethereum RPC API. With curl you should be able to make a request to an Ethereum node.Call Ethereum RPC api eth_signThe first parameter in params is the users address, and the second is the hex value of the message. Note for the RPC api to work your account must be unlocked. You will get something like the following back:0x9955af11969a2d2a7f860cb00e6a00cfa7c581f5df2dbe8ea16700b33f4b4b9b69f945012f7ea7d3febf11eb1b78e1adc2d1c14c2cf48b25000938cc1860c83e01The long signature encodes the previously mentioned v, r, s variables. To extract these values, you need to parse the signature into substrings.Parsing out r, s, and v from the signatureNOTE: v must be a decimal number, hence the second v_decimal that turns hex v into decimal v.DANGER: The resulting v_decimal must be either 27 or 28!Checking if Correct:With the validator and signing completed, all that is left is to actually check if the signature is real. There is one teeny tiny caveat. Remember when creating the signature we used the string0x + toHex(msg). Well that is not the same hash that you pass into the validator!Again, the hash to creating the signature is not the same for the validator. The reason is to protect the user from signing arbitrary payloads.The solution is to add a custom Ethereum message, and length.//FOR SIGNATURE Hex:I really did make this message//FOR VALIDATOR sha3:\\x19Ethereum Signed Message:\\n30I really did make this messageThis distinction is VERY necessary! Do not waste your time following any other steps.The last step is to somehow call your Solidity code. I am using Truffle 3 to deploy the previous smart contract. Please note the location of the Ethereum node must be declared (localhost:8545) for the contract. Otherwise it will not work as expected.Validate signature is validTruffle creates a deployed function that returns the contract instance. I create my sha3 message and pass the required variables into instance.verify.call. If the addresses returned by the last two lines are the same then the owner really did sign the message. Otherwise its a forgery that can be ignored.Conclusion:Signing data can be important for any kinds of DApp. Some obvious applications are rights management, copyright, patent ownership. Users could sign those files and anyone can validate that they did in fact make those things.

The first one was realizing that some of the most trivial operations cost tons of gas, especially those involving Arrays and Loops. My contract was full of them and costing an arm and a leg, but I realized a way to refactor the Arrays into Bit Strings and use Bit Operators for reading and writing, then ultimately storing them as Bytes to save Millions in Gas.The Contract requires a user to submit chess notation moves of a complete game of Reversi (also known as Othello). If the moves play a valid game and if the endgame board is visually symmetrical, the user receives a reward in an ERC20 Token. Essentially it substitutes traditional mining with searching the massive game tree of Reversi as a Proof-Of-Work with a reward payout based on the rarity of the symmetry (for more details check out the about page). It wouldn\u2019t do for users to submit invalid but symmetrical games, so validation needed to take place on the contract. (If you\u2019re curious how the project turned out check it out at Clovers.network)https://goo.gl/images/CFzNq7The game Reversi is pretty easy to program but has a really large game tree (estimated to be 10\u2075\u2074 possible leaf nodes). That\u2019s why it was a good challenge for game heuristic research that wanted to avoid expensive lookahead. When modeling the game one typically uses a 2 dimensional array to keep track of the state of the 8x8 board and an array of up to 60 moves (each of which might also be an array of column and row positions). First I tackled the Board Array.BoardArray to ByteBoard// EXPENSIVE !!!uint8 EMPTY = 0;uint8 BLACK = 1;uint8 WHITE = 2;uint8[8][8] boardArray;boardArray[3][3] = WHITE;boardArray[3][4] = BLACK;boardArray[4][4] = WHITE;boardArray[4][3] = BLACK;I began representing empty squares with 0, black with 1 (since black moves first) and white as 2. This allowed everything within the 8x8 boardArray to be correctly assigned to an empty 0 by default (Solidity doesn\u2019t have an undefined property, everything defaults to some variation of 0 or false). This created an array that essentially looked like this:[[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,1,2,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]Which might as well have just been a really long string but represented as a binary value or hexadecimal value:String:000000000000000000000000000210000001200000000000000000000000000000000000Binary:0b00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000010010000000000000110000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000Decimal:10625432672847758622720Hexidecimal:0x2400180000000000000Later on down the road I got frustrated with prefixing the proper number of 0s when the board was partially empty so I decided to substitute the empty 0 for an empty 3, after all 3 still fits into 2 bits (0b11)which was all the space I wanted to spare for each square on the board.String:333333333333333333333333333213333331233333333333333333333333333333333333Binary:0b11111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111110011111111111110110111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111Decimal:340282366920938456379662753540715053055Hexadecimal:0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFE7FFDBFFFFFFFFFFFFFThis new representation of the board is now so small it can fit into 128 bits, which is only 16 bytes (don\u2019t forget it\u2019s 8 bits per byte yall).// EXPENSIVE !!!// uint8 EMPTY = 0;// uint8 BLACK = 1;// uint8 WHITE = 2;// uint8[8][8] boardArray;// boardArray[3][3] = WHITE;// boardArray[3][4] = BLACK;// boardArray[4][4] = WHITE;// boardArray[4][3] = BLACK;// CHEAP !!!uint8 BLACK = 1;uint8 WHITE = 2;uint8 EMPTY = 3;bytes16 byteBoard;byteBoard = bytes16(340282366920938456379662753540715053055);Now all I had to do was figure out how to read and write to the byte string!Reading and Writing to ByteBoardFor this part of the work I\u2019m incredibly thankful to Maksym for his article on bitwise operators in Solidity. It was actually the first time I understood what bit operators were and how to use them\u2014I know I\u2019m late to the game but better late than never. After going over the idea of masking I set about creating a method for reading from my ByteBoard.Reading from ByteBoardTo read a selection of a binary string you need to first decide where that section is, create a mask of 1s, shift them over to that desired read point, and use an & operator to extract them. Finally shift them back the same amount and you\u2019ve got your value. Before building the mask I needed to find out where my desired read point was.I made a function that took column and row positions to help me determine the read point. I know that each tile consists of two bits to make up a Black tile 0x01 a White tile 0x10 or an Empty tile 0x11 so whatever my position is I\u2019ll have to double it eventually. I also know that each Row has 8 tiles so my placement would be (8 * col) + row. All of that is a description of how far from the beginning of the binary string it would be, but I need to know how far it is from the end, so I subtract that value from the total length of the 8x8 board (64 \u2014 (8*col) + row) . This would bring me to the end of my desired read location so I add back 1 place for the span of the mask and multiply by 2 for each bit:uint128 shiftAmount = posToPush(col, row);function posToPush (uint8 col, uint8 row) returns(uint128) {    return uint128( ( (64) - ( (8 * col) + row + 1) ) * 2);}Now I build a mask of two bits in length with both bits turned on (0x11). This will get moved on top of the read point of my target string in a new and otherwise empty string. The & bitwise operator will return a new string where the only bits on will be present in both previous strings. That way all of the tiles around my target will result in 0, and only the bits that were also present in my target will persist:function returnTile (bytes16 board, uint8 col, uint8 row) returns (uint8){    uint128 push = posToPush(col, row);    bytes16 mask = bytes16(3);    // 0b00000011 (mask)    mask = shiftLeft(mask, push);     // 0b00110000 (mask shifted if push was equal to 4)    bytes16 before = board & mask;     //  (board)0b01010101     // & (mask)0b00110000    // = (tile)0b00010000    bytes16 tile = shiftRight(before, push);    // 0b00000001 = 0b01 = 1 = Black Tile        return uint8(tile);     // returns 1}function shiftLeft (bytes16 a, uint128 n) returns (bytes16) {    uint128 shifted = uint128(a) * 2 ** uint128(n);    return bytes16(shifted);}function shiftRight (bytes16 a, uint128 n) returns (bytes16) {      uint128 shifted = uint128(a) / 2 ** uint128(n);      return bytes16(shifted);  }And now we know whether the tile at column X and row Y is equal to Black, White or Empty. (If you\u2019d like more info about the shifting functions check out Maksym\u2019s Article)Writing to ByteBoardIn order to write a new value to a specific point on our binary board we follow the same steps as reading, only using different bit operators. This time instead of extracting the value with a mask, we use it to clear out a space for our new tile using XOR, then write to it using OR.function turnTile (bytes16 board, uint8 color, uint8 col, uint8 row) returns (bytes16){    uint128 push = posToPush(col, row);    bytes16 mask = bytes16(3);    // 0b00000011 (mask)    mask = shiftLeft(mask, push);    // 0b00110000 (mask shifted if push was equal to 4)    board = ((board ^ mask) & board);    //   (board)0b01010101     // ^  (mask)0b00110000    // =        0b01100101    // & (board)0b01010101    // =        0b01000101    bytes16 tile = bytes16(color);    // 0b00000010 (if tile was White)        tile = shiftLeft(tile, push);    // 0b00100000 (tile shifted if push was equal to 4)    return board | tile;    //   (board)0b01000101     // | (tile) 0b00100000    // =        0b01100101 (original board was 0b01010101)}In this case we use XOR to make a copy of the board only inverted at the mask. After using AND on that copy with the original the modified mask section gets erased completely, leaving a space for the new tile. Next we use the OR operator on our shifted new tile value and return the whole board with our newly flipped tile \ud83c\udf89Conclusion95,000,000 Gas @ $566 versus 14,109,875 Gas @ $26.26We\u2019ve taken care of reducing the 8x8 array of integers to a single Bytes16 value and the same technique can be used to convert other arrays. I also had an array of column and row positions for moves in the game. I was able to convert that into a couple Bytes28 values with a modified naming convention. I\u2019ll save the details on exactly how for another day but the basics were the same. After doing both I took my contract which cost 95,000,000 gas to validate a game down to 4,109,875. Somewhere in the fluctuating cost of ETH and Gas prices that was a difference between $566.60 and $26.26. Now obviously $26.26 to validate a single game is still not ideal. One solution in the works is to use an Oracle to validate the game. Otherwise we\u2019ll have to wait for Proof of Work or adoption of Ethermint to reduce the price of gas.Until those happen we\u2019re using the Rinkeby Test network where Ether is free for anyone with a github account.

These are the features I\u2019ve found myself building over and over again, so I figured automating that process and settling on best practices might be useful.

We\u2019ll use Vue.js for the Javascript framework and Truffle to compile and deploy our Solidity contracts. The app is called Dapp Scratch Fever because the contract has a uint8 variable called temperature. You can increase and decrease the temperature and then ask the contract if it has a fever. It will return true when the temperature is over 100\u00baF and false when it is below.DISCLAIMER: I decided to use Fahrenheit for the body temperature because I think it\u2019s way better to use a big round number like \ud83d\udcaf as the threshold between health and sickness. Apologies to all those who prefer the more rational (but less exciting) metric system \ud83d\ude2c\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8Step 1\u2014Using Vue.js for an AppI like to use vue-cli for building Vue.js boilerplate apps. To do so, first install the tool then run it with your desired options and follow the prompt that follows. I\u2019ll use options for building with Webpack so that I can have all the bells and whistles that come with it.$ npm install vue-cli -g$ vue init webpack dapp-scratch-fever...$ cd dapp-scratch-fever$ npm installStep 2\u2014Using Truffle for the ContractNext we need to build a contract and compile it with Truffle. We\u2019ll begin by installing Truffle and initializing the project, then write and deploy the contract.$ npm install truffle -g...$ truffle init Then create a new contract at ./contracts/FeverContract.sol directory and open it in your favorite editor.pragma solidity ^0.4.17;contract FeverContract {  uint8 temperature;  function FeverContract() {    temperature = 98;  }  function getTemperature () public constant returns(uint8) {    return temperature;  }  function hasFever () public constant returns(bool) {    return temperature > 100;  }  function increaseTemp () public returns(uint8) {    if (temperature > 110) revert();    temperature += 1;    return temperature;  }  function decreaseTemp () public returns(uint8) {    if (temperature < 95) revert();    temperature -= 1;    return temperature;  }}Here you can see we have all the aspects of the contract described earlier, a temperature, transactional functions to increaseTemp() and to decreaseTemp() as well as constant functions to getTemperature() and check whether the contract hasFever() or not.Next add new truffle migration instructions to the migrations directory at ./migrations/2_deploy_contracts.js. These can look as follows:var FeverContract = artifacts.require(\"./FeverContract.sol\");module.exports = function(deployer, helper, accounts) {  return deployer.deploy(FeverContract)}Now we can run truffle\u2019s test network, compile and deploy the contract.$ truffle developtruffle(develop)> deployStep 3\u2014Using dapp-scratch to generate a moduleNow we\u2019re ready to generate our Javascript module from the ABI file that truffle created while compiling and deploying our contract to the local test network. First we need to install the dapp-scratch CLI, then we can run it.$ npm install dapp-scratch -g...$ dapp-scratch build FeverContractThe program will look for your ABI and then check your package.json for the necessary dependencies. Once those have been installed it will create a new directory called dapp-scratch-wrapper with your new DappScratch module inside.UPDATE: dapp-scratch has been updated so some path names in this image are different from what you\u2019ll encounterThe first thing you want to do is go back to your terminal window running your truffle test network and look for the address of the deployed FeverContract.Copy this address and add it to your new FeverContract module at ./dapp-module/FeverContract/index.js (You can also include the address with the flags -a or --Address when first running dapp-scratch buildto automate this step)Now we can import the module into our app and start using it.Step 4\u2014Building the DappIf we jump into our App.vue component we can import our module and replace the app\u2019s template with something a little more useful.<template>  <div id=\"app\">    <div id=\"temp\" v-text=\"temp\"></div>    <div @click=\"checkTemp()\" class='emoji' v-text=\"emoji\"></div>    <div>      <span class='emoji' @click=\"decreaseTemp()\">\u2744\ufe0f</span>      <span class='emoji' @click=\"increaseTemp()\">\ud83d\udd25</span>    </div>  </div></template><script>const FeverContract = require('../dapp-module/FeverContract')let feverContract = new FeverContract()feverContract.helloWorld()export default {  name: 'app',...Now we can add methods that hook up to our new template and allow us to access our contract via the module. We should also add a data state that reflects the current status of our contract.export default {  name: 'app',  data () {    return {      hasFever: false,      temp: 98    }  },  computed: {    emoji () {      return this.temp > 110 || this.temp < 95 ? '\ud83d\udc80' : (this.hasFever ? '\ud83e\udd12' : '\ud83d\ude00')    }  },  methods: {    checkTemp () {      return feverContract.hasFever().then((hasFever) => {        this.hasFever = hasFever        return feverContract.getTemperature().then((temp) => {          this.temp = temp        })      })    },    increaseTemp () {      return feverContract.increaseTemp().then((temp) => {        return this.checkTemp()      })    },    decreaseTemp () {      return feverContract.decreaseTemp().then((temp) => {        return this.checkTemp()      })    }  }}Now some styles to make it pretty:<style>body {  background-color: white;}#app {  font-family: 'Avenir', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;  -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;  text-align: center;  color: #2c3e50;  margin-top: 60px;}#temp {  position: absolute;  top: 10px;  right: 10px;  font-size:50px;}#temp:after {  content: '\u00ba';}.emoji {  font-size:120px;  cursor: pointer;}</style>And we\u2019ve got ourselves an App! Let\u2019s run npm run dev to start the development environment and try interacting with it at http://localhost:8080 \u2014 Error, right? That\u2019s cause we still need some kind of provider to interact with the blockchain \ud83d\udce1\u26d3Step 5\u2014Interacting with the DappAt this point you\u2019ve got the choice of interacting with the app via MetaMask or the Aeternity Identity Manager. I\u2019m going to go through the directions to use the Identity Manager because it\u2019s new and offers a mobile ready alternative to MetaMask (Full disclosure: I\u2019ve been consulting for their app team), but the steps are basically the same for both options:Make sure you\u2019re using http://localhost:9545 as the RPC endpointImport the truffle test account using the mnemonic phrase from earlierRaise the temp \ud83d\udd25Let\u2019s get started using the identity manager by importing the mnemonic phrase at http://identity.aepps.com. Use the \u201cRecover with Seed Phrase\u201d option and paste in the phrase generated in the command line by truffle:candy maple cake sugar pudding cream honey rich smooth crumble sweet treatAfterwards, set a personal password and you\u2019ll see your wallet with all you currently available addresses.Now you can close the wallet view and add the new app to the Home screen. Just use the development address http://localhost:8080 and name it Dapp Scratch Fever.When launched, Identity Manager will make an iframe that contains your app. This way the app can be visited on mobile devices \ud83d\udcf2Now we can finally open the app and raise the temp \ud83d\udd25Or you can cool our guy down again to a better living standard \u2744\ufe0fConclusionIn total we\u2019ve covered:Introducing the dapp-scratch Command Line Interface for generating Javascript modules for interacting with Solidity contracts.Using vue-cli for starting a Vue.js projectUsing Truffle for developing and deploying Solidity contractsUsing dapp-scratch for generating dapp modules and integrating it into an applicationUsing the Aeternity Identity Manager to interact with your dapp\u26a0\ufe0f Don\u2019t forget to check out the repo and add your own best practices for interacting with Solidity contracts from decentralized applications.

I won\u2019t elaborate on the first two recommendations as they deserve entire blog posts on their own, but in this blog post you will learn about how to setup bug bounty programs for your smart contracts.The advantage of setting up bug bounty program is that security researchers from all over the world are incentivized to have a go at hacking your smart contract for a period of time. If the smart contract is broken into, the researcher collects Ether and you learn where the vulnerability lies in your code.Another upside is that the process is able to be fully automated on the Ethereum blockchain and with the Bounty smart contract from the OpenZeppelin library, any blockchain developer is able to set up a bug bounty program within a reasonable amount of time.

Let\u2019s code up a smart contract that locks a user\u2019s ether for any amount of time in the future.$ touch contracts/LockYourEther.solAnd include the following contract:The LockYourEther contract keeps track of the User in a mapping hash function which has access to a value and releaseDate . A User is able to lockFundsUntil a date in the future when it is able to withdraw the Ether from the contract (and hope that Ether will triple in value by then).Now onto setting up the bug bounty program. This is the high level procedure:Create a bounty contract that inherits from OpenZeppelin\u2019s Bounty.sol and have a deployContract() function which has to return a new contract address every time. In our case, we will return theLockYourEther contract address.Have LockYourEther inherit from Target contract found in OpenZeppelin\u2019s Bounty.sol . Add another function to LockYourEther called checkInvariant() which checks state variables within the contract. These must betrueat all times. That is to say that you need to check if the contract state remains as intended. Example of implementations of checkIvanriant() could be: checking if the total supply of all tokens equals the number of tokens that handed out on a token crowdsale, whether the timestamp of a variable in the contract is > now and so on and so forth.Deploy the contracts to the blockchain.Set the Bounty reward.Let\u2019s create the Bounty contract:Firstly, we override theBounty contract function deployContract function with our own so as to instantiate LockYourEther version for the bounty program for us.Next, we includecheckInvariant() inLockYourEther and ensure that it derives from theTarget contract found at Bounty.sol.Here we are checking if the total Ether value from balances must match the state variable totalLockedWei . We know that if these are not equal the contract is not storing the ether or withdrawing as it should.Now for the deployment:In migrations/2_deploy_contracts.jsflesh it out with the JavaScript that lets Truffle deploy the contracts:Run the Truffle command to the desired Ethereum blockchain of your choice: kovan or ropsten which are test nets (For n00bs out there, these are examples of test nets that we can deploy and test our contracts on decentralized environments), or main net for the actual bug bounty program.Lastly, set the reward for the bounty program.Using truffle console :> LockYourEtherBounty.deployed().then(inst => {bounty = inst})> address = 0xb9f68f96cde3b895cc9f6b14b856081b41cb96f1; // your account address> bountyAddress = bounty.address> reward = 20 // reward to pay to a researcher who breaks contract> bounty.sendTransaction({ from: address, value: web3.toWei(reward, \"ether\") })> bountyValue = web3.eth.getBalance(bountyAddress).toNumber()> web3.fromWei(bountyValue, 'ether')'20'Voil\u00e1, the bug bounty program is setup.I purposely left a bug in the LockYourEther. Are you able to find it and get the bounty reward?Give it a try, I will give you a few minutes \u2026If you have found it, great! You got an eye for security breaches in smart contracts (this is a link for you). If you jumped to this section, no worries. The more exposure you get to this, the better it becomes.So let's find the bug in LockYourEther contract and collect the bounty. For this, we are going to interact with the contract.From truffle console :Set ourselves as researchers of this bug bounty program and setup the contract instance we will be hacking:> researcher = '0xa96c979aa675d8c63d03b53e1f06cfa33c65721e' // the researcher address> bounty.createTarget({ from: researcher }).then(result => targetContractAddress = result.logs[0].args.createdAddress)> LockYourEther.deployed().then(inst => abi = inst.abi)> contract = web3.eth.contract(abi)> lockedAddressInstance = contract.at(targetContractAddress)Then, interact with the target contract.> theFuture = 1537401600 // 09/20/2018 @ 12:00am (UTC)> etherToLock = 3> lockedAddressInstance.lockFundsUntil.sendTransaction(theFuture, { from: researcher, value: web3.toWei(etherToLock, \"ether\"), gas: 1000000 })Check if all is okay with the contract:> lockedAddressInstance.checkInvariant.call()trueSo far, so good. Let\u2019s send it some more Ether with the same researcher address:> etherToLock = 6> lockedAddressInstance.lockFundsUntil.sendTransaction(theFuture, { from: researcher, value: web3.toWei(etherToLock, \"ether\"), gas: 1000000 })Now calling checkingInvariant once more:> lockedAddressInstance.checkInvariant.call()falseHa! We found the bug. The contract permits users to override their data. If you pay attention to the lockFundsUntil() function , line 19, you see that we are only checking if _releadeDate > now . A user could just keep calling this function over and over and modifying its balances value. To fix this bug we would need to create another check such as require(balances[msg.sender].value == 0 so that an address is of balance 0 before locking any funds.We deserve some Ether. Let\u2019s claim the reward.> bounty.then(inst => inst.claim(targetContractAddress, { from: researcher }))> bounty.then(inst => inst.claimed())true> web3.eth.getBalance(bountyAddress).toNumber()20> bounty.then(inst => inst.withdrawPayments({ from: researcher }))> web3.eth.getBalance(bountyAddress).toNumber()0There we go.If there happened to have no researcher to breach the contract, the creator of the contract could retrieve the bounty reward as such:bounty.then(inst => inst.destroy({ from: creatorAddress }))Wrapping upWe saw here how to setup a bug bounty contract using the OpenZeppelin smart contract library. Traditionally bounty sites are non standardized, and its process is manual and can cause disputes such as who claimed first and whether the claim is legitimate. With smart contracts and the help of the OpenZeppellin library, smart contract owners can post their smart contract (target contract) as well as another contract which checks whether the contract can be hackable or not (invariant contract) with some rewards of Ether if it is hackable. Any security researchers can submit their exploit contract to prove that it can hack the contract. Once the hack is proved, the security researcher can get reward automatically. Or if no bug is found the creator can destroy the bounty contract and recover the invested reward.The code for the smart contracts can be found at: https://github.com/gustavoguimaraes/bug-bountyHope this has helped you understand more about smart contract security.Thanks for Francisco Giordano, Manuel Ar\u00e1oz and Demian Brener for reviewing this blog post before publication.", "responses": 3, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Openzeppelin", "Smart Contracts", "Truffle", "Guide"]}, {"title": "Build your first Ethereum smart contract during lunch break", "post_link": "https://medium.com/taipei-ethereum-meetup/build-your-first-ethereum-smart-contract-during-lunch-break-89b2a5a952d2?source=search_post", "author_name": "Jeff Hu", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@jj1385jeff850527", "publish_date": "2017-08-06", "last_modified_date": "2018-11-26", "readtime": "4.47", "claps": 664, "voters": 36, "content": "Build your first Ethereum smart contract during lunch breakJeff HuFollowAug 6, 2017 \u00b7 5 min readThis tutorial promised to guide you through your first smart contract in 25 minutes. Sit tight and let\u2019s begin.Lunch break plays a crucial role in the daily life of many of us, so as Blockchain and the Bitcoin, who went viral on the globe in recent years. You could nearly tell the movement of Bitcoin price, by the peculiar look gave from the person you bumped into on street. Not long ago, the emergence of Ethereum brought the preciosity of blockchain technology back to community. Each of us, you and me, now have the pen to sign off a contract.3 steps in totalGet what you needSwift guide through the codeDeploy and try it outStep 1 >>> What you needsolidity (https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/)truffle (http://truffleframework.com/)testrpc (https://github.com/ethereumjs/testrpc)# Note: If you came across difficulties in downloading these tools, please leave your words down there, so I would help you with that. :)Step 2 >>> Let\u2019s codeStory: Today, you and your friends wanna organize a lunch gathering with the other friends, but you are not sure who will attend, and who will not. You have reserved a group lunch with given price and limited seats in a nice Taiwanese restaurant, and you hope to split the cost with the attendees eventually. How could the smart contract help you?I. Create ProjectKick off your terminal and type in:mkdir lunch-contract    // This will be the root of your projectcd lunch-contracttruffle init            // Let truffle does everything for youopen the directory in your favorite editor, and you now have:- contracts/- migrations/- test/- truffle.js# Note: Luckily, we only need to play with contracts/ and migrations/ in this tutorial. You could delve in the documentation of truffle for sure.II. Launch a TestnetCool, let\u2019s run up an Ethereum test net in your computer. Please start off the other terminal in the lunch-contract/ directory, and type in:testrpcThat is astonishing, you\u2019ve launched your first test net!# Note: More excitingly, in the loggings, there are 10 accounts already registered for you, for FREE lol.III. Create the ContractCreate a new file under contracts/ directory named Lunch.sol. Inside Lunch.sol, put in the skeleton of contract:contract Lunch {    // Your code goes here later}IV. Initialize the VariablesRight below the line contract Lunch, initialize your variables as such:address public organizer;mapping (address => bool) public attendeeJoined;uint public numOfAttendee;uint public limit;uint public totalCost;<Tips>:address: A special variable type in solidity, who represents an account.public: Let everyone outside of this contract can still access this variable.mapping: A special variable type as well, which maps every given address to a Boolean value, in this case.uint: Unsigned integer that saves storage space better.V. Set up a ConstructorUnder all the initialization, please do:function Lunch() {    organizer = msg.sender;    limit = 10;    numOfAttendee = 0;    totalCost = 100;}<Tips>:msg: Every call of the method of this contract will happen along with a msg object, whose sender is the address of caller.VI. Method 1: Change the total cost:Let\u2019s insert this function under the constructor.function changeTotalCost(uint newTotalCost) public {    if (msg.sender != organizer) { return; }    totalCost = newTotalCost;}<Tips>:Method arguments: For this method, the only argument is newTotalCost as uint type.Access control: The if-statement prevents anyone, other than the organizer, to change the total cost.VII. Method 2: Attend the lunch:This is probably the most complicated part of this tutorial. How could your friend attend? Place the attend method in.function attend() public payable returns (bool) {    if (numOfAttendee >= limit) { return false; }    attendeeJoined[msg.sender] = true;    numOfAttendee++;    return true;}<Tips>:payable: Allows this contract to be transferred REAL MONEY, namely ether, which will then be stored at this contract\u2019s address. We don\u2019t practically require it here, but it serves as a demonstration.return: The type of returned value is necessary to be specified as a Boolean, in this case. Be reminded this syntax is quite different from Javascript.VIII. Method 3: How many available seats left:function getAvailable() public returns (uint) {    return limit - numOfAttendee;}VIIII. Method 4: Check attendance:function checkAttendance(address people) public returns (bool) {    return attendeeJoined[people];}X. Method 5: Split cost:function splitCost() public returns (uint) {    return totalCost / numOfAttendee;}# Note: Since both the types of totalCost and numOfAttendee are uint, the return value will then be converted to uint.XI. Kill method:function kill() {    if (msg.sender == organizer) {      suicide(organizer);    }}# Note: It is a good thing to kill or commit suicide in Solidity, in so doing that all the REAL MONEY(ether) stored at this contract, will be transferred back to the creator of this contract. Yet, in this tutorial we don\u2019t have ether transferal.Step 3>>> Deploy the contract and try outGo to migration/ and open 2_deploy_contracts.js, comment out all the lines and change it to:var Lunch = artifacts.require(\"./Lunch.sol\");module.exports = function(deployer) {  deployer.deploy(Lunch);};All the code-writings are done here! Congrats! In your console, type in:truffle consoleNow we open a window toward your Ethereum test net, anything we do here can impact the test net directly. To deploy your contract:deployYour Lunch contract is now successfully deployed on the test net. Let\u2019s get the accounts you\u2019ve created.accounts = web3.eth.accountsInstantiate a Lunch contract and assign to lunch, and then we can interact with lunch:Lunch.new().then(obj => lunch = obj)Congratulation and Bon App\u00e9tit!Incredible! You have just completed and deployed your first contract on Ethereum with a whole lot of cool methods! Why not buy yourself a decent meal first, and then we talk later?Play AroundEverything is ready now! There are some testing examples provided for you, but are not limited.(1) Check the limit of the number of attendee:lunch.limit.call()// Or lunch.limit.call().then(obj=>obj.c[0])(2) Change total cost to 500, and check it:lunch.changeTotalCost.sendTransaction(500, {from: accounts[0]})lunch.totalCost.call()// Or lunch.totalCost.call().then(obj=>obj.c[0])(3) Let two of your friends attend, accounts[1] & accounts[2]lunch.attend.sendTransaction({from:accounts[1]})lunch.attend.sendTransaction({from:accounts[2]})(4) Check the seats left, and check the attendance of accounts[1] and accounts[3]lunch.getAvailable.call()// or lunch.getAvailable.call().then(obj=>obj.c[0])lunch.checkAttendance.call(accounts[1], {from:accounts[0]})lunch.checkAttendance.call(accounts[3], {from:accounts[0]})(5) Finally, split the costslunch.splitCost.call()// Or lunch.splitCost.call().then(obj=>obj.c[0])Thanks for your time~Please feel free to leave any guidance or thought in the comment, if you like this tutorial or anything you found me wrong. :)All the codes can be found here.Please also read the great tutorial from ConsenSys, here, who enlightened me as well as granted me the chance to unashamedly write up this tutorial.

If you care about tests, you care about syntax and speed. We find a good testing framework is essential for creating quality software. Which brings us to smart contracts.Today testing smart contracts seem cumbersome and tedious. Frameworks have verbose syntax and make it hard to formulate precise expectations.And so we would like to announce waffle \u2014 a framework for testing smart contracts. It allows you to write short but expressive tests.Waffle is simpler and sweeter than Truffle.For example, it is easy to check what was the reason for a revert:It is easy to check which event was emitted and with what arguments:I hope the code above is pretty self-explanatory. Here is a more complete example with a couple of tests written for OpenSolidity ERC20 based token:Waffle is aiming to replace Truffle. It is simpler, faster and easier to learn and use. However, it only focuses on testing and not on creating applications.About WaffleWaffle tastes best with ES6.It is based on ethers.js and mocha.Ethers.js is a stable, small and robust js lib for accessing ethereum. It gained a lot of traction recently and seems to be on the way to be the standard js JSON RPC abstraction.RoadmapWe tested Waffle for a couple of months now and it works well for us.

Popular examples of this include the OpenZeppelin TimedCrowdsale contract.When testing a contract that builds on top of TimedCrowdsale you can run into the situation where the action you are testing (say, distribution of refunds) can only be tested once the Crowdsale has closed.The contract has the following function:function hasClosed() public view returns (bool) {    return now > closingTime;}This checks the value of now and compares it to the contract\u2019sclosingTime timestamp.OpenZeppelin also provide a very commonly used FinalizableCrowdsale contract which extends the TimedCrowdsale. Typically to implement this you would override the finalization function, which is invoked from the finalize function as follows:function finalize() onlyOwner public {    require(!isFinalized);    require(hasClosed());    finalization();    Finalized();    isFinalized = true;}To unit test your own finalization function you need to ensure that hasClosed() returns true. This means you need to bend time.What is time?Most programming environments have a concept of time. In Javascript, for example, you can always get the current time via const now = Date.now(). This assigns the current Unix Epoch time (the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970) to the variable now, based on the clock in the computer executing the script.In an Ethereum smart contract however, time is handled a bit differently. In the Solidity language now is actually a shorthand reference to the current block\u2019s timestamp, that is the number of seconds since the Unix Epoch that the function\u2019s transaction was recorded to the blockchain. That time therefore depends entirely on the clock in the machine mining that particular block.In general a miner is expected to have an accurate clock. If your clock is out of sync with other miners\u2019 clocks by more than about 12 seconds then you will have trouble connecting to peers. Manipulation of time by miners is something worth guarding against. Logic that depends on highly accurate timestamps is generally discouraged.The Ethereum Virtual Machine only requires that the timestamp of a block is greater than the referenced previous block\u2019s timestamp. There is a reference in the original Ethereum whitepaper to constraining timestamps to 15 minutes, but that information is out of date. The most recent documentation, the Ethereum \u2018Yellow Paper\u2019 has dropped that 15-minute limit.See Block Header Validity (section 4.4.4, equation 48) in https://github.com/ethereum/yellowpaperFor most purposes, however, if the timestamps vary by even as much as a few minutes, this does not present a major issue.Testing time.Truffle allows you to write tests of smart contracts using an adapted version of the standard mochajs unit testing framework. You can write those tests in Javascript and take advantage of all the patterns Mocha provides, such as a before block, and breaking tests down into contexts.Let\u2019s say I\u2019ve implemented my own finalization function in a contract that extends the FinalizableCrowdsale by adding an overpaymentVault, a special wallet that holds Ether people send that\u2019s over the cap set for an indivudual. We want to allow people to withdraw their overpayments once the crowdsale goes live, so we enhance the finalization function as follows:function finalization() internal {    overpaymentVault.enableRefunds();    super.finalization();}and override the standard claimRefund function:function claimRefund() public {    require(isFinalized);    if (!goalReached() && vault.deposited(msg.sender) != 0) {        vault.refund(msg.sender);    }    if (overpaymentVault.deposited(msg.sender) != 0) {        overpaymentVault.refund(msg.sender);    }}To test claimRefund we need to be able to finalize the contract. Because finalization is an internal function; we can\u2019t test it directly from our unit tests. Thus, in order to test claimRefund we need to first call finalize, and that means the crowdsale needs hasClosed() to return true.Wind the clock forward.To wind the clock forward in my tests I wrote a small helper utility I call timeTravel that literally instructs the miner to wind the clock forward by sending a evm_increaseTime instruction to the blockchain. This is not a standard EVM instruction, but is something that\u2019s been added to Ganache, which Truffle uses internally as a test blockchain.evm_increaseTime : Jump forward in time. Takes one parameter, which is the amount of time to increase in seconds. Returns the total time adjustment, in seconds.Ganache also provides another non-standard instruction, evm_mine, which simply forces a block to be mined.In combination those instructions can be sent using web3 to force the blockchain to travel forwards in time.const jsonrpc = '2.0'const id = 0const send = (method, params = []) =>  web3.currentProvider.send({ id, jsonrpc, method, params })const timeTravel = async seconds => {  await send('evm_increaseTime', [seconds])  await send('evm_mine')}module.exports = timeTravelI can use this as follows:contract('MyCrowdsale', accounts => {  const [    wallet,    overpaymentWallet,    punter  ] = accounts.slice(1)  let crowdsale  let token  let refunded  openingTime = Math.floor(new Date().getTime() / 1000)  closingTime = openingTime + SECONDS_IN_A_DAY  const rate = toWei(0.5)  const amount = toWei(1.2)  const expectedMax = amount.minus(rate.times(2))  const goal = toWei(1)  before(async () => {    token = await MintableToken.new()    crowdsale = await MyCrowdsale.new(      openingTime,      closingTime,      wallet,      overpaymentWallet,      token.address,      rate,      goal    )    await crowdsale.buyTokens(      punter, { value: amount, from: punter })    await timeTravel(SECONDS_IN_A_DAY * 2)    await crowdsale.finalize()    const balance = web3.eth.getBalance(punter)    await crowdsale.claimRefund({ from: punter })    const newBalance = web3.eth.getBalance(punter)    refunded = newBalance.minus(balance)  })  it('claimRefund refunds the overpayment', () => {    // not exact as gas costs can vary slightly    assert.isTrue(refunded.gt(0) && refunded.lt(expectedMax))  })})But you can\u2019t go back!The time-travelled tests MUST run last. Once you\u2019ve wound the clock forwards you can not wind it back again. This is problematic as you can not predict the order in which your tests will run. Tests do run in a predictable order within a single contract block but once you start breaking your tests up into multiple files, with their own contract blocks, you lose the ability to predict the order. This means your tests are likely to break in unpredictable ways.Testing time, take two.It turns out for most contracts that adjusting the clock in your blockchain is overkill. A simpler way is to extend your smart contract with a higher-order mock contract that includes a function such as:contract MockMyCrowdsale is MyCrowdsale {    function turnBackTime(uint256 secs) external {        openingTime -= secs;        closingTime -= secs;    }}Then in the above test, invoke MockMyCrowdsale.new(...) and instead of calling:await timeTravel(SECONDS_IN_A_DAY * 2)you can invoke:await crowdsale.turnBackTime(SECONDS_IN_A_DAY * 2)Now the test won\u2019t corrupt the blockchain for your other tests.After much experimentation I am yet to find an example where you actually need to manipulate the blockchain\u2019s own time in preference to just overriding the contract\u2019s own time-specific values.ConclusionBy leveraging a couple of non-standard EVM instructions provided by the Ganache Ethereum testnet within the Truffle framework it is possible to wind time forwards in order to test time-dependent logic, but this makes your tests very fragile. Instead, it\u2019s better to extend the contract you are testing with a mock-contract that supplies functions you can use to force the internal time variables to hold whatever values you need.LinksTruffle FrameworkGanacheTesting Smart Contracts with TruffleThe Ethereum Yellow PaperOpenZeppelin\u2019s Zeppelin-Solidity contracts.", "responses": 3, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Smart Contracts", "Testing", "Smart Contracts Tutorial", "Truffle"]}, {"title": "Ethereum Development On Windows", "post_link": "https://medium.com/edgefund/ethereum-development-on-windows-part-1-da260f6a6c06?source=search_post", "author_name": "Andy Watt", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@andy.watt83", "publish_date": "2018-05-02", "last_modified_date": "2019-04-12", "readtime": "8.13", "claps": 191, "voters": 27, "content": "Ethereum Development On WindowsAndy WattFollowMay 2, 2018 \u00b7 9 min readGetting to grips with developing Dapps for Ethereum was a lot of fun, but it was also fairly challenging. There seems to be an endless number of tools out there, and stitching them together into a coherent development experience is not a straightforward task.With a good amount of reading, and after following a few dead ends, I think I\u2019ve finally managed to settle on a pretty good toolbox for developing smart contracts on a Windows environment. In this series I\u2019m going to start by going through all of the steps required to configure a fresh Windows 10 install for Ethereum development. The first few posts will simply describe the tools that I\u2019ve chosen to use, and how to install and test them. Once the toolbox is installed and configured, I\u2019ll move onto describing how to use them.My hope for this series, is that prospective Ethereum developers can start here and follow my footsteps to quickly have a decent development setup, and then get straight to the fun part - developing new and cool decentralised applications!This post, and the rest of the series will assume very little prior knowledge or experience with the Ethereum specific tools that are being used. I will assume a certain amount of understanding on general blockchain concepts, and past experience in some form of programming. Knowledge of development practices like source control, testing, and debugging will also be assumed.EnvironmentI come from a background in corporate applications development with C# and Visual Studio. So it was quite a jarring change moving from Visual Studio to the relative \u2018Wild West\u2019 that Ethereum development was a year or so ago. Things have moved on significantly in recent months, but the rich (hand-holding) experience we get from Microsoft\u2019s tooling is still not quite there.That said though, it is still entirely possible to set up a \u2018professional\u2019 development environment. That is what I\u2019ll be describing in the rest of this post.RequirementsThe key features that I look for in a development environment are:A decent code editorSource controlUnit testsDebuggingThe code editor that I have settled on is Visual Studio Code. This decision was obviously influenced by my .NET background, and familiarity in Microsoft environments. But, I really do believe that VS Code is an excellent tool for this job.VS Code integrates very well with Git for source control. Git is currently the undisputed king of source control, and so is the obvious choice for this task.Unit testing any code is vitally important, but when that code controls access to valuable assets, the testing takes on even greater importance. Additionally, testing code that is written for execution on a blockchain is not quite as straightforward as it might first sound. I will elaborate more on blockchain-specific code testing in a later post. I have used the Truffle Framework to manage running the unit tests. This works well with VS Code, and comes with a number of cool features built in to make your testing-life much easier.The last aspect of the environment that I want to configure, is a method for debugging the code. When I got started with Ethereum in 2017, there was really very few options for inline debugging. Remix was (and still really is) about the best of the lot for debugging. In recent releases the Truffle suite has added some debugging support. For the time being, I am happy to use the Truffle debugging features, although this is still an area of frustration for me. I\u2019m hoping that the tools around this will mature quickly over the next few months.Install the packagesThe next few sections will go through installing and configuring the tools described above. This tutorial starts with a completely fresh Windows 10 install, and builds everything up from there.The first step is to install Chocolatey. Start by opening a PowerShell window with administrator rights (right click, \u2018run as administrator\u2019). In PowerShell, type:Set-ExecutionPolicy BypassWhen prompted, press \u2018A\u2019 to accept the elevated privileges. Chocolatey can now be installed by entering:iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))You\u2019ll need to close, and then reopen PowerShell, again, run as administrator. With that done, Chocolatey can be used to install the other tools that are required. Enter the following into PowerShell:choco install visualstudiocode -ychoco install git -ychoco install nodejs -yThis installs the IDE (VS Code) and the source control framework (Git), setting up the very basics of the dev environment. Node.js is also installed at this stage, and npm (Node Package Manager) is used to install some additional packages.You need close and re-open PowerShell again at this stage.With Node.js installed, use npm to install the truffle framework. Run the following commands in Powershell:npm install -g truffleA quick status checkAt this stage, the environment is more or less set up for some basic Ethereum dev. Easy when you know how!Check that the installs have completed correctly by checking the version of the packages. Type into PowerShell:node -vnpm -vtruffle --versionThe output should look like the image below. Note that these products are upgraded frequently, and the version numbers are unlikely to match. I\u2019d recommend trying the latest version, and if there are any issues, then revert to the versions shown below.Configure Visual Studio Code for Ethereum DevelopmentAt this stage, all of the required packages are installed, and it is possible to use notepad and command line tools to do everything required\u2026 but that\u2019s not really what I was aiming for. In this section. I\u2019ll get Visual Studio Code configured and ready for Ethereum development.We\u2019ll use one of the Truffle Framework \u2018boxes\u2019 to show that we have everything configured correctly, without having to write any code ourselves \u2014 we\u2019ll get to that later.Choose which folder you want to be the root for this project, and navigate there with PowerShell. Then execute:mkdir TruffleTest; cd TruffleTest; code .The final command in the chain is \u201cCode .\u201d, which opens an instance of Visual Studio Code in the folder from which the command is executed.Install the solidity extension for VSCode as shown (steps 1,2,3,4 shown):Then install the Material Icon Theme, following the same process as for the Solidity extension.From now on, we\u2019ll use the VS Code integrated PowerShell terminal. Open the terminal by clicking Ctrl+` or Ctrl+\u2019. (If PowerShell is not the default, see here for instructions on changing)Getting Started with TruffleThe Truffle Framework provides \u2018boxes\u2019, which are basically pre-packaged examples to get started with. These are a great way to play with the Truffle functionality, and also provide a really quick way of testing that everything is set up correctly. In the VS Code terminal, type:truffle unbox metacoinThe output from the console should look like this:The files for the Truffle MetaCoin example have been downloaded. The end result should look like this.Before we proceed, it\u2019s worth having a dig around in this code.The main application code is written in Solidity in the file \u2018MetaCoin.sol\u2019. This relies on a helper library called \u2018ConvertLib.sol\u2019. These files will be compiled and deployed to a simulated blockchain using Truffle.Truffle provides a unit testing framework, and this sample comes with a couple of test classes, in the \u2018tests\u2019 folder. Examples written in Solidity and JavaScript are provided. These will be run through the Truffle testing framework shortly.Compile the ContractsWe will compile the MetaCoin example. Simple type into the consoletruffle compileThe console output should look like this:You will notice that a \u2018build\u2019 folder has been added to the list of files, which contains the compiled json files.What we have achieved here doesn\u2019t seem very impressive. But, we have just compiled our first Dapp! Well done!Deploying the ContractsNow we need to migrate the contracts to a test network. In this case, that will be the truffle development environment, that is packaged with truffle.The \u2018develop\u2019 command enters the Truffle development console environment. This will set up a kind of dummy blockchain, that operates similarly (but not identically) to the real Ethereum blockchain, and allows us to test deployment and execution of the code without needing to interface with an actual blockchain. This is \u2018step one\u2019 of testing your code .Type into the console:truffle developto get the following output:This command has launched the truffle development environment, automatically configured with 10 accounts and keys. (More on why this matters later). For now, it suffices to say that this allows contracts to be deployed into this testing environment. Note that the addresses on your screen will differ from the above.The code has been compiled, and Truffle console is now running. To deploy the compiled contract to the Truffle environment, simply type:migrateThis will deploy the contracts to the test environment. The output should look like:Again, it\u2019s not totally obvious what has happened here \u2014 don\u2019t worry, there will be further explanation in a coming post. The code that we compiled in an earlier step has been successfully deployed to a simulated blockchain. This allows us to run the unit tests, from the \u2018test\u2019 folder.Testing the ContractsThe last thing to do at this stage is to make sure that the Truffle tests can be run. Simply type:testThe unit tests will run, and hopefully pass.To exit the truffle console, type ctrl+DAgain, that doesn\u2019t look like much, but a lot is going on behind the scenes. The Solidity code that we compiled in the first step has new been deployed to a simulated blockchain, and a set of unit tests have been run.What\u2019s NextThis tutorial has taken us from a completely fresh install of Windows 10, to an operational environment for Ethereum development. We have downloaded, compiled, deployed, and tested a Dapp.This is a good place to wrap up part one of these tutorials. In Part 2, I will complete the environment set up by covering debugging smart contracts, and integration with source control.This stuff is not particularly complicated, but I found it tricky to piece it all together. I hope that this post, and the coming series is useful to some folks out there.

Anyway, even if you don\u2019t, you still can follow the instructions step by step to complete the codelab.What is TomoChain?TomoChain is an Ethereum fork that performs significantly better. Its block time was reduced from 15s to just 2s and the transaction fee is closed to zero.And since it is an Ethereum fork, any development kit or programming language that works for Ethereum will also works for TomoChain!TomoChain is developed by Vietnam blockchain developer who is a former project lead of the famous NEM. Mainnet is expected to be live on Q4'18. Anyway, testnet is now already working and is also already opened to any developer to test their own dApp on it with no cost.Get Started: InstallationThere are two applications that we need to install through npm. The first one is Truffle, the development framework for Ethereum. We will use it to compile and deploy our smart contract to the testnet. And the second one is http-server, we will use it to create a simple http server to test our front-end website.$ npm install -g truffle http-serverAnd then let\u2019s clone tomochain-dapp-example repository to your local machine. All of the required codes are packed inside the repository.$ git clone git@github.com:nuuneoi/tomochain-dapp-example.gitInstall required npm package.$ cd tomochain-dapp-example$ npm installThat\u2019s all. Your compiler toolchain is now ready!Create a TomoChain WalletTo create a TomoChain wallet, just do the following easy steps:Browse to https://wallet.tomocoin.io/Click on + CREATE NEW WALLET button.You will now have a TomoWallet! Address will be shown on the top left area. Write it down somewhere. We will use it in many steps below.Easy, huh?Obtain Wallet\u2019s Backup KeyBackup Key is a mnemonic seed representing the private spend key. It is pretty important, without it you will not be able to spend the balance in your address. Just don\u2019t forget to write it down somewhere or your wallet may be lost forever.Browse to https://wallet.tomocoin.io/Click on three dots menu at the right top position and click at SHOW YOUR BACKUP KEY. You will see the dialog popped up like this.Copy the words on the last row and write them down somewhere. (These words are also needed to be put in our source code in the smart contract deployment step below.)Please note that this mnemonic seed has to be kept private. Don\u2019t give it to anyone or post it to the public space otherwise your might lose the entire balance to the bad guy.You could now close the wallet tab since we will not use this site anymore. We just need it to generate an address and obtain the associated backup key.Request fundFund is needed to do stuff like smart contract deployment. Don\u2019t worry, it does not cost you any buck since it is the testnet! You can simply request some fund to be transferred to your wallet in few easy steps:Browse to https://faucet.tomochain.com/Put your wallet address to the textbox and make sure you pass the captcha test and then click on REQUEST 1 TOMO button.Wait for like 5\u201310 seconds and then \u2026 tadaaaa. Your wallet should now have 1 TOMO transferred to. Let\u2019s go check it.Explore the Block ExplorerTo check to latest balance of the address, let\u2019s do it in Tomoscan a.k.a. the TomoChain block explorer!Browse to https://explorer-testnet.tomochain.com/In the search box on the top right area, enter the address and then press the enter key.The TOMO Balance should be shown as 1 TOMO like this.Tips: Don\u2019t look at the TOMO USD Balance since it may be quite depressing right now.Now your wallet has an enough balance to do the entire things in this tutorial so \u2026 let\u2019s go ahead!Compile and deploy the created smart contract to TomoChain testnetThe source code in this git repository is written in Truffle framework which is pretty handy. You can compile and do things in just one command line.Look at the source codeThis is a Solidity source code used in this tutorial. You can find it in contracts/SimpleContract.sol file.pragma solidity ^0.4.18;contract SimpleContract {    event BalanceUpdated(uint balance);    uint balance;    constructor() public {        // Set initial balance as 1000        balance = 1000;    }    function setBalance(uint newBalance) public {        // Cap balance to be between 0 to 10000 (inclusive)        require(newBalance <= 10000);        // Set new balance        balance = newBalance;        // Emit an event        emit BalanceUpdated(balance);    }    function getBalance() public view returns(uint) {        return balance;    }}This smart contract is super basic. It allows you to set the public variable balance through setBalance function and you can retrieve the balance by calling getBalance. If you are already familiar with Solidity, you should understand the whole code in no time.CompilingTo compile the source code, just type this command in the repository directory.$ truffle compileThe following result should be shown.Compiling ./contracts/Migrations.sol...Compiling ./contracts/SimpleContract.sol...Writing artifacts to ./build/contractsNow your smart contract has already been compiled. The compiled code are stored in the build directory. You can go check it out if you want to.Setting up the Deployment WalletNow it is almost ready to deploy to the testnet. Anyway, we need to specify the TomoChain wallet to deploy the smart contract first. Of course, the wallet we are going to use is the one that we created in the previous step. Here is the steps toOpen truffle.js file. Here is the content inside.'use strict'var HDWalletProvider = require(\"truffle-hdwallet-provider\");var mnemonic = '<PUT YOUR WALLET BACKUP KEY HERE>';module.exports = {  networks: {    development: {      host: \"127.0.0.1\",      port: 7545,      gas: 4000000,      network_id: \"*\"    },    tomotestnet: {      provider: function() {        return new HDWalletProvider(mnemonic, 'https://testnet.tomochain.com');      },      gas: 1000000,      network_id: 89    }  }};2. Copy the backup key obtained in the previous step and paste it as a value of mnemonic variable.var mnemonic = '<PUT YOUR WALLET BACKUP KEY HERE>';Done. Please note that the tomotestnet network will be used to deploy the smart contract we created. However, if you are familiar with Ganache, you could use the development network to do the local test as well if you want to.DeployingNow it is time to deploy the smart contract to the TomoChain testnet! You can deploy the compiled smart contract using the following command.$ truffle migrate --network tomotestnetHere is the expected result.Using network \u2018tomotestnet\u2019.Running migration: 1_initial_migration.js  Deploying Migrations...  ... 0x081825424ce179259d661e2cd508b6a3ec5d3c622275168bff3f0d8460348c3f  Migrations: 0x65730da7e39d3787723a8949bc7d41e7f0f013baSaving successful migration to network...  ... 0xd96186343a751f2365d6311d6c7c52d67a86eee04854c40806a628526b0a573aSaving artifacts...Running migration: 2_deploy_contracts.js  Deploying SimpleContract...  ... 0xe80a4bac1ebbfcdd5170d469aa3998f1ee292227b3c7fa677e108135a7feb705  SimpleContract: 0xb9cb9aa779c0ae4d6fe8a2292fc61233c5cad4beSaving successful migration to network...  ... 0x1397e27ad32783349568f65397e81f54dd3b1c36aa9405f06a804b271a23a88cSaving artifacts...Don\u2019t be surprise if those hex code are not the same as mine since they would be different for each person.It is worth noting that the long hex code are the TxHash while the short one are contract address. If you want to play around, please feel free to copy those hex code in block explorer and see the details. Anyway, I will not go over those stuffs since it is too details.Alright, although there are a lot of alien stuff printed out right now but actually the only address that we need to use in the further step is 0xb9cb9aa779c0ae4d6fe8a2292fc61233c5cad4be which is the contract address of SimpleContract we created. Please note that your contract address will be different than mine so please ignore my address and use yours instead.Go Checking the Deployment TransactionThe deployment steps are actually simply a set of transactions so we can see them on block explorer. So \u2026 let\u2019s go check them out! Just simply go to the Tomoscan page and enter your address. 4 new transactions would be shown like below.No action item on this. Just want you to make sure that your contract deployment has successfully been done on TomoChain testnet.You may already notice that how fast the deployment step above was. It used just around 20 seconds to finish or just 5 seconds for each transaction created to be confirmed. Super fast !Connect Metamask to TomoChain testnet.Metamask will be used as a provider to create a transaction and interact with smart contract on the testnet. (As I already mentioned above, everything that works with Ethereum will also work with TomoChain).However, TomoChain is not natively supported on Metamask. We need to manually define the custom rpc server for TomoChain testnet. Here is the steps to do:Install Metamask for Chrome2. Click on the Metamask icon on address bar. Click on the top left menu and choose Custom RPC3. Type https://testnet.tomochain.com in the RPC textbox and then click Save4. Click on Restore from seed phrase and put the mnemonic from above step to the Wallet Seed text area. Also don\u2019t forget to set the password to protect the wallet from people who share the computer with you.5. You should now be good. The wallet supposes to be shown correctly in both address and balance.Please note that the unit of the wallet here is TOMO but since Metamask does not know TOMO so it just shows as ETH as you can see above.Congratulations! Metamask is now ready to interact with TomoChain testnet!Create a Front-End Website Interacting with the Smart ContractSimple demo website used to interact with the deployed smart contract has also come along with tomochain-dapp-example repository. You can find it in web directory. The only file you need to work with is index.html. The web is almost ready to run but still need some modification. Please do the following steps.Find the abi json value from build/contracts/SimpleContract.json, copy it and replace the abi value in index.html with that json array, for example,.var abi = [    {      \"inputs\": [],      \"payable\": false,      \"stateMutability\": \"nonpayable\",      \"type\": \"constructor\"    },    {      \"anonymous\": false,      \"inputs\": [        {          \"indexed\": false,          \"name\": \"balance\",          \"type\": \"uint256\"        }      ],      \"name\": \"BalanceUpdated\",      \"type\": \"event\"    },    {      \"constant\": false,      \"inputs\": [        {          \"name\": \"newBalance\",          \"type\": \"uint256\"        }      ],      \"name\": \"setBalance\",      \"outputs\": [],      \"payable\": false,      \"stateMutability\": \"nonpayable\",      \"type\": \"function\"    },    {      \"constant\": true,      \"inputs\": [],      \"name\": \"getBalance\",      \"outputs\": [        {          \"name\": \"\",          \"type\": \"uint256\"        }      ],      \"payable\": false,      \"stateMutability\": \"view\",      \"type\": \"function\"    }  ];2. Replace the contract address with your own SimpleContract contract address, for example,var contractAddress = '0xb9cb9aa779c0ae4d6fe8a2292fc61233c5cad4be';3. Source code is now ready. Now it is time to spin up the http server by going to Terminal and type the following command.$ cd web$ http-server .The server is now launched on port 8080. You can now browse to the web created through browser at http://localhost:8080 and give a test!TestOnce opened, front-end web will immediately call getBalance() function and show the result in the above area.You can input the new balance you need and click at Set New Balance button to set the new value.And since this operation requires Metamask to create and sign a transaction for you, Metamask will be automatically launched with the predefined parameter calling to setBalance() function on the deployed smart contract. Please feel free to review those Tx parameter and then just simply click on SUBMIT button.The transaction progress will be updated in the below area. You can also view the transaction information from the TxHash row if you want to.It is worth noting that the transaction is consistency confirmed in just 4\u20135 seconds after your Tx has been created which is super fast!! (2 seconds of block time and 2-3 seconds of network latency.)Congratulations! Your first smart contract is now deployed on TomoChain testnet and you can also interact with it through simple web3.js provider on web front-end!Sorry for not going over the front-end source code because I am afraid that it would be too much. However, the source code is not so complicated, please feel free to review it yourself!AuthorTutorial created by Sittiphol Phanvilai (nuuneoi)", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Tomochain", "Solidity", "Truffle", "Smart Contract"]}, {"title": "Scaling Crypto User Experience", "post_link": "https://medium.com/hackernoon/scaling-crypto-user-experience-c7d5280eb477?source=search_post", "author_name": "Ronald Mannak", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@ronaldmannak_1825", "publish_date": "2018-09-11", "last_modified_date": "2019-05-24", "readtime": "4.43", "claps": 188, "voters": 20, "content": "Scaling Crypto User ExperienceRonald MannakFollowSep 11, 2018 \u00b7 5 min readHow many people you know have installed and set up a wallet and are using crypto on a regular basis? Depending on how you count, it seems unlikely that the current crypto users represent more than 1% of the total addressable market.A current low adoption rate might indicate the enormous growth potential of crypto. Just imagine what 10x more users \u2014which is still only 10% of the addressable market\u2014 could mean. On the other hand, there is a possibility we will never get to 10%. Promising technology has failed before, as Varun Mathur correctly states in this tweetstorm.Crypto challengesWhat is holding back a broader adoption of crypto? I see three main issues that haven\u2019t been solved yet:Scalability (How many concurrent users or transactions can the system handle?)Utility (What can I use it for?)User-Experience (How easy is it to use?)The smartest minds in the industry are currently working on scaling blockchain technology. Once scaling is solved, utility will be the next area of focus. For utility to increase, a good user-experience is imperative.In terms of where energy and money is spent on, user-experience seems to be underrepresented at the moment. Current tools and apps took us from 0 to 1%, but the next 10% users might not be willing (or able) to figure out the often confusing interfaces.Start with customer experience?Steve Jobs once said: \u201cyou\u2019ve got to start with the customer experience, and work backwards to the technology\u201d. Unfortunately, crypto doesn\u2019t have that luxury. Crypto wasn\u2019t built with a great user-experience in mind, as Connie Yang shows in her blogpost Why design is the killer app for crypto. While it\u2019s certainly possible (and necessary!) to slap better design on a technically complex system, it will be challenging.\u201cYou\u2019ve got to start with the customer experience, and work backwards to the technology.\u201dCurrent IssuesIt is encouraging to see people like Varun and Connie working on user-experience. And they\u2019re not alone, design firms like IDEO are also working on improving user experience.I believe we need more than great designers. I believe we also need developers who have experience building apps with great user-experience, like iOS and MacOS developers for example. As Microsoft Steve Ballmer famously said: \u201cDevelopers\u201d.\u201cDevelopers\u201d (20x)I am a crypto developer. I\u2019ve written smart contracts in Ethereum\u2019s Solidity language and I\u2019ve created tools to make it easier to use crypto in mobile applications. The Ethereum developer toolchain has improved substantially the last year. But especially for occasional Ethereum developers, it still lacks the polish and ease-of-use of for instance the Apple or Microsoft developer toolchain.Several other crypto developers told me they use several tools to write smart contracts. Atom for coding, Remix, a web-based tool that only works if you\u2019re online, for debugging and deploying. It works, but it\u2019s not the best experience.The Turbo Pascal EffectMS-DOS programming in the early 1980s was not unlike blockchain development in 2018: Developers used separate tools, dedicated to specific tasks: an editor, a command line compiler, a command line debugger, and a command line linker.That all changed with the introduction of Borland Turbo Pascal in 1984. The innovation was to package all the separate tools into a single Integrated Development Environment (IDE). For the first time, the whole development workflow could be covered with one single application. Turbo Pascal simplified the edit-compile-run-debug loop. (The low price of $49, and the unusually good documentation also helped)Borland sold 400,000 copies in the first 2.5 years. Especially impressive considering that the total addressable market was estimated at just 30,000. Borland created a market nobody knew existed.One unexpected side effect of the Turbo Pascal success was that the number of MS-DOS applications skyrocketed, thereby contributing to MS-DOS becoming the dominant platform.Composite: Turbo Pascal for BlockchainCrypto desperately needs its Turbo Pascal moment: a tool so powerful and easy to use, both quantity and quality of dApps will skyrocket. That way, both higher utility and better user-experience will be tackled.I have been working on an open source editor that could become the Turbo Pascal for Blockchain, called Composite. It\u2019s the easiest developer tool on the market. Since it is developed natively in Swift/Cocoa, it\u2019s also the fastest developer tool out there. It\u2019s lightning fast.1. Installing the toolchain and keeping it up-to-date is finally a breeze.2. Creating a new project is as easy as choosing a templates. You\u2019ll be able to create your own templates in future versions.3. Name your new project.4. Editing, debugging, and deploying all from one single easy-to-use application.What about blockchains that aren\u2019t Ethereum?The current pre-alpha version of Composite is Ethereum only, but Composite is designed to support more blockchains. I\u2019d love to add support for more blockchains and make it dApp development easy for every blockchain.If you are a smart contract developer and would love to use Composite on another blockchain than Ethereum, leave a comment.What is a blockchain worth without adoption or utility?A blockchain without users or usage isn\u2019t worth much. Composite makes it easy for blockchains to attract high-quality developers and have them developed useful and easy-to-use dApps. If you are developing a blockchain and would like to see support for your blockchain in Composite, email me.What\u2019s next?If you want to keep up-to-date on Composite development, join the Composite Telegram group: https://t.me/joinchat/F84Ewkd5t-RLL26-Wj7tPAIf you like to test the pre-alpha version of Composite, or are interested in adding support for your blockchain to Composite, email me.If you work at a crypto company and are interested in having Composite support your blockchain, email me.Composite is self-funded.

This is convenient, because solcjs can be easily installed with the same tools as Waffle. On the other hand it tends to be slow for bigger projects.With Waffle 2.0 you can now use blazing quick native and dockerized solc. If you don\u2019t mind a couple of additional setup steps.

Notable exceptions are the chai matchers, which we plan to include in version 2.1.FixturesWhen extensively testing code dependent on smart contracts it is often useful to have a specific scenario play out before each test. That leads to repetition and slow code execution. With fixtures, you can clean-up your code and speed it up by a order of magnitude.

One of the most popular DApps \u2014 Cryptokitties, is collectibles-style Dapp built on Ethereum. When we build a game with Ethereum, essentially, each game action and transaction is be stored on the Ethereum blockchain.What\u2019s TomoChain?In short, TomoChain is an innovative solution to blockchain scalability and functionality. TomoChain supports all EVM-compatible smart-contracts, which basically means that every DApp run on Ethereum can be easily ported to TomoChain.Every DApp running on Ethereum can be easily ported to TomoChain!Why should developers build DApps on TomoChain?TomoChain is a blockchain built for practical decentralized applications.Remember CryptoKitties in 2017? A single DApp brought the whole Ethereum blockchain to their knees. The network was congested, with endless waiting times for transaction confirmation and high transaction fees. Porting to TomoChain would seem a good idea for the cute kitties. TomoChain mainnet can process 2'000 TPS, which is 100x faster than the Ethereum blockchain, and for a fraction (1/1000) of the cost of DApps on Ethereum. Furthermore, the whole TomoChain ecosystem is also quickly evolving, which makes it become an ideal platform for DApp development.For more information about TomoChain, please refer to our website.IntroductionIn this tutorial, we will see how easy it is to migrate the TomoRPS (source code can be found here and here) game from Ethereum to TomoChain in 1 hour.The migration consists of 3 steps:Remove some configs of Ethereum network and replace by TomoChain network in Truffle project.Compile & deploy a smart contract to TomoChain networks.Update old client and testing the game :)Below is Video showing that TomoRPS was slow and had bad user experience because of the low performance of Ethereum.Remove some configs of Ethereum network and replace by TomoChain network in Truffle projectTake a look at our current truffle-config.js.We have 2 configs for deploying the smart contract to Ropsten Testnet and Ethereum Mainnet.var HDWalletProvider = require(\"truffle-hdwallet-provider\");var mnemonic = \"YOUR_MNEMONIC\";module.exports = {  // See <http://truffleframework.com/docs/advanced/configuration>  // to customize your Truffle configuration!  networks: {    solc: {      optimizer: {        enabled: true,        runs: 200      }    },    development: {      host: \"127.0.0.1\",      port: 7545,      network_id: \"*\" // Match any network id    },    ropsten: {      // must be a thunk, otherwise truffle commands may hang in CI      provider: () =>        new HDWalletProvider(          mnemonic,          \"https://ropsten.infura.io/v3/9b5040ea0b704bf18af87f7edb53a644\"        ),      network_id: \"3\",      gas: 5000000    },    mainnet: {      // must be a thunk, otherwise truffle commands may hang in CI      provider: () =>        new HDWalletProvider(          mnemonic,          \"https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/9be4a7a6a57a47eea40d6a37af2b2712\"        ),      network_id: \"1\",      gas: 5000000,      gasPrice: 10000000000    }  }};To deploy the same contract onto TomoChain, let\u2019s change the configuration to connect to the TomoChain network. Check TomoChain Network document, we can find all configs of TomoChain networks easily. The configuration change basically tells Truffle to connects to TomoChain and deploy the contract on it instead of Ethereum.Finally, we have the updated truffle-config.js.\"use strict\";var HDWalletProvider = require(\"truffle-hdwallet-provider\");var mnemonic = \"YOUR_MNEMONIC\";  module.exports = {  networks: {    development: {      provider: () => new HDWalletProvider(mnemonic, \"http://127.0.0.1:8545\"),      host: \"127.0.0.1\",      port: \"8545\",      network_id: \"*\" // Match any network id    },    tomotestnet: {      provider: () =>        new HDWalletProvider(          mnemonic,          \"https://testnet.tomochain.com\",          0,          1,          true,          \"m/44'/889'/0'/0/\"        ),      network_id: \"89\",      gas: 5000000,      gasPrice: 10000000000000    },    tomomainnet: {      provider: () =>        new HDWalletProvider(          mnemonic,          \"https://rpc.tomochain.com\",          0,          1,          true,          \"m/44'/889'/0'/0/\"        ),      network_id: \"88\",      gas: 5000000,      gasPrice: 10000000000000    }  },  compilers: {    solc: {      settings: {        evmVersion: \"byzantium\"      }    }  }};Compile & deploy a smart contract to TomoChain networksNow, it\u2019s a good time to compile the smart contract with TomoChain networks.Run command truffle compileMigrate the contract to TomoChain Testnet network:truffle migrate --network tomotestnetAfter a few seconds, the smart contract will be migrated successfully to TomoChain Testnet.Update client to interact with TomoChain smart contractThis is the easiest step. We only need to change old smart contract address to new address on TomoChain and update our client (text, icon, logon\u2026) to match with TomoChain.ADDRESS_CONTRACT: \u201c0xb7cEb47FbD0f6f98E16E681eb3933B7801a1ce43\u201dYou can go to TomoScan Testnet to verify the contract deployment.TestingLet\u2019s get some faucet TOMO from the faucet page.Connect MetaMask to TomoChain Testnet by following this guide.You can even play the game with TomoWallet through our built-in DApp Browser, which provides the best user experience for gamers.And enjoy the game running on TomoChain and taste how fast and cheap transactions on TomoChain are.Below is the video showing how fast TomoRPS is on TomoChain.ConclusionIt will not be too difficult and won\u2019t take much time to migrate your DApps from Ethereum to TomoChain. Along with that DApps running on TomoChain has many advantages in speed and cost. So don\u2019t hesitate to bring your DApps to TomoChain where you can make your DApps great again\u2026 \ud83d\ude0eGithub: https://github.com/tomochain/docs/blob/game_tutorials/docs/developers/migrate_from_ethereum.mdAbout TomoChainTomoChain blockchain and product ecosystem allow entrepreneurs, enterprises, and institutions to build high-performance, feature-rich blockchain projects on an enhanced EVM-compatible platform.

Harpenden AirFlying time poor families to the alps in private jets with family friendly schedules for weekend skiing.Status: Evaluating DesirabilityIt appears, that crazy, stupid unreal thought that was just wasting space in my brain is actually an idea that has merit. I wouldn\u2019t have know that unless I had shared my fledgling idea.Article on the front page of the Financial TimesLast weekend, at a Sunday lunch in Redbourne I posted a message to the Harpenden Parents Network to find out if anyone would be interested in sharing a private jet to the alps. My hypothesis was that 80% of the comments would be tolls and banter with 20% of genuine interest. That hypothesis held true.What happens next shows the power of sharing your ideas. I was contacted by a journalist at the Financial Times who lives locally and who was interested in running a story on the sharing economy. It turns out, that I am not the only one who sees peak prices during school holidays like February half term to the alps as an issue. My stupid idea to share a private jet, it turns out is actually far more sensible than it first appears.The question is now what the next step is on my journey to start a skiing airline aimed at time poor families with a passion for snow sports.I\u2019m hoping that by the end of the weekend I will have a website for Harpenden Air and can start collecting genuine customer interest. (If you\u2019re interested just message me on LinkedIn)Stupid Idea 2. MisterTruffleSelling fresh truffles to foodies by the gram on the internet.Status: SOLD.This isn\u2019t the first time sharing a stupid idea has lead to an exciting journey for me. Back in 2008 I started a company selling fresh truffles to foodies by the gram. The first step on that journey was a Facebook post, asking people if it was a good idea. My hypothesis was that people would either not respond or say I was stupid. In 2009 I sold that company to a mushroom importer at New Covent Garden Market after a journey that saw me sell truffles to Gizzi Erskin, Michelle Roux Junior and 100s of foodies across the UK.Boring Idea 3. FastMoveChange the conveyancing industry and make it better.Status: Proving feasibilityIt\u2019s not just crazy stupid ideas that should be shared. If your ideas sound boring, and you think no one will be interested you should share those too. People will give you feedback that will either help, or you\u2019ll find out your idea isn\u2019t getting interest and find out why.I shared my ambition to change the conveyancing industry (about the most boring idea you can have) with a contact of mine at Ark Publishing. For me to progress this idea I needed a conveyancer on the team. The number of conveyancers I knew was 0. 2 weeks later I had a LinkedIn Message from Sally. Sally had heard from her colleague, who it turned out had a meeting with one of my contacts colleagues, that I was planning to change the conveyancing industry and she had some ideas. We\u2019re now business partners in FastMove with a trial planned for our Artificial Intelligence driven conveyancing offering scheduled for February.If I hadn\u2019t shared that idea, I\u2019d still be sketching my thoughts on a napkin.Share your ideas widely to succeed.Many people who have an idea they believe is good are reluctant to share it. They think that I have an entrepreneurial engine I can use to magic their idea into reality and steal it from them.I don\u2019t.What I do have is more ideas than I could possibly fit into a life time. When you start sharing ideas and testing ideas, everybody, every single body, has more ideas than lifetime. The hard part is doing something with them.So, whatever your idea. To put a cattery on the moon or make a macro in excel, tell people about it and go on a journey.If you want to come on the journey of either making an airline for ski mad families or change the world of conveyancing or just want to tell me how clever I am (mum), get in touch!If you want my crazy brain to help with your innovation challenges also get in touch!", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Startup", "Entrepreneurship", "Customer Testing", "Private Jets", "Truffles"]}, {"title": "How to maintain product UX consistency?", "post_link": "https://medium.com/hunting-ux-design-truffles/how-to-maintain-product-ux-consistency-71f58df0a91f?source=search_post", "author_name": "Hannah Chen", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@HannahCDesign", "publish_date": "2015-11-09", "last_modified_date": "2019-04-06", "readtime": "4.67", "claps": 583, "voters": 560, "content": "How to maintain product UX consistency?Hannah ChenFollowNov 9, 2015 \u00b7 5 min readAtomic Design system chartCreate a design system with atomic methodology and Sketch toolWe all know the power of product consistency. Providing consistent user experience across different modules of your product can boost the usability. Once the users learn how to interact with a certain pattern in the system, they would assume the same workflow could apply on the other parts of the software. Maintaining product consistency will not only reduce the learning effort for users to navigate within the application, but also benefit the whole product development cycle, from design, engineering, to QA testing and documentation.I\u2019m recently helping our team build a design pattern library. This library will serve as a style guide to our design team internally. It was created in Sketch tool so that designers in the team can easily grab any components needed for future design projects. We use a Sketch plugin called Measure to export specs that our front-end development team can easily inspect element properties to create CSS style sheets. We also annotate styles and rules for testing and documentation reference.Methodology: Atomic DesignLike many other products in the industry, our platform evolves from decade-old technologies to trendy modern UIs on web and mobile. Inconsistency is unavoidable during this product evolution. When we first started this project, we went through a series of exercises finding inconsistent typographies, styles, colors, and patterns in the system. We used Frontify to collect a list of incorrect UI examples, as well as to identify one or two examples that we think are correct or acceptable. Even after identifying these working patterns, there is still a need to refresh the look and feel. Thus, a better methodology is required to create this design system.Inspired by Future Learn\u2019s design blog, I introduced Atomic Design as our methodology. The goal is to create a well-structured and sustainable design system, which contains five distinct levels as shown on the figure above: Atoms, Molecules, Organisms, Templates, and Pages.Create the pattern library with SketchAtoms:Atoms in our system refer to elements like form labels, buttons, links, etc. Let\u2019s take a button as an example: we would need to define the typography of the text, background color, border style, button size, and so on. Sketch provides a very easy way to organize your Text Styles and Shared Styles. In this example, I created a Text Style called \u201cprimary-button-text\u201d, which defines the text properties like typeface, weight, color, alignment, etc. I also created a Shared Style called \u201cprimary-button\u201d for the button style, which defines the button\u2019s color, borders, shadows, etc. Defining Text Styles and Shared Styles at the atom level, helps ensure the consistency of this pattern library, and also make it easier to organize and maintain. Besides that, we also need to annotate other properties at the atom level \u2014 here for the button, I specify the size of the button, as shown below.An atom \u2014 one button2. Molecules:When atoms like a primary action button and a secondary action button are bonded together, they become a molecule, serving as the smallest fundamental unit of a compound. Space in between the two buttons can be defined in the CSS style sheet\u2019s padding and margin properties. Rules of combining these two buttons into one molecule are needed \u2014 in this case, one rule can be: Always place the primary action button on the right, and the secondary action button on the left.A molecule \u2014 buttons group with a primary action and a secondary action3. Organisms:This primary and secondary buttons group can be used to form totally different organisms. It can be part of a modal window, or in our example, a commenting section. This organism consist of different molecule types \u2014 a profile picture, a text input area, and a buttons group. Organisms allow us to design standalone, portable and reusable components, which also require us to make very clear rules of how to combine different molecules under different scenarios. Sometimes, these rules can become very complex. We need to make sure the annotations of the rules are written clearly and cover as many use cases as possible.An organism \u2014 text input area follow by the buttons group4. Templates:Putting together an article organism and the commenting section described above, we make an article page template. Templates are very useful for our fast-paced agile development cycle, since the front-end team turns them into HTML format and reuses them for future development reference. Annotation or detailed specs will help engineers to implement the HTML templates correctly.A template \u2014 an article with some paragraphs of text and images, follow by a commenting area5. Pages:Replacing placeholders with real content brings the templates into live pages that users actually see in our application. Pages are the final deliveries and also the highest level of this Atomic Design System.A sample pageAnnotations and documentations for the Atomic Design SystemAs we mentioned before, clear annotations are important for future design, development, QA testing, and documentation cycles. Key elements to be marked include Text Styles, Share Styles, sizes and spacing, and rules. Here I summarized what should be documented on each level of the Atomic Design System. Please see the following table:Annotations to include in each level of the Atomic Design SystemExporting detailed specs for front-end developmentAnother trick for providing detailed specifications to engineers can be using Sketch plugins that generate style guides and resources automatically. Zeplin has more features but only give you one project for free. I use Measure, an open source, lightweight project. You don\u2019t need an account to use Measure. Here is a screenshot of specs exported by Measure:Specification example exported by the Sketch plugin MeasureThis pattern library project is still in progress.

Whiteboards are an important medium for the design process because it allows designers to communicate ideas with stakeholders, or users, in a very collaborative way. The team can sketch together, erase, and sketch again quickly while walking through ideas. A strong understanding of the purpose of a whiteboard exercise will help a candidate better demonstrate his/her competencies and qualifications during an interview.Typically a whiteboard challenge is not for evaluating how quickly a candidate can solve a problem. There is no right or wrong answer and therefore interviewers usually want to see how a candidate thinks on their feet. For example, is the candidate able to engage in collaborative problem solving with the team? Your interviewers are attempting to discern your ability to collaborate with future team members. Try and imagine a role play, where the interviewee is interacting with product managers, developers, user researchers and other potential extended team members. These team members can provide instructions as to what customers want, what technical limitations the designer has, and what research results are available.Key takeaway: Collaborate, collaborate, and collaborate!Below are some key strategies that can help further improve a candidate\u2019s white board interview.1. Ask questionsWhen you are given a challenge, don\u2019t hurry and think of a solution or answer. Ask questions to clarify the details of the challenge first. Don\u2019t make any assumptions, because your assumptions may be completely contrary to the team\u2019s product strategy. I am not implying that a candidate should not be creative. On the contrary, creativity is crucial as a designer. You must communicate your thought process clearly so that your team can understand your design standpoint. This ensures that everyone is on the same page.2. Think out loud!You can start your design process after clarifying the problem. It\u2019s ok if you need to think quietly and independently for a little while, but don\u2019t take longer than 2 to 3 minutes. Thinking out loud allows your interviewers to evaluate your thought-process, and guide you if you are on a wrong track.3. Ask for suggestions or adviceDon\u2019t be afraid to seek for help from your interviewers or to ask, \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d You are certainly going to encounter various problems in real work setting. And you will need the support of your team to overcome challenges. Think of your interviewers as future coworkers and members of your team. Asking for suggestions or advice is recommended and you can learn a little bit about their work styles in the process.4. Iterate your designThe worst thing you can do during a whiteboard exercise is to come up with an idea and try hard to sell it. This is not a product pitch, therefore your goal is not to convince someone to buy it. A good design requires a lot of fast iterations. Listen to the critiques and suggestions of your interviewers and quickly find out what works and what doesn\u2019t work. Iterate your design and take action to turn it into something that everyone in the room can agree on. Don\u2019t hesitate to erase anything on the board, but it\u2019s always a good practice to ask your interviewers if it\u2019s okay, just in case they haven\u2019t seen it or been able to take it down.5. Come up with a IA firstI would recommend coming up with a high level information architecture before diving into the interaction details. Be aware of time constraints because a whiteboarding session usually only lasts an hour or 30 minutes. Therefore the most efficient process is to define an IA and ask your interviewers to pick a feature for further interaction design. Remember your interviewers are acting as the product managers in this exercise, so they will help you prioritize the features to design. From time to time, confirm with them if you\u2019re heading in the right direction.6. Provide only one solutionUsually, during the UX design process, we explore multiple solutions for a given problem. We iterate toward our final recommended approach based upon results from user research, usability testing and A/B testing. However, an onsite interview whiteboard challenge comes with an implicit time limit. It\u2019s better to dive deeply into one design solution rather than to split your time. Your interviewers will appreciate if you provide a lot of ideas, but be sure to throw out bad ideas quickly so you can focus on the right solution.7. Draw cleanlyA lot of candidates might not pay attention to one critical element: draw clearly. When I recently helped our UX team with interviews I witnessed candidates draw hastily and messily on the board. They might have been nervous or worried about time, but my suggestion is not to rush. Scribbling is not going to save you time. Clear whiteboard writing not only gives your interviewers a good impression, but also helps you organize your thoughts. And unlike the other six tips that I mentioned above, which might need some real work experience, drawing clearly only requires a little practice. Start whiteboarding whenever you can. Practice drawing straight lines, boxes, circles, to buttons, links and pages.Talking through your thought process gives your interviewers a window into how you think. Ask questions and get suggestions from interviewers. This ensures that you are heading in the right direction. Discuss and iterate your design with interviewers. This allows both of you to see what your future collaboration would be like.", "responses": 4, "tags": ["Design", "UX", "Interview"]}, {"title": "How To Answer The UX Interview Question: What Tools Do You Use For Design?", "post_link": "https://medium.com/hunting-ux-design-truffles/how-to-answer-the-ux-interview-question-what-tools-do-you-use-for-design-447edf91b1c4?source=search_post", "author_name": "Hannah Chen", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@HannahCDesign", "publish_date": "2015-05-16", "last_modified_date": "2018-01-31", "readtime": "3.69", "claps": 41, "voters": 36, "content": "How To Answer The UX Interview Question: What Tools Do You Use For Design?Hannah ChenFollowMay 16, 2015 \u00b7 4 min readOne of the most common design interview questions is: What tools do you use for Design?The question might also come in a variety of different forms or expressions like the following:What are a few of your favorite design tools and why?What is your proficiency level of the listed design tools? Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign.If you could name one tool/application/software that you can\u2019t live without (from a design perspective), what would it be, and why?Why do interviewers almost always ask this question?It\u2019s an overused interview question, and to be honest, I rarely ask interviewees about what design tools they use. However, it can still be a valuable question for many reasons.A design team usually has shared design libraries, which contain guidelines and standards that the team members created in certain tools, and maybe template assets they want a new member to go with it and also contribute. That\u2019s why interviewers from the design team would ask about the tools that you use. It\u2019s very important that you agree with the team on this for collaboration.Sometimes your interviewers are actually your prospective (extended) team members, who may be product managers, software engineers, researchers, marketing specialists and/or other related product personnel. They would ask this also for collaboration purposes; however, they are more concerned about the final delivery formats.An interview isn\u2019t just a chance for a hiring manager to grill you; it\u2019s an opportunity to sniff out whether a job is the right fit for you. I have a friend who turned down an offer simply because she didn\u2019t believe in designing with PowerPoint, which was the only tool that company was using for UX design. I know it sounds unbelievable, but it is a true story!So, how do I answer this question?During an interview, your job is to sell yourself. A design interview is a perfect chance to show off your knowledge of UX and your fit for the role, by telling stories about your design process. Every designer has his or her own unique way to work around solving design problems. Talking about the tools you use to perform various assignments will help your interviewers to understand how you work.The answer to this question, as it is for many questions, is: it depends. Tell your interviewers stories about how you use the tools, not just show them receptacles for a long list of applications they already know. The details of the UX process I follow will depend on a number of factors: the scale or type of the project (responsive website vs. mobile app), the people that I work with, and the deadlines. I use a combination of different tools for each project and scenario:SketchesI sketch with paper and pen. There are many printable sketching templates online you can get and print out. Using these sketching papers helps me better determine the size of the UI elements for a specific device or platform.Paper prototypesI use POP a lot lately to create my paper prototypes for mobile design, by just simply taking pictures of the sketches, adding interactions, and sharing with the team.WireframesBalsamiq is a very effective tool for interactive wireframes, or semi-functioning prototypes. I use it mostly for my web design projects.High fidelity mockupsBesides the popularly used Adobe Creative Cloud and Bohemian Coding Sketch 3, I would highly recommend the Apple Keynote along with Keynote Bundle for UX hi-fi mockups. I can edit and customize the UI components, animate the interactions, and export as PDFs, images, QuickTime movies and even HTMLs. And it also works seamlessly with the Mac built-in app, Preview, for extracting visual elements such as icons.Interactive prototypesIt\u2019s easier to communicate design ideas with a click-through prototype, and get valuable feedbacks from others. I use applications like InVision and Axure \u2014 which allows me to import the designs, link multiple screens via hotspots; add gestures, transitions, and animations.In addition to the above, I would also pick 2 to 3 specific projects to talk about, where I choose one tool or method over another for certain situations.What if you are asked about a tool that you\u2019ve never used?Be direct and honest. Tell them if you\u2019ve never used it. Interviewers don\u2019t always expect you to be skillful in using every tool; they\u2019re looking for someone who can admit with confidence, \u201cI have never tried, but I\u2019m a fast learner.\u201d If they mention a tool you\u2019ve never heard of, take a mental note and look it up for next time. Since the UX industry evolves over time, you want to showcase your willingness to learn new techniques, and emphasize your enthusiasm for catching up with the latest design trend, quickly learning a new tool, and seamlessly integrating yourself into the daily aspects of a new workplace environment. It shows a strong work ethic and talent.Clipped from one of Onward Search\u2019s posters \u2014 A Guide to UX CareersFurthermore, be prepared to talk about some trending design apps, such as these apps listed in the section I clipped from one of Onward Search\u2019s posters.

It is more similar in nature to engineering, rather than design, in terms of how much information architecture and problem solving skills are involved in the process. There are some unique aspects of UX design that make it difficult for designers to get inspirations at random to apply to their projects. There is an overwhelming amount of online resources, galleries, and blogs \u2014 we will never lack information in this era \u2014 so the emphasis should be on where to find good ones and how to use them.Some sites are perfect when you kind of have a direction but no solid idea of what to do. Here\u2019s a good example of finding inspiration using Pinterest: I wanted to recycle my magazines, so I searched \u201cpaper crafts DIY\u201d and I ended up making these decorative drink coasters and paper flowers.However, UX design always comes with a guideline from the product managers. Every now and then, a product manager will tell you, Go crazy, it\u2019s time for innovation! But more often than not, most requests are something like, We need this new feature. Or, this and that are our commitment to the customers. Or the piece is broken, and so on.I\u2019ve been using Dribbble only to incorporate the latest visual design trends into my projects; but most of the time, I just use Google. Yes, just Google! Simply Googling keywords like, \u201c<something> ui design\u201d will get you not only some real examples but also good reading material.Question #1:Do you critique on the results from Google Images? Most of the examples might be outdated but they are usually classic UIs that people have been using for years. The crucial skill you need to develop as a UX designer is learning to identify good designs from the bad ones.Question #2:Do you read the basics about the design patterns or the design theory that you are trying to follow? It might be super simple, but sometimes you just need a little refreshment and keep up with new design techniques or trends (not only the visual trends), if you want to be in the game in this fast-paced world.If you are lucky and you get some \u201cGo crazy\u201d project, check out this collection of some of the best sites to boost your creativity:Pttrns | Mobile design patterns, resources and inspirationPttrns is the finest collection of design patterns, resources and inspiration.pttrns.comDaily InspirationThis post is part of our daily series of posts showing the most inspiring images selected by some of the Abduzeedo's\u2026abduzeedo.comInspiration BlogTry new free website builder and create your own professional website in a few minutes.

We could have done this step first using the \u201ctruffle compile\u201d command. Since we didn\u2019t do it, \u201ctruffle migrate\u201d did it for us.Next, it deployed the 3 contracts to the testrpc network. We got the transaction and contract addresses for each contract deployed. The number of transactions could be verified in ether explorer.In testrpc, there is no mining. So each block holds 1 transaction only. We saw 5 blocks, meaning 5 transactions. Wait, why 5 transactions? Looking at the console output carefully, there were 2 more transactions for \u201csaving migrations\u201d to the network, ie tx id 0xe2807a60304aea783a1b5a56eb4968a53ae4b8f58f97f55bcbd44d401cb9186c and 0x8e7d508dd570d6aca60d1cc3d7f5a6c3ea906a9e3399cfb7755b267cf4b36312. You could verify that they happened in block 2 and 5 respectively. Block 1, 3 4 were the actual deployment of the 3 contracts.Take block 5 for example,You (account holder) paid gas to change the state on the Migrations contract. So what exactly did you do?To cut the story short, let us look at the original Migrations.sol,pragma solidity ^0.4.4;contract Migrations {  address public owner;  uint public last_completed_migration;  modifier restricted() {    if (msg.sender == owner) _;  }  function Migrations() {    owner = msg.sender;  }  function setCompleted(uint completed) restricted {    last_completed_migration = completed;  }  function upgrade(address new_address) restricted {    Migrations upgraded = Migrations(new_address);    upgraded.setCompleted(last_completed_migration);  }}The Migrations.sol contract is required by the \u201ctruffle migrate\u201d command. Every time a migration step is completed successfully, \u201csetCompleted\u201d function is triggered to update the last_completed_migration number. In this case, \u201csetCompleted\u201d was ran 2 times because there were 2 deployment files in migrations folder, ie 1_initial_migration.js and 2_deploy_contracts.js. They were executed in sequential order. We could verify that the value of last_completed_migration was step 2.-> truffle console\ufefftruffle(development)> Migrations.deployed().then(function(ins){ins.last_completed_migration.call().then(function(v) {console.log(v)} )})truffle(development)> { [String: '2'] s: 1, e: 0, c: [ 2 ] }Why the hassle?While you could redeploy everything again easily using \u201ctruffle migrate \u2014 reset\u201d, it might not be practical to keep doing it in the real network simply because every deployment requires gas(ether).In the blockchain, every deployment is a transaction and every transaction is non reversible. The whole idea behind this architecture is to allow us to add/upgrade contracts and redeploy the affected contracts only. Imagine you have upgraded MetaCoin.sol, how would you deploy this contract without redeploying the other contracts? You will need to create a new migration script called 3_deploy_upgraded_metacoin.js for example and add it to the migrations folder.

Truffle provides many features to make your life as a smart contract developer easier. In this post, I\u2019ll focus on truffle test and describe my experience writing tests for a very basic smart contract.Getting StartedBefore reading this, you should have some familiarity with developing Ethereum smart contracts and Solidity. If not, I recommend reading:A 101 Noob Intro to Programming Smart Contracts on EthereumEthereum for Web DevelopersPart 1, Part 2, and Part 3 of the DApp tutorial by Mahesh Murthy.I reference my example project a few times in this post. This project contains some helpful patterns that you can use to test your contracts. I would also recommend looking at the tests in zeppelin-solidity. These are cleanly written and contain some useful reusable patterns.You\u2019ll also want to be familiar with testrpc, since this is the environment you\u2019ll most often run tests on.Truffle Testing BasicsTests in a Truffle project can be written in Javascript or Solidity. While creating the example project, I was able to implement all of my test cases in Javascript. I\u2019d recommend starting with Javascript tests if you\u2019re coming from a JS background. So far, I\u2019ve been able to cover all of my test cases with JS.Running truffle test executes all tests in your truffle project. This does the following:Compiles your contractsRuns migrations to deploy the contracts to the networkRuns tests against the contracts deployed on the networkKeep in mind that you can run truffle test against testrpc, a testnet, or even the main net (although that would be quite expensive). The recommended approach is to run against testrpc during development, and run against a testnet before deploying to main net. The primary advantages of running against testrpc are speed and the ability to run tests on a clean environment.Avoiding InteractionsI ran into some problems with unwanted interactions between my tests. These were happening for me for a few reasons:First, the examples in the Truffle docs use MyContract.deployed() to test against the contract instance deployed by truffle test. This presents a problem - if the state of MyContract.deployed() is modified by a test, this will affect subsequent tests. I ended up running MyContract.new() before every test instead, so each test is executed with a clean contract state. By doing this, I was able to execute single tests or change the order of tests without having to worry about getting different results.Another problem I had was related to testrpc account balances. When testrpc starts up, it is seeded with 10 accounts. Each one has a balance of 100 ETH. I had a few tests that involved these accounts paying ETH to my contract. With testrpc running in the background, and after many runs of my test suite, these accounts were depleted and my tests started failing. One obvious way to solve this is to write tests with smaller transactions. I opted instead to add an npm script to run testrpc, run my test suite, and kill testrpc after the test suite completes:(testrpc > /dev/null & truffle test) && kill -9 $(lsof -ti :8545)OpenZeppelin uses a similar technique, implemented in this scriptWrangling Your Promise ChainsEvery call or transaction you execute from web3.js or truffle is asynchronous. Truffle uses promises. web3.js uses callbacks. Either way, you\u2019re going to be writing a ton of asynchronous code.I can\u2019t stress enough how much async/await will help. You\u2019ll have to upgrade to Node 7.6 or higher. It may be the best decision of your life. Here\u2019s an example, before using async/await:Using async/await, this becomes:With async/await you\u2019re going to have a much easier time abstracting test helpers (see these examples). Your code will be less error prone, more readable, and more concise.DebuggingAt the time when I\u2019m writing this, there\u2019s no debugger for Ethereum smart contracts. This might feel like a bit of a hack, but I found it useful to write a helper function to output the state of my contract. The output logger for the ThresholdPool contract looks like this:(here it is in the example project)Within your tests, you can execute the state logger before or after making modifications to contract state. Since we\u2019re only reading data here and not modifying contract state, this should not affect the test results or account balances.Mock Contract PatternTruffle and testrpc don\u2019t provide any mechanism for mocking globally available variable values. You can accomplish this by implementing a mock contract. In the following example, I use a mock contract to mock current time, provided by the now variable in Solidity. The same pattern can be applied in order to mock any value in your contracts.First, I added a currentTime() function to my ThresholdPool contract and have it return now:currentTime() is used throughout ThresholdPool.sol to obtain the value of now. I override this in my mock contract, ThresholdPoolMock.sol, so that it returns a different value:Since ThresholdPoolMock extends ThresholdPool, I can now run all of my tests against ThresholdPoolMock. The mock contract lets me set the return value of currentTime() to any value when deploying my contract. I added another function, changeTime(), which lets me change the return value of currentTime() after the contract is deployed. Now I can run a transaction, call changeTime() to simulate passage of time, then run another transaction and test the result. Here\u2019s an example.*Note that you can also update time on testrpc using evm_increaseTime, see this example.That\u2019s It!Hopefully this helps you get started with your tests. Building a test suite while developing new smart contracts is an absolute necessity. Using truffle console or a similar client to test manually is useful for debugging, but not a replacement for test coverage. Since there\u2019s real money at stake, security and stability of your solidity code is incredibly important. I encourage you to leverage well tested contracts from well established libraries whenever possible. But when you choose to build contracts from scratch, make sure the code you deploy is well tested!", "responses": 7, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Truffle", "Solidity", "Smart Contracts"]}, {"title": "How to deploy a Truffle contract to Ropsten", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@guccimanepunk/how-to-deploy-a-truffle-contract-to-ropsten-e2fb817870c1?source=search_post", "author_name": "Gucci Punk", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@guccimanepunk", "publish_date": "2017-08-15", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-16", "readtime": "1.11", "claps": 360, "voters": 64, "content": "How to deploy a Truffle contract to RopstenGucci PunkFollowAug 15, 2017 \u00b7 2 min readWhen making the Ethereum smartcontract for Ethergoods (www.ethergoods.com) I had to struggle through a LOT!Assuming you have a truffle contract all compiled and ready, you need to configure your truffle.js file.

(In progress)IntroductionTestnet is a place to test your smart contracts solutions. Basically, it\u2019s a clone of the Ethereum network that allows you to deploy and test your smart contracts without paying real fees.There are several main testnets:Metamask captureRopsten Test Network \u2014 Proof-of-Work (PoW)Kovan Test Network \u2014 Proof-of-Authority (PoA)Rinkeby Test Network \u2014 Proof-of-Authority (PoA)Here\u2019s a bit on different consensus protocols.One step left to start! Before moving your contract to Testnet, make sure you have installed geth, truffle and Mist.Deploy contract from test RPC to testnet (Rinkeby)First of all, to deploy your project, you have to download the full rinkeby node (containing transactions by users for all the time).To download all chain data:Open your finder, for example at Documents.Create new folder, rename it as \u201crinkeby\u201d and open it.Create a new folder inside rinkeby and call it as \u201cchaindata\u201d.Open your terminal and go to Documents/rinkeby with command:$ cd Documents/rinkeby/And then to download all chain data run next command:$ geth --datadir=./chaindata --rinkebyYou will see something like this:Mind about this url. It is your path_to_your_ipc_fileCopy path_to_your_ipc_file somewhere.Progress of chain downloading you will find in next step in Mist.Quick Tip: Parameter \u2014 rinkeby says to geth that chain data has to be downloaded from rinkeby testnet.Create a test wallet with Mist and rinkeby networkOk, we have to pay for deploying out contract, so we need create ethereum account, because we have to pay for this work with gas (don\u2019t worry we will pay for not real money). So Mist will help us to do this.Quick Tip: Mist is an ethereum client where you can create your new wallets or manage them. More about it you can find here.To open Mist which will be connected to our rinkeby network we will use command (see example below):$ /path_to_your_application_/Contents/MacOS/Mist --rpc /path_to_your_ipc_filepath_to_your_ipc_file \u2014 you can find it at the beginning of this article.I have installed Mist into my applications. So in my case it looks like this:$ /Applications/Mist.app/Contents/MacOS/Mist --rpc /Users/bomalkevych/Documents/rinkeby/chaindata/geth.ipcAfter this command you will see Mist\u2019s banner:Mist starting (rinkeby network)Tap on \u00abLAUNCH APPLICATION\u00bb. (In some cases it can be launched automatically)In my case, all packets were downloaded (1.655.084)Then, you will see in the left bottom corner how much chain packets were downloaded. It can take you from several minutes to several hours depending on your internet connection and how much peers are connected to testnetwork.Quick Tip: If you want to see downloading status without Mist you can attach to connection (connection which you opened during step 1) and check it out in a terminal.So, to do this:Open a new terminal window (CMD + T)Run next command to attach to the connection:$ geth attach /path_to_your_ipc_filepath_to_your_ipc_file \u2014 you can find it at the beginning of this article.Again, in my case it looks like:$ geth attach /Users/bomalkevych/Documents/rinkeby/chaindata/geth.ipcFinally in this tab of terminal run next command:$ eth.syncingIt can return something like this:{ currentBlock: 13445, highestBlock: 1604086, knownStates: 32228, pulledStates: 19524, startingBlock: 0}What means what last block was loaded or can return \u00abfalse\u00bb what means that full chain was loaded.Create a new WalletIf you have one you can skip this step. How to create a new wallet and manage funds step-by-step you can find here.Adding funds to a test accountDuring our chain is loading, we can add some ether to our account. To do this, you have to:Open Mist, choose your wallet, and copy it\u2019s address.Copy address, copy anywayGo to https://www.rinkeby.io/#faucetThere are some short and clear information how to get funds. In several words:Choose some social network: facebook, google+ or Twitter.Make a post with the address wallet you copied before.Copy link to the post you made.Paste it in the input field on https://www.rinkeby.io/#faucet (see screen).Add funds to your walletWait while a block with your transaction will be added to blockchain register (It can take several minutes). To check status of your transaction use etherscan.EtherscanTo see details of your account transactions (history, statuses etc).Go to https://rinkeby.etherscan.ioPaste your wallet number as shown on screen:Scan transaction detailsOpen some transaction and see status. Result should be like:Example of transaction detailsDeploy contract with TruffleWhen syncing will stop (in first tab):Go to first tab in terminal and break syncing with (CONTROL+C) which we run during first step.Run command:$ geth --datadir=./chaindata --rinkeby --rpc --rpcapi db,eth,net,web3,personalOpen your project\u2019s truffle.js file.Replace from parameter in code below with your wallet number and paste it in your truffle.js.rinkeby: { host: \"localhost\", port: 8545, network_id: \"4\", // Rinkeby ID 4 from: \"0x99a4572656eb49FFEEFbe9588f8e7ab0F8D6Eb5e\", // account from which to deploy gas: 6712390}In my case, it looks like this:Remember! Replace from with your wallet address.Next step is to attach to the active connection we did at the begining of this Section and unlock our account. So to do this:Open a new terminal window (CMD + T)Run next command to attach to the connection:$ geth attach --rpc /path_to_your_ipc_filepath_to_your_ipc_file \u2014 you can find it at the beginning of this article.Again, in my case it looks like:$ geth attach /Users/bomalkevych/Documents/rinkeby/chaindata/geth.ipcFinally in this tab of terminal run next command (instead of 0x99a4572656eb49FFEEFbe9588\u2026 paste your wallet number):$ personal.unlockAccount(\"0x99a4572656eb49FFEEFbe9588...\")Input account password and press Enter. (It should return \u201ctrue\u201d)Open a new tab in the terminal and go to your project folder in terminal.Finally to deploy your contract, use command:$ truffle migrate --network rinkebyTroubleshootingFirst: If you want to redeploy your contract and you get a message like this:Using network 'rinkeby'.Network up to date.Try to delete build folder and run command again.Second: If you get error message during deploing which connected to gas limit.Check your truffle.js file you set gas value as: 6712390Thanks for reading!If you have other errors during deployment or you interested in another topic, please add comments and upvote \ud83d\udc4d.

This will be my attempt at a beginners guide to Truffle.There\u2019s a lot to love about the truffle framework:\u00b7 Truffle is a development environment, testing framework and asset pipline for Ethereum. Its main goal is to make life as an Ethereum developer easier. It is one of the most widely used IDE\u2019s in the Ethereum community.\u00b7 Automated contract testing with Mocha and Chai\u00b7 A configurable build pipeline that supports both web apps and console apps.\u00b7 Console to easily work with your compiled contracts\u00b7 Support for JavaScript, Coffeescript, sass, ES6 and JSX built-in.Don\u2019t get me wrong, truffle has some great documentation and you can\u2019t beat documentation straight from the source. But when I first started working with truffle, there was a gap, because a majority of the material was aimed at experienced Ethereum Dapp developers.There was nothing written for absolute beginners.As a means of trying to help fill this gap, and further my own understanding for the framework, I decided to write something. They say the best way to learn is to help teach someone. So the plan is simple: Write a series of articles I wish I had existed when I first started using truffle.The core ambition of this series is to try and be a bridge. It won\u2019t contain every last detail there is to know about the truffle framework, but it will contain everything that you need to know to make your first Truffle Dapp, while also helping you become a confident, independent problem solver. Hopefully by the time the series wraps up, you can say \u201cI know how to make this thing work\u201d. Do you feel the confidence?You\u2019ve probably heard all this before though. Every writer thinks their work is going to be the perfect reference material and will make the biggest difference. Let\u2019s at least give it a chance, so allow me to suggest:1. Make a nice cup or tea or coffee2. Find a nice quite place3. Work your ways through the seriesThe series are short, but I\u2019ll do my best to keep them flowing regularly so that you\u2019re not waiting long between each release.Let\u2019s begin. As a side note, if you prefer watching videos instead of reading, let me know and I\u2019ll see if I have some time to put together a video series that covers the same topics\u2026based on user demand.PrerequisitesI\u2019ve read a lot of technical tutorial series and I\u2019ve notices that authors tend to use the words \u201cfor beginners\u201d a little too easily. So, with that being said I want to clearly explain want you won\u2019t need to take advantage of this series.1. You won\u2019t need prior experience with the truffle framework. I won\u2019t dwell on what truffle is, but I will show you how to install it and how to start writing code as quickly and simply as possible.2. You won\u2019t need to have made a DAPP before. There are some theoretical aspects of Ethereum Dapp development that we won\u2019t cover, but if your primarily an Ethereum developer using solidity, that will work fine. You shouldn\u2019t have any trouble grasping the details of Dapp development with the truffle framework.3. You won\u2019t need to consult multiple other sources along the journey. You\u2019re free to consult other articles and tutorials, of course, but this series will be designed to be an all-encompassing introduction to the basics and will try to only reference the official truffle document library alone.You will, however, need a little background knowledge:1. You will need a basic understanding of Solidity. This means being familiar with state variables, functions, modifiers, events, and mappings. You don\u2019t need to be a solidity ninja, just be comfortable with the fundamentals.2. You will need a basic understanding of the Ethereum blockchain. This means being familiar with transactions, promises and calls.To acquire either of these skills, I\u2019d suggest reading the official solidity documentation and the Ethereum getting started tutorials\u00b7 Solidity Development Documentation\u00b7 Ethereum Project WebsiteWhat you\u2019ll need for this journeyWell, you don\u2019t need much to develop with truffle. This might seem like a minor detail, but you wouldn\u2019t believe the amount of people that switch frameworks because getting up and going was a frustrating multi-day exercise, before they even get a change to write some code.With truffle though, there\u2019s only a few things you\u2019ll need:1. You\u2019ll need a computer with a major operating system. This could be Mac OSX, Windows, Linux. All major operating systems are equally supported2. You\u2019ll need a text editor. This one is your choice, I\u2019m a fan of sublime text 3 \u2014 a cross-platform editor with plenty of plugins and productivity features. But like I said, completely up to you, so stick with whatever you prefer.3. You\u2019ll need a relatively modern web browser. Google chrome is my browser of choice, and since we\u2019ll be using it throughout the series, it might be worth installing a copy if you haven\u2019t already.And finally, you\u2019ll also need Truffle, and we\u2019ll install that in the next series.Final wordsI\u2019ll try and end each series with a summary of what we\u2019ve covered in that series, so for instance in this first series release, we\u2019ve learnt:\u00b7 Truffle is a framework that makes it easier for beginners to start building DAPP\u2019s for the Ethereum blockchain.\u00b7 You won\u2019t need a lot of background knowledge to get starting with truffle, but the more you know about solidity and smart contracts, the better.\u00b7 There\u2019s not that much setup to get you started with truffle, so there should be a very small gap between learning and actually writing code.Along the series, I\u2019ll also share a number of exercise, you don\u2019t have to complete the exercises \u2014 but it might be helpful to circle back after you\u2019ve worked your way through the core of the series, definitely worth trying at some point. Keep an eye out as we\u2019ll get things started in the next series.If you also want to follow my journey on creating an Ethereum based token for the Tap Project, you can follow us on Twitter: @Tap_Coin or swing by and have a chat with us on Telegram: https://t.co/eIP47QmZ1E", "responses": 4, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Development", "Guide", "Blockchain", "Dapps"]}, {"title": "Truffle Deep Dive: Ethereum\u2019s Swiss Army Knife", "post_link": "https://media.consensys.net/truffle-deep-dive-what-you-need-to-know-when-developing-on-ethereum-e548d4df6e9?source=search_post", "author_name": "Rika Sukenik", "author_link": "https://media.consensys.net/@rika.sukenik6", "publish_date": "2018-07-13", "last_modified_date": "2018-07-13", "readtime": "7.68", "claps": 409, "voters": 53, "content": "Truffle Deep Dive: Ethereum\u2019s Swiss Army KnifeRika SukenikFollowJul 13, 2018 \u00b7 8 min readA few weeks ago, we published a list of developer platforms, services, tools, and infrastructure to make Ethereum development less daunting.

Truffle is one of those companies, and I had the pleasure of interviewing several folks from the Truffle team to talk about topics including Truffle\u2019s mission, strategic goals, and culture. We also discussed ConsenSys\u2019 unorthodox organizational structure \u2014 a decentralized, flat meritocracy \u2014 and how Truffle has fine tuned this approach to self-organize in a way that works best for them.Before getting into the interview, however, I\u2019ll provide an overview of the Truffle suite of products, deep diving into some of the features that showcase Truffle\u2019s immense benefits. By the end, you\u2019ll have a full picture of how the Truffle suite really does make developing on Ethereum that much sweeter! So, let\u2019s bite right in.What is Truffle and is chocolate included?Truffle is a powerful development framework that makes building on Ethereum way easier. Chocolate is not included, but maybe Truffle can help you develop a DApp to validate the authenticity of a truffle and help us all from getting duped by fake ganaches!Alright, in all seriousness, Truffle is a must-have for Ethereum developers. Let me start by providing a brief history of the project and what problems Tim Coulter, Truffle\u2019s founder, set out to solve.Where it all started: a brief historyTim Coulter was faced with all of the same issues that plagued early Ethereum development: multiple libraries and 20+ steps to interact with smart contracts and deploy them to the Ethereum virtual machine. So, Tim started developing a series of libraries to handle all of the tasks and released the first version of Truffle in 2015. Today, Truffle has become the Ruby on Rails to Ethereum development. It is a mature framework and is on it\u2019s fourth release. The Truffle fam has grown, expanding to a suite of products that includes Ganache and Drizzle. Check out Truffle\u2019s suite usage dashboard. There were 80,000+ downloads of Truffle alone just last month!Today, Truffle is jam-packed with features to make your life as a developer easy peasy:Built in smart contract compilation: compile solidity code into Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecode and create an Application Binary Interface (ABI)Library linking: copy and paste addresses into bytecodeSmart contract testing: with mocha and chai, and a solidity testing framework. Javascript is supported as well for testing.Configurable build pipeline: support for custom build processesNetwork management: deploy to many public or private networks. Can migrate contracts to either a local test net e.g., Ganache (more on this later) or a live network like Ropsten, Rinkeby, or the main Ethereum networkFront-end integration: Drizzle (described in more detail below) handles boilerplate front-end tasks required by blockchain applicationsYour turn: getting started with TruffleAs I\u2019ve mentioned, Truffle is a mature suite of products. The team has created extensive documentation, including tutorials and even something that they call \u201cTruffle boxes\u201d complete with modules, contracts and libraries, front-end views, and entire dApp examples. If you are so inclined, you can even create your own Truffle box and share it with the community!I personally benefited from the Pet Shop Tutorial when I was just getting started with Ethereum development. The tutorial provides a great real-world example of how Truffle can be used to create a dApp to identify and track pet adoptions.Ganache and DrizzleTruffle is about to get even sweeter. If you haven\u2019t caved yet and found some chocolate to eat, I commend you \ud83d\ude04Ganache is a personal development blockchain based on Javascript that lives entirely on your local machine. It comes as either a CLI or a GUI, has detailed mining controls (allowing you to set gas limits and block time), has log output, is fully byzantium compatible, and even allows chain forking! (ability to run transactions or deploy contracts against the state of a live network such as mainnet or testnet, without spending any ether).Drizzle is a collection of front-end libraries that makes writing dApp front-ends easier. It handles crucial tasks like hooking up to the Ethereum blockchain via web3, instantiating contracts, and tracking contract data such as state, transactions, and events.Now for the sweeter stuff: Truffle team interviewNow that we have covered Truffle\u2019s functionality, let\u2019s get personal and have some fun with the Truffle team. Shout-out to g. nick d'andrea, Engineering Lead, for providing these responses.How is the Truffle team organized? How are decisions made?Truffle is a bit more hierarchical than other parts of ConsenSys. Everyone works on multiple projects simultaneously, there is a leadership team (although everyone serves on it), the team has goals and we work within constraints. Something that I found particularly interesting is a management decision list that the Truffle team uses to determine who has the authority to make decisions. There are 5 key pillars:Decisions you are empowered to makeDecisions you are empowered to make as a teamDecisions you are empowered to make, but must inform meDecisions you are empowered to make if I approveDecisions only I can makeThe team strives to create a culture in which all decisions fall into the first and second pillar.ConsenSys encourages flat meritocracy, but since it is also decentralized, spokes are free to make their own choices. Why did you decide to structure yourselves more hierarchically? What other organizational decisions have you made that may differ from the broader mesh?Truffle seeks to craft great software development tools as a sustainable business. Although the mesh-at-large has the opportunity and the leverage to explore alternative organizational structures, we feel that pursuing this within Truffle would be an experiment, as it lies outside our area of expertise and risks being orthogonal to our goals. That being said, ConsenSys\u2019 holocracy along with our own personal experiences with autonomy, transparency, and flat organizations provide powerful sources of inspiration in helping Truffle continue to refine its conception of organization and leadership.Can you walk me through a typical day?Since Truffle is 100% remote, there probably is no good description for a \u201ctypical day.\u201d I (Nick) usually wake up around 8 or 9, spend an hour or so getting settled in, and then proceed to spend my mornings catching up on email/GitHub/etc., and getting a sense for what\u2019s ahead. At 1PM, I meet with Chris (the other engineer working on Truffle) for our standup. We discuss issues and work going on, and then proceed to spend the afternoon as heads-down as possible. I try to finish up my work day by 7 or 8pm, with a long lunch somewhere midday.How do you build rapport and trust on your team?By encouraging everyone to have a voice, by keeping a \u201cbeginner\u2019s mind,\u201d by asking questions, and by recognizing that the craft of engineering software often includes a healthy amount of emotional commitment to our work.How do you decide to roll out new product features?Mostly based on what ideas sound exciting and attainable. We have a roadmap with a substantial backlog, so we try to schedule what\u2019s next based on what will help the community as well as make future tasks easier.Are there any exciting new releases or features you can let the community know about?Truffle v5 is coming soon, and we\u2019re quite excited about what\u2019s in store:Bring your own compiler! Specify whatever Solidity version you want, and Truffle will automatically download it. Or install Solidity yourself natively for something like a ~4x speed improvement.We\u2019re overhauling the migrations system to make it more reliable and more transparent. Truffle will detect problems with your migrations ahead of time and provide clear output that helps users see exactly what\u2019s going on.Upgrade to Web3js 1.0Improvements to the Truffle console (await, anyone?)and more!Where do you see Truffle in the next 5 years? What role will it play in the Ethereum ecosystem? What about the blockchain ecosystem?It\u2019s dangerous to make predictions like that. In 5 years, Truffle will be a mature suite of tools that provide a one-stop-chocolate-shop for smart contract and decentralized application development. Our products already are built on top of each other, and we expect that this relationship will only get stronger \u2014 e.g., Ganache will know about your Truffle projects and provide a GUI for seeing deployed instances, etc. Since the community has been so incredible at building all manners of tools, we expect Truffle to extend this integration even further and allow users to mix-and-match their favorite utilities in an easy-to-use way.How can the community get involved?Continue raising issues in our GitHub, helping each other with support in our Gitter channel, and of course, contributing great PRs.Are you hiring? If yes, for which roles?Truffle is hiring for all our products (Truffle, Ganache, Drizzle), and more! Expect to see job postings soon, as we hope to grow rapidly to keep up with the needs of the community.Big thank you to the Truffle team for all of their hard work in enabling the growth of the Ethereum and open source communities, helping to improve the role of decentralization in society, and empowering developers to achieve their goals. #missionaccomplishedSpecial shout out to Tim Coulter, g. nick d'andrea, and Ben Burns for giving me their sweet, precious time to conduct the interview.Have a sweet tooth?Check out TruffleCon in Portland, Oregon!Truffle GithubTruffle GitterConnect with me on Linkedin and Twitter!Disclaimer: The views expressed by the author above do not necessarily represent the views of Consensys AG.

Here, I lay out the questions I had and their answers.In this article, I cover these questions:How do I send Ether to a smart contract function?How do I generate a random number?How do I log events in a smart contract, and then read them as they occur?How do I send Ether to a smart contract function?There are some really good documentation on sending Ether to smart contracts, but it\u2019s gone through some iterations. Also, how you go about delivering funds to contracts depends on the medium you are using.If you are trying to send Ether to a smart contract via another smart contract, there is a really good write up of this process dated August 22, 2016 on the Ethereum Stack Exchange.If you are attempting to send Ether via web3, or a Truffle console, here\u2019s how I went about it:First, your smart contract must contain a payable function.This is an example of a constructor where you can initialize a smart contract with Ether:Solidity: function Contract() payable { }Here are some examples of payable functions in a smart contract:Solidity:function payableFunction() payable { }function payableFunction(uint randomVal) payable returns (bool) { }Here is how you call these functions from a web3 or Truffle console:truffle(development)> contract.payableFunction({from: address, value: etherAmount})truffle(development)> contract.payableFunction(randomVal, {from: address, value: etherAmount})What was stumping me was how I called the function to send Ether and pass it an arbitrary value as well. Turns out you pass your function parameters first, then a dictionary containing your from and value variables (which map to msg.sender and msg.value in Solidity).How do I generate a random number in a smart contract?Since the blockchain is deterministic, random numbers are practically impossible to create. Industrial strength solutions implemented in most gambling contracts where a lot of money relies on RNG typically rely on Oracles or ticket based solutions where multiple players submit a hash, and then all submissions are hashed and then revealed for a strong pseudorandomly generated number.I personally went the easy, one liner route, at least until my application evolves to handle more Ether:Solidity: // Generate a random number from 1-MAX_VALUE (MAX_VALUE is set // arbitrarily by the developer). uint random_number = uint(block.blockhash(block.number-1))% MAX_VALUE + 1;How do I handle events in a smart contract?Events are a notoriously tricky, convoluted subject in Ethereum development. I figured out how to handle an error condition as well as logging an event in the following manner.First, define an event in your Solidity smart contract:event Error(address indexed _sender, bytes32 error);the indexed keyword is important, as that\u2019s how we track events by the accounts who called the contract function.Here is how the event is called in the contract function:Error(msg.sender, \"ERROR_DETAILS_HERE\");Here is how we use web3 in the Truffle console to track events:truffle(development)> var errorEvent = contract.Error({_sender: web3.eth.coinbase})truffle(development)> errorEvent.watch(function(err, result){ console.log(result.args) })Then, when we call the function and an event is caused, our watcher can grab it, read it, and respond accordingly.Hope this helped! I\u2019m putting together a more comprehensive article on development, but will be releasing things that I learned along the way.If you liked this article, please recommend it and share it with your friends!Hit me up on Twitter: @valkn0t", "responses": 4, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Solidity", "Truffle", "Web3", "Tutorial"]}, {"title": "How to use Drizzle (Truffle and React) to make the best front end for your Ethereum DApp", "post_link": "https://itnext.io/how-to-use-drizzle-truffle-and-react-to-make-the-best-front-end-for-your-ethereum-dapp-ee09c8e94eae?source=search_post", "author_name": "Zac Holland", "author_link": "https://itnext.io/@zacharyholland_17606", "publish_date": "2018-05-23", "last_modified_date": "2018-07-20", "readtime": "2.77", "claps": 311, "voters": 49, "content": "How to use Drizzle (Truffle and React) to make the best front end for your Ethereum DAppZac HollandFollowMay 23, 2018 \u00b7 3 min readI\u2019m working on a DApp and just I started developing the front end. At first, I was just using Web3 and React but it was a nightmare trying to connect to MetaMask and get everything to be reactive.This is where Drizzle comes in.Drizzle is a library that takes care of handling the user\u2019s provider (MetaMask, Mist, etc.) and making all the incoming data play nice with React. The only catch is that it\u2019s kind of confusing to get started with. It took me about 3 hours to figure out what Drizzle was doing, so I want to make sure no one else has to go through that.Setting up Truffle and DrizzleThe first step is to set up Truffle and Drizzle. Truffle comes with a collection of \u201cboxes\u201d that are basically just templates. Follow these steps to set up your Drizzle template.This will set up Truffle with a small collection of simple contracts and a basic front end. The main file for this project is the Home layout (Home.js). Here\u2019s where Drizzle comes into play.Here\u2019s where it get\u2019s confusing.Home.js, How is it Getting Data?First, take a look at HomeContainer.js.mapStateToProps is going to tell Drizzle which contracts you want to get as stateful props. When you call drizzleConnect, these contract states will then be passed as props to your component.These props are just states that contain the data you\u2019ve received for a certain contract. You can\u2019t make any kind of calls with these objects.If you want to make any contract calls, you need to use the drizzle variable that\u2019s given to a component via context (this will make more sense when we make our own component). Home doesn\u2019t ask for the drizzle variable though, so it needs some help to get data.Let\u2019s look at a line of code in Home.jsThe contract SimpleStorage has a method called storedData which simply returns whatever data is being stored in the contract.ContractData is a component given to us by drizzle-react-components .You can look at the source code for ContractData here.ContractData is it\u2019s own Drizzle connected component that will make a call to the contract and display the data as text. This is great for testing, but what if we want to render the data in another way?Creating Our Own Drizzle ComponentFirst, let\u2019s make the container. I\u2019ll be calling this component GetTokens because it will be simply getting the current user\u2019s balance from the TutorialToken contract.In mapStateToProps, I tell Drizzle that I want to get the data from the TutorialToken contract as a prop. I then call drizzleConnect to create the container, using GetTokens as the component.First look at lines 31\u201333. I\u2019m making sure I specify that this component should receive the drizzle variable in the context. This is what holds all the actual objects for my contracts and allows me to make calls.Now look at lines 9 and 10. I get the drizzle variable from the context, and then make the balanceOf cacheCall which will return the key for the data, and cache the result in the TutorialToken prop.We now need to get the data using this key.In line 21 we now see how the contract props are used. The TutorialToken object that\u2019s passed as a prop will have an object for each method. When a call to a method is made, the prop will be updated with the result reactively.We then use the dataKey we got from the cacheCall to get the value.ConclusionI know I didn\u2019t do the best job writing this out, but hopefully just that simple example of a component that receives data from a contract will be helpful!In summary, you need to get the state of a contract as a prop, but also get the drizzle variable in order to make calls.If anything is still confusing let me know in the comments and I\u2019d be glad to help!", "responses": 7, "tags": ["JavaScript", "Drizzle", "React", "Ethereum"]}, {"title": "Debugging Smart Contracts with Truffle Debugger: A Practical Approach", "post_link": "https://medium.com/coinmonks/debugging-smart-contracts-with-truffle-debugger-a-practical-approach-3410e9d20837?source=search_post", "author_name": "Mayowa Tudonu", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@mayowatudonu", "publish_date": "2018-11-02", "last_modified_date": "2018-11-02", "readtime": "12.7", "claps": 363, "voters": 50, "content": "Debugging Smart Contracts with Truffle Debugger: A Practical ApproachMayowa TudonuFollowNov 2, 2018 \u00b7 13 min readGiven enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow. ~ Linus\u2019 LawBugs! Bugs are aliens that creep into a programmer\u2019s code at night when no one is watching and alter the state of a working code. These aliens have only one mission \u2014 to frustrate the life of a programmer. How does a programmer kill a bug before he dies of frustration? Yeah, you got it right! By debugging and removing the buggy code. But why would a programmer go into a debugging war without the right tools? If a programmer is going to debug he better do it the right way, using the right tools.If debugging is the process of removing software bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in. ~ Edsger DijkstraIn smart contract development, like traditional centralized software development, bugs creep into the smart contract developer\u2019s code during the development lifecycle of the smart contract. While there are \u2018Etherillion\u2019 reasons why smart contracts could be buggy, one thing remains important, all bugs must be removed before the smart contract is deployed on the mainnet, or else, we risk losing funds and ultimately, the credibility of the smart contract.There are several frameworks for developing smart contracts in solidity. In this article, the focus is on the Truffle Framework. Truffle aims to make a developer\u2019s life easier by providing a development environment, testing framework, and debugging tools for smart contract development. Smart contract bugs can be hard to find, and error messages can be very obscure. When building smart contracts using Truffle, the Truffle Debugger comes in very handy when it is time to debug a contract. This is because when debugging a smart contract, you\u2019re not running the code in real time; instead, you are stepping into the historical execution of that transaction on the blockchain, and mapping that execution onto its associated code. This process of debugging can be tedious to reason about traditionally, and this is where the Truffle Debugger really helps \u2014 by allowing us to debug any transactions as long as we have the code and the artifacts of the transaction. Let\u2019s talk briefly about the Truffle Debugger and then take an example to show how this tool can be used.Debugging is a cyclic activity involving execution testing and code correction.Truffle DebuggerTruffle Debugger is a command line tool integrated into the Truffle Framework which allows smart contract transactions to be debugged using the smart contract code and transaction artifacts. When the debugger is started, the command line interface provides a list of addresses transacted against or created during the course of the transactions, an initial entry point for the transaction and a list of available commands for using the debugger. Some of the debugger commands are highlighted below:[o] step over:This command evaluates the instructions evaluated by the virtual machine relative to the contract until the next line in the current smart contract file, skipping the functions referenced at the current execution point(if any).[i] step into:This command steps into the function called at the current execution point.[u] step out:This command will have the debugger step out of the current function, to the next line executed right after it.[n] step next:This command steps to the next logical statement or expression in the current function called.[;] step instruction:This command steps through each individual instruction evaluated by the virtual machine.You can check out other commands hereThus far, we have talked about debugging, and the Truffle Debugger, let\u2019s have an example to really drive this home.Debugging a FoodCart smart contractThe smart contract below models a simple food cart which allows anyone to add food items to the cart for sale and also allows anyone with enough ether to buy a food item off the cart. This contract is just for the purpose of illustration, and it should not be used in a production environment. Before we start this example, the following are required to follow this example without any issues:Truffle 4.0 or aboveSolidity compiler version 0.4.24 or abovePrivate blockchain (Ganache CLI v6.1.6 or above)The repository for this article can be found here, just in case you want to follow through the debugging process without coding the smart contract.Step 1: Building the smart contractLet\u2019s start by creating a directory for this project and building the smart contract. At the terminal enter in the following commands:mkdir FoodCartEnter into the folder and create a bare the truffle project.cd FoodCarttruffle initNavigate into the contracts folder and create a FoodCart.sol smart contract filecd contractstouch FoodCart.solOpen your FoodCart project in any IDE of your choice. I will be using Visual Studio code. Why? I really don\u2019t know \u2026lol. \ud83d\ude02. Open the FoodCart.sol contract and type in the smart contract below:Before we proceed any further, let me explain the smart contract above. The FoodCart smart contract can be sectioned into 6 parts:The state variables: The state variables, owner and skuCount store the address of the owner and the count of food items added to the FoodCart respectively. The mapping foodItems maps skus to food items.The enum: The State enum is a user-defined data type that holds the state of the food items on the cart. The types listed in the enum are explicitly convertible to and from integers, i.e (ForSale = 0, Sold = 1).The events: The events ForSale and Sold log the details of the food items that are put on sale or sold. These events can be called by callbacks in javascript and their contents can be used to make using dApps more interactive.The struct: The struct FoodItem is a user-defined type which holds the properties of a food item. These properties can be accessed using a dot notation on the struct.The function modifiers: The modifiers doesFoodItemExist, isFoodItemForSale, and hasBuyerPaidEnough are functions that automatically check a condition prior to executing the function on which they are applied to. The roles of the function modifiers used in this smart contract are obvious from their names.The functions: The functions addFoodItem, buyFoodItem and fetchFoodItem adds food items to the contract, allows a food item to be bought and allows the details of food item to be viewed respectively. The constructor function initializes the owner state variable with the address that the contract is deployed on. The anonymous payable function allows ether to the sent to this contract.Step 2: Deploying the smart contractLet\u2019s deploy the smart contract on the private network.In your IDE, create a new file called 2_foodcart_migration.js in the migrations folder. Open this file after creating it and add this code:This piece of code will enable the framework to deploy our FoodCart.sol contract to the private blockchain.Open your terminal and navigate into the folder for this project and type this command:truffle developThis command starts a development blockchain with which we can start testing our contract. Running that command should produce this result:The image above shows that a development blockchain has been started on port 9545, test accounts have also been created for use, and the terminal is navigated to a new prompt truffle(develop)>.In the truffle(develop)> prompt, type the compile command to compile the contract. The result of the compilation is stored in the build folder of your project directory.truffle(develop)> compileRunning the compile command should produce this result:Finally, let\u2019s migrate the compiled contract to the blockchain for deployment. At the terminal, type the migrate command to migrate the contract to the development blockchain that has been started for us.truffle(develop)> migrateRunning the migrate command should produce this result:Step 3: Interacting with the smart contractLet\u2019s interact with our smart contract and get a feel of how it works. We will be adding food items to the food cart, checking the details of food items added to the cart, and also buy food items off the cart with Ether from one of the accounts created for us when we started the development blockchain.Still in the truffle(develop)> prompt, create a foodCart variable and store the instance of the deployed contract in it.truffle(develop)> let foodCart; truffle(develop)> FoodCart.deployed().then((instance) => { foodCart = instance; });In the short code snippet above, we access the deployed FoodCart contract via the web3 .deployed method which returns a promise interface and we pass a function which stores the instance of the deployed contract in the foodCart variable. With the instance of the contract stored in the foodCart variable, we can access the functions of the contract through the foodCart variable.Let\u2019s add some food items to the food cart by running the following code snippets at the truffle(develop)> prompt. First, let\u2019s add a function that will help us add food items and print the result of the transaction at the console easily.The addFoodItemToCart function allows us to easily add food items to the cart by passing the name and price of the food item to the function as arguments when it is called. The function acts as a wrapper for the addFoodItem in the smart contract by making the smart contract calls for us and formating the log output returned from the function call. We can add some food items with the addFoodItemToCart function by running this commands:Now that we have about 3 food items on the the food cart, let\u2019s buy some food items off the cart. Before we can buy a food item, we need to specify what address we will be using to make our purchase, because it is from this address that we can get the funds in ether to buy food items. Recall that when we started our private blockchain, 10 test accounts were created for us and each of these accounts was credited with 100 ether which we can use to buy anything we want, we are rich \ud83e\udd11\ud83e\udd11. Let\u2019s create a variable to store one of these addresses or accounts so that we can easily call it anytime we want.truffle(develop)> const buyerAddress = web3.eth.accounts[1]; truffle(develop)> buyerAddress '0xf17f52151ebef6c7334fad080c5704d77216b732'Since we have an account 0xf17f52151ebef6c7334fad080c5704d77216b732 (yours will be different), we can add a function to buy food items off the food cart at our truffle(develop)> prompt.The buyFoodItemFromCart allows us to buy food items off the cart by calling the function with the itemSku and amount of the item. The amount to be paid for the item is taken from the account that was stored in our buyerAddress variable. Let\u2019s buy Fried Rice off the food cart. From our previous transactions, we recall that the sku for Fried Rice is 0 and it\u2019s price is 10 wei. So at the truffle(develop)> prompt, we call the buyFoodItemFromCart function with these values:From the output, we see that the state of the item is Sold and the foodItemExist is now false, indicating that this item is no longer for sale.Step 4: Debugging errors in the smart contractIf you have made it thus far, you deserve a Noble prize for Tenacity \ud83c\udf96, enjoy the fame it brings. So far, we have seen how the contract should behave. To be able to use the Truffle Debugger feature, we would introduce some errors while interacting with the contract and then use the debugger to debug the error and get it fixed. To debug a transaction, we need to have the hash of the transaction and then run command debug [transaction hash] at the truffle(develop)> prompt followed by any of the debugger commands until we find out where the transaction failed.We will try the following invalid transactions:Try to buy a food item that does not existTry to pay an amount less than the price of a food itemBefore we start these transactions, we need to start the truffle develop logger in another terminal, but still in the sample project. Open a new terminal, navigate to the FoodCart project and run this command truffle develop --log.FoodCart $ truffle develop --logYou should get this output:Connected to existing Truffle Develop session at http://127.0.0.1:9545/The logger connects to an existing session at the port specified, listens for transaction events, and logs the output of the transaction which should include items like transaction hash, block number, etc. Let\u2019s go ahead and make the life of our contract a living hell \ud83d\udc79.Invalid Transaction #1: Try to buy a food item that does not existFrom our previous transaction where we added food items to cart, we had skus 0, 1, 2 respectively for the 3 food items. We will try to use the sku 6 to buy a food item that does not exist.Trying to buy the item as shown in the command above produces the error UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: Error: VM Exception while processing transaction: revert ... which does not really tell us what or where the problem came from. Now, this can be a real headache when there\u2019s no debugger. I have spent many hours trying to debug a smart contract without using the debugger and it can drain the last blood out of one. Let\u2019s have a look at log output and see what we have there.The most important content of the log to us is the transaction hash 0x90a2ef83e54426848523a4edcf0c9628045e03c69d95f989c5b3b557367c848c, this will be different from what you have on your machine. With the transaction hash, we can debug the transaction and figure out where the problem is. Let\u2019s debug this transaction. Copy the hash of the transaction from your debugger terminal and run this command: debug your-trasanction-hash at the truffle(develop)> prompt. Your output should look like this:From the image, we see that when the debug command is run, the debugger compiles the contracts, gathers transaction data, fetches the address that was affected and the contract that was deployed at that address, and shows a list of debugger commands that we can use to interact with the debugger. The most interactive command to use at the debugger is the step next command which steps through all the instructions executed during a transaction one at a time. The step next command is executed by pressing enter or n, at the keyboard of course.At the debug(develop:0x90a2ef83...)> prompt, press enter continuously, following each instruction step until we reach the instruction where the transaction failed. There are 8 steps before we reach the final instruction that halted our transaction - you will have to press enter 9 times to reach the halting instruction. Let\u2019s look at the first 4 steps from this image below:From the image, we see that at line 61, the buyFoodItem function was called, but before the execution of the function, the modifier doesFoodItemExist at line 64 was called to check if the food item to be bought exists in the cart. On further inspection, on line 33, we see that the modifier uses the require function to ensure that the foodItemExist property of the food item with the sku given is true. Let\u2019s check what happened in the rest of the steps in the image below:At last step on line 33 in the image above, we see that the transaction halted because the transaction failed the required condition to be able to buy a food item from the cart. The item that we wanted to buy does not exist. The require function throws a state-reverting exception when a condition to which it is applied to fails. A state-reverting exception reverts or undoes all changes made to the state in the current call (and all its sub-calls) and also flag an error to the caller. We have been able to successfully debug this code using the Truffle Debugger, and it has been pretty amazing.Invalid Transaction #2: Try to pay an amount less than the price of a food itemIn this transaction, we will try to buy a food item with less amount than the price of the food item. In \u2018step 3: Interacting with the smart contract\u2019, we added 3 food items. Let\u2019s try to buy \u2018Chicken Pepper Soup\u2019 with sku 1 and price 10 wei. At the truffle(develop)> prompt, call the buyFoodItem function to buy a food item with less amount than the price.truffle(develop)> buyFoodItemFromCart(1, 5); truffle(develop)> (node:40269) UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: Error: VM Exception while processing transaction: revertExpectedly, this transaction fails, giving a cryptic error message as usual. To debug this transaction, we go to our log terminal and copy the hash of the transaction. On my machine the transaction hash is 0x5dc12d3ac524cfd1e3c0ea9265a155149ff16fcb18f904016a87e83cca5f9a30. With this transaction hash, we shall debug the transaction and figure out where the transaction halted.truffle(develop)> debug 0x2ad4c056a678f221d761d0bc11f641f6b4e63b3016587acd8b16ccf5295bd4d3Like we did in the first debugging process, we will use the step next debugger command to step through the transactions as it is very interactive and shows all the instructions that have been executed until we reach the instruction that halted the transaction. Use enter to step through the transaction history until you reach the instruction that halted the transaction as shown in the image below:In the image above, we see that at line 44, the modifier hasBuyerPaidEnough is called before the buyFoodItemFromCart function is executed, and at line 45, the modifier requires that value sent by the buyer is greater than or equal to the price of the item. However, we know that we flouted this condition hence, it halted our transaction. So if we send the right amount, we will surely buy the food item we need.ConclusionIn conclusion, the importance of using a debugger while building smart contracts cannot be overemphasized. With a debugger, we can test our modifiers to ensure that our contract behaves appropriately, we can ensure that our contracts are secure by sending malicious transactions to our contract to see how it will behave and properly debug the transaction to see the instructions that have been executed up until the transaction halted, if it did. Most importantly, we can save our most valuable asset which is time, by using a debugger whenever we face issues with our smart contracts, instead of fumbling around with our code.References:Truffle DebuggerDebugging and TestingIntelliJ IDEA Debug ToolsOriginally published at www.mayowatudonu.com.", "responses": 2, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Truffle", "Smart Contracts", "Programming", "Tutorial"]}, {"title": "How to create a DApp using Truffle, Oraclize, ethereum-bridge and Webpack", "post_link": "https://medium.com/coinmonks/how-to-create-a-dapp-using-truffle-oraclize-ethereum-bridge-and-webpack-9cb84b8f6bcb?source=search_post", "author_name": "Lander Willems", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@WWWillems", "publish_date": "2018-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-20", "readtime": "8.75", "claps": 361, "voters": 48, "content": "How to create a DApp using Truffle, Oraclize, ethereum-bridge and WebpackLander WillemsFollowMay 11, 2018 \u00b7 9 min readA simple guide on using external API data in a Smart Contract front-endAbout this tutorialAfter completing this tutorial you\u2019ll have a working DApp (Decentralised Application) reacting to Events emitted via a Solidity Smart Contract using Oraclize to fetch external API data from Coinbase.

I\u2019m a Digital Consultant and product builder from Belgium. When I\u2019m not dabbling in Solidity, I\u2019m working on TeamHut, a SaaS to help freelancers and digital teams organise & share their digital content.StartPrerequisitesYou\u2019re able to clone a git repository & install it\u2019s dependencies via npmYou have basic knowledge of HTML, JavaScript, Webpack, terminal, \u2026You\u2019re looking to learn more about using Oraclize & Solidity EventsWhat will we be making?We\u2019ll be writing a Smart Contract that fetches external API Data using a locally running Oracle. We\u2019ll do this by emulating the Oracle using ethereum-bridge. The contract fetches the current Ethereum USD price from the Coinbase ETH-USD spot price API.We\u2019ll be creating a simple HTML page that shows our contract\u2019s total ETH balance both in ETH and in USD. The total USD value of your contract is calculated using the Coinbase API. The values auto-update until the contract runs out of funds.Tools usedGit, npmTruffle, Truffle webpack box, oraclize-apiethereum-bridgeJavascript, WebpackWhat is an Oracle?Smart contracts, by their nature, are able to run calculations and store and retrieve data. Because every node runs every calculation, it\u2019s not practical (and presently impossible) to make arbitrary network requests from an Ethereum contract. Oracles fill this void by watching the blockchain for events and responding to them by publishing the results of a query back to the contract. In this way, contracts can interact with the off-chain world.\u201cOracles allow external data, as in non-blockchain data, to be sent to contracts.\u201dOracles are trusted data feeds that send information into the Smart Contract, removing the need for Smart Contracts to directly access information outside their network, thus lightening their workload. Oracles are usually supplied by third parties and are authorized by the companies that use them.The oracle/oracle network is the party in charge of connecting you to the data-source. If you\u2019d like to read more about Oracles, see here.Let\u2019s goInstall TruffleFirst of all, let\u2019s fire up our terminal and install Truffle globally:$ npm install -g truffleWe\u2019ll use Truffle to migrate our contracts, run our development testnet and install Oraclize. It\u2019s an essential tool if you\u2019re serious about Solidity development.Create a new Truffle projectCreate a new folder for our project, called oraclize-test:$ mkdir oraclize-testNavigate into the folder and create a new Truffle project.We\u2019re starting from a Truffle webpack box, which will make it easier for us to create our DApp\u2019s front-end.$ cd oraclize-test$ truffle unbox webpackAfterwards, start the Truffle testnet (testrpc):$ truffle developYou should see something like this:Notice:How the second line printsTruffle Develop started at http://127.0.0.1:9545Write down this host:port combination, you\u2019ll need this in order to start ethereum-bridge.The amount of accounts created (=10)Nice, you\u2019ve created a bootstrap Truffle project, and launched the Truffle development testnet. Close the testnet by pressing (ctrl+c) and continue by adding Oraclize to Truffle.Add Oraclize to TruffleAdd Oraclize to Truffle and restart the Truffle development testnet$ truffle install oraclize-api$ truffle developNotice how, after installing oraclize-api, a new folder has been created in our oraclize-test folder: installed_contracts. In it, you\u2019ll find the Oraclize contract called usingOraclize.sol which our Solidity Contract will be inheriting from.Our oraclize-test folder now looks like thisoraclize-test folder contentsKeep the testnet active, and open a new terminal window to install ethereum-bridge.Install ethereum-bridgeCreate a new folder (next tooraclize-test) called ethereum-bridge Clone the ethereum-bridge repository, and install it\u2019s dependencies:$ mkdir ethereum-bridge$ git clone https://github.com/oraclize/ethereum-bridge ethereum-bridge$ cd ethereum-bridge$ npm installNoteWe\u2019re creating the ethereum-bridge folder next to our oraclize-test as we can re-use it in later projects.You can run node bridge -a 9 to start ethereum-bridge. The -a 9 argument instructs ethereum-bridge to use the last account created by our local Truffle Testnet node to deploy the Oraclize contract. This address should only be used for Oraclize, no other contract is meant to use it.The Truffle Testnet node creates 10 accounts for you to work with, as their index is 0-based, we\u2019re using the index of 9.Go on, try it:$ node bridge -a 9Whoops:As you can see, we\u2019ve ran into an error. If you read the ERROR line closely, you can see ethereum-bridge is trying to connect to the wrong host:port combination (http://localhost:8545).This combination should reflect the combination you wrote down in the previous step. In my case that\u2019s http://localhost:9545. Be sure to double-check this as older Truffle versions used to use port 8545.To resolve this, start ethereum-bridge telling it to use the right host (-H) & port (-p argument). Mind the flags, they\u2019re case-sensitive!$ node bridge -a 9 -H 127.0.0.1 -p 9545 --devThe result should look like this:Look for the line that looks like:OAR = OraclizeAddrResolverI(0x6f485C8BF6fc43eA212E93BBF8ce046C7f1cb475)NoteIf you\u2019re using a different mnemonic than the standard Truffle one, the ETH address shown in between the round brackets will be different.Make sure you write down (copy paste) the completeOAR line, so we can use it in the constructor of our contract later. Again, leave your terminal running.At this point you should have 2 active terminal windows:Your Truffle develop testnetYour ethereum-bridgeWrite the Solidity Smart ContractLet\u2019s get started with a sample Smart Contract. Look for the contracts folder in the oraclize-test folder and add a new file OraclizeTest.sol. This will become the Smart Contract that sends transactions to the Oracle to fetch API data. Copy paste the following gist into the file:NoteMake sure you replace the OAR = OraclizeAddrResolverI(0x...); line with the one you wrote down in the previous step.Don\u2019t forget to remove this OAR variable from your constructor before production, this is just for testing, in production it will automatically fetch the OAR depending on the chain you\u2019re running it, currently the Mainnet, Ropsten, and browser-solidity VM environment are supported.OraclizeTest.solUpon contract creation, theOraclizeTest() constructor is being run, which sets the owner to the address deploying the contract and initialises the Oracle. Afterwards, it calls the update() function once to fetch the current ETH price from the Coinbase API.The update() function checks if the contract holds enough funds to create an URL request, and continues to make the request to Oraclize if it has.The __callback() function is being called by Oraclize as soon as the request has completed, you can use JSONPATH to slice the response. See documentation here.We can use the first parameter idin the __callback() function to handle different requests. We\u2019ll be skipping this, as this is only a basic example.Compile the codeLook for the contracts folder in oraclize-test and delete ConvertLib.sol and MetaCoin.sol. These are example files, we won\u2019t be needing them.Copy paste the contract code mentioned above into OraclizeTest.sol and compile the code using$ truffle compileIf it compiled successfully, you should see a new folder in oraclize-test called build. This folder contains the compiled version of your Smart Contracts. In it, you\u2019ll find some *,json files that contain the bytecode that will be deployed by Truffle.Now, let\u2019s prepare Truffle to deploy our code to our development testnet.Update Truffle configOpen truffle.js in your oraclize-test folder and add your development environment:truffle.jsHere, we\u2019re defining the development network (=environment), and setting the port number.Update Truffle migrationsOpenoraclize-test/migrations/2_deploy_contracts.js and edit it to resemble this snippet:oraclize-test/migrations/2_deploy_contracts.jsIn this gist we\u2019re importing the compiled version of OraclizeTest.sol contract and instructing Truffle migrations how to migrate the contract.If we wouldn\u2019t do this, Truffle wouldn\u2019t know which files to deploy. It\u2019s pretty standard stuff, look into Truffle migrations if you\u2019re interested.We\u2019re funding the Smart Contract with 0.5 ETH (500000000000000000 wei) so we\u2019re able to talk to Oraclize. We need ETH to be able to pay for the gas when sending transactions.Run truffle migrate --develop --reset to deploy your contract to the testnet. You should see something resembling this:Successful Truffle development testnet migrationThis will run all migrations located within your project\u2019s migrations directory. At their simplest, migrations are simply a set of managed deployment scripts. If your migrations were previously run successfully, truffle migrate will start execution from the last migration that was ran, running only newly created migrations. If no new migrations exists, truffle migrate won't perform any action at all. You can use the --reset option to run all your migrations from the beginning.As you can see in the screenshot, Truffle deployed the contract to this address:0x572309f98e9085f9122fbec9de20a00e19a0476a7cde7e7f84b5a7d168a7520eNoteIf, like me, you\u2019re seeing gas-related errors when trying to run your Truffle migrations, try to edit the gas amount mentioned in the migration.If you want to have a better estimation, head to your Truffle Development testnet terminal and enter eth.getBlock(\"pending\").gasLimit. Use the number returned to resolve the issue.Truffle development testnet Terminal estimating gasLimitCreate a front-endOpen the app folder and edit index.html to resemble this snippet:index.htmlNo real shocker there, I\u2019m assuming everything is clear regarding the HTML file.Edit javascripts/app.js to look like this:javascripts/app.jsI\u2019ve deliberately kept the JavaScript simple. The comments should be sufficient for a basic understanding of what\u2019s happening.and edit stylesheets/app.css to look like this:stylesheets/app.cssAgain, Basic stuff. I assume this is pretty clear.Almost There\u2026If you\u2019d like to see your DApp, go ahead and spin up the front-end:$ truffle compile$ truffle migrate --development --reset $ npm run devYour contract needs to be compiled & deployed to your local development testnet. Make sure to re-compile & re-migrate when you make changes to the Contract. Truffle-webpack will automatically reload your front-end when it detects changes to the contract. Neat!Open http://localhost:8080 and you should see the HTML file showing the Smart Contract balance, and it\u2019s value in USD after a few seconds. The values will update automatically until the Smart Contract runs out of funds. Don\u2019t forget that we need to pay for our Oraclize communication ;).If everything went smooth, you should see your front-end showing the balance of the Smart Contract in ETH and in USD using Oraclize and Solidity Events:Open http://localhost:8080 and you should see the HTML file showing the Oraclize Smart Contract balance, and it\u2019s value in USD. Oraclize uses the Coinbase API to fetch the current ETH/USD spot price and return it to the contract. The front-end values will keep updating until the Smart Contract runs out of funds.Reference ProjectI\u2019ve uploaded a reference project to GitHub in case you run into troubleWWWillems/medium-02-truffle-oraclize-apimedium-02-truffle-oraclize-api - Reference project for an article I wrote on Medium about using Truffle, Oraclize & the\u2026github.comInteresting LinksUnderstanding Oracles (By Oraclize)Setting up an Oracle machine on Amazon\u2019s AWSHow does Oraclize handle the TSLNotary secret?Toolsethereum-bridge repositoryTruffle documentationOraclize documentationSolidity documentationCarbon codesnippetsGanacheOraclize Remix IDEThanks for reading!I\u2019d love to hear from you and learn how you feel about my article.

But it\u2019s not convenient to write the smart contract on the web directly. For learning purpose, writing the code on the web directly is fine. For blogging, writing the article on the web directly is fine. But when you do coding for serious purpose, it\u2019s usually offline. So I\u2019ll show you how to write a smart contract with a normal text editor.Truffle is like a framework to build the smart contract. You don\u2019t have to use Truffle to write the smart contract. But Truffle is to coding a smart contract is like Ruby on Rails to web programming.First, you need NodeJs. Go to its homepage and install the recommended version (at the time of this article is written, the version is 8).NodeJs homepageInstalling NodeJs gives you node and npm programs. Node is something like java, python, ruby programs. It runs the JavaScript application. Npm is the package manager. It is similar to pip, apt-get, gem.Then you need to install Truffle:npm install -g truffleIf you are in MacOSX or Ubuntu Linux, you may need to append sudo in front of the command to get the permission to install truffle command system wide.Truffle homepageWe create a directory and initialize it with Truffle.mkdir Auctioncd Auctiontruffle initInside the directory, you put the smart contract inside the contracts directory.edit contracts/Auction.solYou can replace edit with the command to launch your beloved text editor, such as vim, code, sublime, emacs, or atom.Copy this code to Auction.sol.pragma solidity ^0.4.19;contract Auction {  address public manager;  address public seller;  uint public latestBid;  address public latestBidder;   constructor() public {    manager = msg.sender;  }   function auction(uint bid) public {    latestBid = bid * 1 ether; //1000000000000000000;    seller = msg.sender;  }   function bid() public payable {    require(msg.value > latestBid);     if (latestBidder != 0x0) {      latestBidder.transfer(latestBid);    }    latestBidder = msg.sender;    latestBid = msg.value;  }   function finishAuction() restricted public {    seller.transfer(address(this).balance);  }   modifier restricted() {    require(msg.sender == manager);    _;  }}If you want to know what this code does, check my previous article.You can compile the smart contract by launching this command.truffle compileBy default the output of your compilation process is in build/contracts/Auction.json file. You can open it to see what it is inside. It is a json file. There are two keys of this json object that are very important, which are abi and bytecode.The bytecode is the content that the Ethereum Virtual Machine understands. It\u2019s like the binary file. The abi is the interface so we can interact with the smart contract. So if the bytecode is the house, the abi is the map of the house (where the doors are located).You can not execute this bytecode just like that. It\u2019s different than when you compile the C/C++ code and be able to execute the binary directly. You have to put the smart contract in the blockchain first.For simplicity, you are going to deploy this smart contract to the local blockchain. The way to launch the smart contract to Ethereum main network where real Ethereum lives is similar. But first you launch the local blockchain with Truffle.truffle developTruffle developDid you see by default it launches the service in port 9545 in localhost? Keep that in mind.Before you can deploy your beloved smart contract, you need to tell the Truffle project where to look for the blockchain. Edit the truffle config file.edit truffle.jsCopy this content into that file.module.exports = {  // See <http://truffleframework.com/docs/advanced/configuration>  // to customize your Truffle configuration!  networks: {    \u201cdevelopment\u201d: {      network_id: 2,      host: \u201clocalhost\u201d,      port: 9545    },  }};Then we need to write the migration. To some people who are familiar with frameworks like Ruby on Rails, migration in this case is not like database migration. Here, migration means the process to deploy that particular smart contract.edit migrations/2_deploy_contracts.jsCopy this content to that file.var Auction = artifacts.require(\u201cAuction\u201d);module.exports = function(deployer) {  deployer.deploy(Auction);};Now you can deploy the smart contract. Open a new terminal and go inside the project directory. Don\u2019t disrupt the terminal where you launched truffle develop. We will use it later.truffle migrateYou will get the output like this:Using network \u2018development\u2019.Running migration: 1_initial_migration.js Replacing Migrations\u2026 \u2026 0x3a8f8c4379f1d7269b9d931a088984f4ccfeec797bbb6e128582e2915c8f3ea1 Migrations: 0x8cdaf0cd259887258bc13a92c0a6da92698644c0Saving successful migration to network\u2026 \u2026 0xd7bc86d31bee32fa3988f1c1eabce403a1b5d570340a3a9cdba53a472ee8c956Saving artifacts\u2026Running migration: 2_deploy_contracts.js Replacing Auction\u2026 \u2026 0xf0b10908aeb415b8b13fe60aeed8ade6769679572a44cf679b5616e38670329d Auction: 0x345ca3e014aaf5dca488057592ee47305d9b3e10Saving artifacts\u2026Your output will not be same 100% with mine. The addresses will be different. Take at look at the deployed address. It is important. In my case, the address of deployed Auction smart contract is 0x345ca3e014aaf5dca488057592ee47305d9b3e10.Now, go to Truffle console. It is in the terminal where you launched truffle develop. And take at look at the first public key. Take notice of that.Look at the first accountLet\u2019s find out the manager of this smart contract. Type this in Truffle develop console.Auction.at(\u201c0x345ca3e014aaf5dca488057592ee47305d9b3e10\u201d).manager.call();The random number, 0x345ca3e014aaf5dca488057592ee47305d9b3e10 is from the output of truffle migrate command. The output of this statement you typed just now in Truffle develop console is the first account address that I asked you take notice of. It looks like truffle migrate command will deploy the smart contract with the first account in Truffle develop.Now, let\u2019s execute the auction method but with different account.Auction.at(\u201c0x345ca3e014aaf5dca488057592ee47305d9b3e10\u201d).auction(3, {from: \u201c0x2932b7a2355d6fecc4b5c0b6bd44cc31df247a2e\u201d });You can check the result whether this method works properly or not.truffle(develop)> Auction.at(\u201c0x345ca3e014aaf5dca488057592ee47305d9b3e10\u201d).seller.call();\u20180x2932b7a2355d6fecc4b5c0b6bd44cc31df247a2e\u2019By the way, you can make it simpler by just doing this.truffle(develop)> Auction.at(\u201c0x345ca3e014aaf5dca488057592ee47305d9b3e10\u201d).seller();\u20180x2932b7a2355d6fecc4b5c0b6bd44cc31df247a2e\u2019Now, let\u2019s write unit test for our smart contract. Here\u2019s the bad news. I couldn\u2019t write test successfully inside the Truffle framework. I have to do it manually. It\u2019s either I did it wrong or there is a bug in Truffle framework. Once I figure it out, I\u2019ll write it in future articles. For now, we just have to write the test manually. First install some stuff with npm.npm install --save ganache-cli mocha web3@1.0.0-beta.34This is local installation. It will save these libraries into this project, but not system wide. Ganache is like Truffle develop, a local blockchain for smart contract unit testing. Mocha is unit testing framework. The web3 is the way we connect to the deployed smart contract. Here, the web3 is not version 1.0 production ready yet. The production version is less than version 1.0 but we need version 1.0 because there are some methods we need badly. Hence, we use beta version.Put the test file inside the test directory and name it Auction.test.js.Write these lines.const assert = require(\u2018assert\u2019);const ganache = require(\u2018ganache-cli\u2019);const Web3 = require(\u2018web3\u2019);const web3 = new Web3(ganache.provider());const json = require(\u2018./../build/contracts/Auction.json\u2019);Here, we are importing important stuff from libraries we just installed. assert is to check the whether the method is working properly or not. ganache is our local blockchain. web3 is the way we connect to this local blockchain. json is a the output of the compilation of Auction.sol file.Below that, write these lines.let accounts;let auction;let manager;const interface = json[\u2018abi\u2019];const bytecode = json[\u2018bytecode\u2019];We initialize some variables. As I described above, we only care about two parts of the output json file, the bytecode and the interface (abi).Go on with these lines.beforeEach(async () => {  accounts = await web3.eth.getAccounts();  manager = accounts[0];  auction = await new web3.eth.Contract(interface)      .deploy({ data: bytecode })      .send({ from: manager, gas: \u20181000000\u2019 });});beforeEach in unit testing means you run this method every time you execute a unit test. Connecting to blockchain is a asynchronous process so we have to declare our function async. The first thing we do is to get all accounts. Ganache gives us some accounts to play for. But we need these accounts before we go to other steps so we use await here to make the statement synchronous. We use the first account as manager. Then we deploy the contract. To deploy the contract, we need the interface, the bytecode, the address and some gas (deploying contract is not free).describe(\u2018Auction\u2019, () => {  it(\u2018deploys a contract\u2019, async () => {    const auctionManager = await auction.methods.manager().call();    assert.equal(manager, auctionManager, \u201cThe manager is the one who   launches the smart contract.\u201d);  });  //Continue from this line from now on...});This is our first test. describe is a way of grouping test. The first test is to check the address which deploys the contract is saved to manager variable inside the smart contract. Here, we are interacting with the smart contract with NodeJs not Solidity. Hence, there are some differences of accessing the methods or properties of the smart contract. To access the manager property of the smart contract, you use this statement.auction.methods.manager().call()We continue our other test.it(\u2018auctions the item\u2019, async () => {  seller = accounts[1];  await auction.methods.auction(2).send({ from: seller });  auctionSeller = await auction.methods.seller().call();  assert.equal(auctionSeller, seller,\u201cThe seller is the one who called the auction method.\u201d);  auctionBid = await auction.methods.latestBid().call();  assert.equal(auctionBid, web3.utils.toWei(\u20182\u2019, \u2018ether\u2019),\u201cThe latest bid is the argument sent to auction method converted into wei.\u201d);});Here, in this test, we use different account for seller. To execute the method of the smart contract with a specific address, use this statement:auction.methods.auction(2).send({ from: seller });We continue our journey with other test.it(\u2018bids the item\u2019, async () => {  bidder = accounts[2];  await auction.methods.bid().send({ from: bidder, value: web3.utils.toWei(\u20183\u2019, \u2018ether\u2019) });  auctionBid = await auction.methods.latestBid().call();  assert.equal(auctionBid, web3.utils.toWei(\u20183\u2019, \u2018ether\u2019),\u201cThe latest bid is the payment sent to bid method converted into wei.\u201d);});Here, in this test, we test the sending payment when we execute the method of the smart contract. We use value keyword argument. By default, it accepts wei number. But we are working with ether number so we have to convert it with web3 helper function.auction.methods.bid().send({ from: bidder, value: web3.utils.toWei(\u20183\u2019, \u2018ether\u2019) });We go on with other test.it(\u2018must bid above the latest bid amount\u2019, async () => {  bidder = accounts[2];  try {    await auction.methods.bid().send({ from: bidder, value: web3.utils.toWei(\u20181\u2019, \u2018ether\u2019) });    assert(false);  } catch (err) {    assert(err);  }});Here, in this test, we test the exception thrown when we fail the require statement in the smart contract. Remember this method in the smart contract?function bid() public payable {  require(msg.value > latestBid);   if (latestBidder != 0x0) {    latestBidder.transfer(latestBid);  }  latestBidder = msg.sender;  latestBid = msg.value;}We have to send the payment greater than the last bid. So in this test we want to test the fail case. We use try catch to test the fail case.try {  await auction.methods.bid().send({ from: bidder, value: web3.utils.toWei(\u20181\u2019, \u2018ether\u2019) });  assert(false);} catch (err) {  assert(err);}We continue with the last tests.it(\u2018only manager can finish the auction\u2019, async () => {  nonmanager = accounts[1];  try {    await auction.methods.finishAuction().send({ from: nonmanager });    assert(false);  } catch (err) {    assert(err);  }});it(\u2018finishes the auction as manager\u2019, async () => {  manager = accounts[0];  await auction.methods.finishAuction().send({ from: manager });  assert(true);});The complete test file code is here.const assert = require(\u2018assert\u2019);const ganache = require(\u2018ganache-cli\u2019);const Web3 = require(\u2018web3\u2019);const web3 = new Web3(ganache.provider());const json = require(\u2018./../build/contracts/Auction.json\u2019);let accounts;let auction;let manager;const interface = json[\u2018abi\u2019];const bytecode = json[\u2018bytecode\u2019];beforeEach(async () => {  accounts = await web3.eth.getAccounts();  manager = accounts[0];  auction = await new web3.eth.Contract(interface)      .deploy({ data: bytecode })      .send({ from: manager, gas: \u20181000000\u2019 });});describe(\u2018Auction\u2019, () => {  it(\u2018deploys a contract\u2019, async () => {    const auctionManager = await auction.methods.manager().call();    assert.equal(manager, auctionManager, \u201cThe manager is the one who launched the smart contract.\u201d);  });  it(\u2018auctions the item\u2019, async () => {    seller = accounts[1];    await auction.methods.auction(2).send({ from: seller });    auctionSeller = await auction.methods.seller().call();    assert.equal(auctionSeller, seller, \u201cThe seller is the one who called the auction method.\u201d);    auctionBid = await auction.methods.latestBid().call();    assert.equal(auctionBid, web3.utils.toWei(\u20182\u2019, \u2018ether\u2019), \u201cThe latest bid is the argument sent to auction method converted into wei.\u201d);  });  it(\u2018bids the item\u2019, async () => {    bidder = accounts[2];    await auction.methods.bid().send({ from: bidder, value: web3.utils.toWei(\u20183\u2019, \u2018ether\u2019) });    auctionBid = await auction.methods.latestBid().call();    assert.equal(auctionBid, web3.utils.toWei(\u20183\u2019, \u2018ether\u2019), \u201cThe latest bid is the payment sent to bid method converted into wei.\u201d);  });  it(\u2018must bid above the latest bid amount\u2019, async () => {    bidder = accounts[2];    try {      await auction.methods.bid().send({ from: bidder, value: web3.utils.toWei(\u20181\u2019, \u2018ether\u2019) });      assert(false);    } catch (err) {      assert(err);    }  });  it(\u2018only manager can finish the auction\u2019, async () => {    nonmanager = accounts[1];    try {      await auction.methods.finishAuction().send({ from: nonmanager    });      assert(false);    } catch (err) {      assert(err);    }  });  it(\u2018finishes the auction as manager\u2019, async () => {    manager = accounts[0];    await auction.methods.finishAuction().send({ from: manager });    assert(true);  });});This is how you execute the test.npm run testYou\u2019ll get the output like this.", "responses": 9, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Solidity", "Truffle", "Tutorial", "Web3"]}, {"title": "Verifying your truffle-solidity contracts on Etherscan", "post_link": "https://blog.fundrequest.io/verifying-your-truffle-solidity-contracts-on-etherscan-87cb374e2adc?source=search_post", "author_name": "Quinten De Swaef", "author_link": "https://blog.fundrequest.io/@QuintenDes", "publish_date": "2017-10-12", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-07", "readtime": "3.32", "claps": 485, "voters": 40, "content": "Verifying your truffle-solidity contracts on EtherscanQuinten De SwaefFollowOct 12, 2017 \u00b7 4 min readThis is a quick, 5-minute tutorial on how to verify your solidity contracts, written using truffle, on etherscan.io.Navigate to your contractFirst of all, navigate to your contract on the chain. It can be found at https://etherscan.io/address/YOUR_HASH#codeNavigate to Verify and Publish to go to the correct verification page.We\u2019ll need to add some extra parameters, which can only be enabled by pointing your the url to a different endpoint. Change \u201ccontractVerify\u201d to \u201ccontractVerify2\u201d in your url.Fill in the correct valuesNext up, you\u2019ll need to fill in the correct values in the form. Enter the contract name you wish to verify. Choose the correct compiler. You can find the correct compiler by opening a new terminal and entering the following command.solc \u2014 versionThe result will most likely be a non-nightly build.The correct value for Runs, which is the amount of times the optimization should run, is either 0 or 200, depending on your truffle version. With newer versions, we recommend trying with 200 first.Paste the contents of your contracts in the code box. Keep the code as it was when you deployed it, but remove all the imports, as all code will be in a single file, so importing will not be necessary or supported.Tip: We recommend using this tool to flatten your code. What oracles-combine-solidity does it get your contract code, import every contract your contract uses and flatten it all into one file. It will make your life a lot easier.If you deployed a contract which contained constructor arguments, you\u2019ll need to add them in the following input box. Constructor arguments are expected to be ABI-encoded. More information on ABI-encoding can be found on the page, but remember arguments are _right to left_. An example for one of our projects can be found below.Tip: If you can\u2019t figure out your ABI-encoded constructor arguments, first look at the encoded unlinked binary of your contract, then look at the encoded transaction-arguments of the transaction that created your contract. If your contract was deployed with constructor arguments, they should have been appended to the transaction data. So the difference between the two will be the ABI-encoded constructor arguments.Lastly, you\u2019ll need to add any libraries you\u2019re using. You can find the location of your Libraries in the output of Truffle when you deployed them or in the generated json files.That\u2019s it, hit verify and publish. Your contract should now be verified. Your code should be visible on your contract and methods for reading the state of your contract will be available on the web page.Why verify your contracts?The reason we always verify our contracts is easy. First of all, it generates trust. People can see your contracts and verify the code with what you claim they should be doing.Secondly, it\u2019s darn useful to have an easy go-to page to read the state of your contracts.Get to Know FundRequestWebsite | Sign up | White paper | Progress reportsNever Miss An Update By Following FundRequest\u2019s ChannelsBlog | Telegram | Github | Reddit | TwitterOur partners", "responses": 5, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Solidity", "Development", "Etherscan", "Articles"]}, {"title": "Writing Solidity Unit Tests for Testing Assert(), Require() and Revert() Conditions Using Truffle", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@kscarbrough1/writing-solidity-unit-tests-for-testing-assert-require-and-revert-conditions-using-truffle-2e182d91a40f?source=search_post", "author_name": "Karen Scarbrough", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@kscarbrough1", "publish_date": "2018-01-15", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-10", "readtime": "6.51", "claps": 232, "voters": 42, "content": "Writing Solidity Unit Tests for Testing Assert(), Require() and Revert() Conditions Using TruffleKaren ScarbroughFollowJan 15, 2018 \u00b7 7 min readWriting a share of unit tests using Javascript in Truffle, it started to nag at me that I had not been testing whether or not my contracts were \u201cthrowing\u201d at conditions in which I did not want functions to execute. As Ron Jeffries pointed out, \u201cI am pretty sure there is a difference between \u201cthis has not been proven\u201d and \u201cthis is false.\u201d So, I set on a mission to learn how test \u201cthrows\u201d, or now asserts, requires, and reverts, using Solidity unit tests. There is a well laid out Truffle tutorial for testing throws, and I have to admit the first time I approached it, it was over my head, and I put it to the side. Revisiting the material again, well, practice pays off, and it\u2019s one more very powerful tool to add the arsenal. I haven\u2019t seen a ton out on this subject yet, so I figured it couldn\u2019t hurt to write supplemental piece on how I learned my way through these Solidity tests. If you feel thrown off, put it down, learn some more advanced methods in Solidity contract design and come back \u2014 because what contract couldn\u2019t use a little more testing?Review of Assert(), Require(), and Revert()First, let\u2019s go over how assert(), require(), and revert() work as throw has been deprecated after Solidity Compiler Version 0.4.13 \u2014 at the time of writing we are currently on version 0.4.19.In writing functions in Solidity for your smart contracts, one of your first lines of defense against things such as malicious parties, bad input data, and wasted gas expenses is through the use assert(), require() and revert(). Much of the below is from the documents, but for a quick overview\u2026Assert() should only be used to test for internal errors and to check invariants. Recall that an invariant is something that is assumed to be true during execution. A great example of the use assert() is OpenZeppelin\u2019s SafeMath.sol . Here, in the add() function assert() is used to confirm that any summed integers do not overflow. This add() function is used internally and in a \u201cnormal\u201d reality this condition should never be reach as we assume the addition of two numbers should result in their respective sum. If the assert() condition evaluates to false, then all gas is consumed and state conditions are rolled back \u2014 like it\u2019s predecessor throw.Require() should be used to ensure valid conditions (inputs) or contract state variables are met or to validate return calls to external contracts. I think of require() as guarding against transactions that you would not want to execute although the function would allow it if require() was omitted. For example, you might require() that the transaction be initiated from a certain address or require() that a transaction only be allowed to execute prior to a certain time. From a beginner perspective, one of the most important lessons in learning Solidity is how and when to use require() as you shape the appropriate and secure user inputs. Unlike throw, with require(), any remaining gas is returned to the sender, yet similar to throw, state conditions are rolled back as well.Revert() is similar to require() but can be used to flag an error. I am looking forward to the days of revert() as we will be able to include error messages when the conditions are met. More information here.Writing the TestsLet\u2019s take a simple example of a storage contract as below. Here, we start out storing the number 24. Using the function storeNum(), we only want to store numbers above 10.To get our bearings straight, let\u2019s go over how a Solidity test is put together.First, we want to import the below:import \"truffle/Assert.sol\"import \"truffle/DeployedAddresses.sol\"import \"../contracts/MyContract.sol\"Where are Assert.sol and DeployedAddresses.sol? When I first saw these, I thought I had to dig through my files in Truffle to find them because I was sure that, it couldn\u2019t be so easy as for me to import them via simply \u201ctruffle/xyz.sol.\u201d However, it is that easy. From Tim Coulter\u2019s, creator of Truffle, answer here, you can see that \u201cDeployedAddresses.sol\u201d is created dynamically at the time of deployment . From what I can tell, \u201cAssert.sol\u201d does exist within your Truffle does exist deep within your Truffle files, but you can pull it into your testing this way as well. And what exactly are these two files? Assert.sol is a library contract that holds functions for all Solidity tests, such as isFalse() or isEqual(). These are largely similar to the ChaiJS assertions in your Javascript tests, but they are executed through a Solidity contract instead. You can see the full details of available tests in Assert.sol here. Again looking back to Coulter\u2019s answer, \u201cDeployedAddresses.sol\u201d is a contract that maintains your contract\u2019s deployments and allows you to access them.Moving forward, it is important to recognize that your Solidity tests must begin with \u201cTest\u201d \u2014 uppercase \u201cT\u201d, to identify it in Truffle as a test. Likewise, all Solidity test functions must also begin with \u201ctest.\u201dLet\u2019s begin with an easy Solidity test case:When we run truffle test, we see the test passed. As expected, our initial value of mynumber is 24 as laid out in MyContract.sol. And Ganache was busy:Eight transactions. What all was going on? Digging in, we can see block 1 was a contract creation. Block 2 was a contract call. Block 3 another contract creation. Block 4 another contract call. Block 5 a contract creation. Block 6 another contract creation. Block 7 even another contract creation. And block 8 a contract call. Overall, that\u2019s 5 total contracts created: let\u2019s count we should have TestMyContract.sol, Assert.sol, DeployedAddresses.sol, and MyContract.sol \u2014 so what is the extra contract? Pay attention to your console, and you can see that Solidity unit tests make use of your default Migrations.sol for contract deployment as well. That is our \u201cextra\u201d contract.Now that we have a Solidity test completed, let\u2019s see how we can test our ultimate goal \u2014 assert(), require(), and revert(). Truffle tutorials suggest using a proxy contract \u201cto wrap the contract call to a raw call and return whether it succeeded or not.\u201d What does that exactly mean? First, let\u2019s take a look at some full code for testing throws.You can see from the above that we now have a ThrowProxy contract included in our TestMyContract.sol. What is this doing? Going step by step is easiest, first upon creation, we can see that ThrowProxy is storing the address of it\u2019s target. The target of which is the contract that we would like to test for throws. This coincides with the first two lines of testTheThrow() function as you can see we first create a new MyContract and then feed that address into ThrowProxy.Alright, so next you can see that the in fall back function ofThrowProxy that the message data is stored as datain the ThrowProxy contract. Recall that the message data is the complete call data of a contract call \u2014 and what does that mean? The identifying function signature and the inputs compressed into 32 bytes. A function signature is the first four bytes of the hash of the canonical signature string. In our contract, MyContract, we have a function storeNum with a uint mynum as a input, it\u2019s canonical signature string would be storeNum(uint256), and if it took a string input as well then storeNum(uint256, string). To get the function signature, you can use sha3() or keccak256() to get the hash of which you take the first four bytes for the function signature. Further, the message data combines the input data with the function signature as well.After the fallback function, we can see that execute() uses the address of the original contract, target, in this case, MyContract to execute .call() using the message data collected from the original fallback function. This is quite brilliant as now execute() returns a boolean true/false if target.call(data) was successfully executed or not \u2014 recall that .call() returns a boolean. It does not provide any other returns of function execution. Furthermore, this means if a throw condition was encountered viatarget.call(data) , then the contract would not be able to execute and would return false \u2014 instead of breaking our tests as in JavaScript, we can simply carry on to the next test.Returning the example, in testTheThrow() we see on line 10 that we call MyContract(address(throwProxy)).storeNum(7) , so we are sending a transaction to our throwProxy but throwProxy does not have a function called storeNum()? In this case, throwProxy will execute the fallback function, thus storing the message data for a call using the storeNum() function! On the following line, when we run throwProxy.execute.gas(200000)(), we are in fact calling our original storeNum() on MyContract. After storing the true/false result as r, we can use a function from our Assert.sol library to test whether or not a throw condition was encountered. In our example, since our contract is not supposed to store numbers less than 10, a throw condition will be encountered. So, our result r should be false, and the test will pass \u2014 allowing us to test our next conditions.Now, we have a basis for testing assert(), require() and revert() in a Truffle test environment. The next test testNoThrow() works in exactly the same way as our testTheThrow(), preparing our call data throw the proxy contract and using call() to see whether or not a function completed execution. There is a lot more to Solidity tests to be expanded upon than just testing for throws \u2014 they even allow for Before/After Hooks. In a larger test set, we would certainly want to separate out our throwProxy into its own individual contract, and use more aggressive methods to test our code.I published all code from my examples here if you would like to run the complete set with Truffle.Thanks for reading.

Split into three categories: Fresh, New and Popular.A special section in the app \u201cBookmarks\u201d displays a list of user\u2019s favorite shows which are currently stored on the Blockchain.Users are able to add or remove shows from their Bookmarks section. Every time a user adds or removes a show a Smart Contract function is invoked and the change is stored on the Blockchain.The front-end app is a server side rendering React app powered by Next.js, for state management we\u2019ll use MobX, styling and layout will come from the awesome tachyons project and in order to interact with the Blockchain we\u2019ll write a Smart Contact in solidity, write tests for it in JavaScript and deploy it locally using truffle.In the previous post, we went over the implementation of our Smart Contract that acts as our app backend logic and storage. In this post we\u2019ll focus on building the UI using React and how we can invoke actions on our Smart Contract from within the browser.In more details in this post I\u2019ll go over:Setting up The Development EnvironmentWriting our Backend APIWriting our React componentWriting our MobX store to handle app state changes.Writing our BlockChain service that will invoke our Smart Contract public APIs.Setting up The Development EnvironmentMake sure you have node, git and nvm install before starting this.First we need to install TestRpc and Truffle:npm install -g ethereumjs-testrpcnpm install -g truffleNow clone the app and install the dependencies://clone the repogit clone git@github.com:liors/tvdapp.git// Navigate to within the directorycd tvdapp//install dependenciesyarn install//start the development serveryarn devIn a new terminal window start a local Blockchain network:testrpcNow we need to compile and migrate our Smart Contract run:yarn run blockchainOnce you run all the above commends you can open your browser at http://localhost:3020/tv/fresh and see a local version of the app.Our Backend APINext.js comes with default express configuration. In some cases that\u2019s fine, in our case I wanted to add routes to our API requests so I\u2019ve used a custom express server.Under /server you can find two files index.js and api.jsLet\u2019s go over index.jsOur API has 3 end-points:/api/shows/new/api/shows/popular/api/shows/freshAll of them uses the same api.get function we exports from api.js. In addition we alias some get requests to our main /tv/fresh route, so when a user visits / or /tv we redirect him to our /tv/fresh page. All other requests i.e., \u2018*\u2019 will be handle by next.js default route.The last part of our backend code is fetching the content from rotten tomatoes and enrich the return data with images coming from tvmaze.Let\u2019s go over api.jsWe export a get function that receives a type. We then making a request and map the result over to generate an array of titles and urls.IMO tvmaze provides better quality images, so let\u2019s enrich our API by getting for each show an array of images.Async/await syntax helps us avoid nested callbacks and hopefully to create a more readable and\u00a0clean\u00a0code.Our get function returns a Promise that includes an array of JSON objects, each includes a title and an img object.Our React componentsNext.js provides a very simple routes API. You only need to create a pages folder and each file under this folder will become the main react component rendered for this route. For example /pages/index.js will be your app homepage i.e., the default route /.In our case the main page route is under /pages/tv/fresh.jsNext.js also provides a way to fetch data on both server and client by introducing a new life cycle function called getInitialProps. When implementing it we must return a Promise that resolves to a JavaScript object, which then populates the component\u2019s props.We start by invoking our API \u2014 /api/tv/fresh and initiating our store with the result shows. The function then return our component props: shows and if we are rendering the results on the server or not.Our render function is quite simple \u2014 we simply render a Page component and pass it two props: type and store.All our pages/routes look very similar, the differences are the page type and store which contains the relevant shows for the given type.Let\u2019s look at our Page component.This component uses two additional components \u2014 our app navigation and the grid of shows. The selected page is the current prop type. Our render function is wrapped with a MobX provider as this is our main component of the app.This component has another responsibility. Only when running on the client i.e., in React\u2019s componentDidMount function we setup our web3 instance, once this is done we make a request to our Smart Contract to get the already bookmarked shows. Once this request is resolved we update our store which cause our app to be re-rendered if needed.Lets looks at our main UI component shows.jsOur render function uses a `square title subtitle` layout from tachyons.io. In order for our app to recognize these css classes (for example cf, w-100, pa2-ns etc) we need to include tachyons css file.Next.js provides a way to customize the main html that is being generated by the server by creating a _document.js which let you return a chunk of html that includes a head tag.In our cases we\u2019ll set the viewport and include some external resources we use \u2014 font, css files and the web3 library.<Head>   <meta charSet='utf-8' />   <meta name='viewport' content='initial-scale=1.0, width=device-width' />   <link href='//fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto' rel=\"stylesheet\" />   <link href='//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/tachyons/4.8.1/tachyons.min.css' rel='stylesheet' />   <link href='//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/nprogress/0.2.0/nprogress.min.css' rel='stylesheet' />   <script src='/static/js/web3.min.js'></script></Head>Back to our shows component \u2014 once we render our shows we need to display a different SVG for shows that are already bookmarked vs those that are not. We do that by looking at our bookmarked shows array in our store:isBookmarked = show => some(this.props.store.bookmarkedShows, show)some is a lodash function that checks if predicate in this case identity returns truthy for any element of collection in our case our list of shows.Now we need to implement the Bookmark action. We do that by wrapping the title/subtitle/bookmark SVG elements w/ an anchor tag and define an onClick function on it:handleBookmark = show => this.props.store.bookmark(show)Our last react component is the Notification component that gives to the user an indication that a show is added/removed from the Blockchain, you can find it under /components/notification.jsOur MobX store to handle app state changesAs we saw in our components implementation we do not have anythis.setState()calls to re-render our components or fetch requests to get/change data. Our MobX store handle this for us and provide us w/ the core APIs our UI needs.Our store supports the following actions:bookmark \u2014 this acts as a toggle for bookmark/remove action to our UI.setBookmarkShows \u2014 this set the initial bookmark shows coming from the Blockchain.hideBookmarkNotification \u2014 this help hiding our notification component once needed.Let\u2019s look in more details at our bookmark function.We first check if the provided show is already bookmarked \u2014 if not we use our blockChainService\u2019s bookmarkContract function. As an argument this function gets a JSON that represents the show to bookmark\u2014 this JSON will be then stored on the Blockchain.Once the request is resolved we add the show to our observable shows array, turn on the notification flag and set the proper type of action \u2014 this will help the notification component to display the proper text.To remove/reject an already bookmarked show we call rejectBookmarkContract and filter out the show from our observable shows array.Our BlockChain service that invokes our Smart Contract public APIsWe got to the last part of our app, the service that uses ethereum\u2019s web3 to invoke remote function on our Smart Contract. Let\u2019s look how the service getBookmarks is implemented:let getBookmarks = function () {   return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {      let instance      getBookmarkInstance()         .then(result => ({instance} = result))         .then(() => instance.getBookmarks.call())         .then(bookmarks => {            resolve(bookmarks && JSON.parse(bookmarks.toString()))         })      })}In order to invoke any Smart Contract function, we need to get the available web3 instance. We do that by importing our BookmarkArtifact and the contract function from truffle-contractimport BookmarkArtifact from '../build/contracts/Bookmark'import contract from 'truffle-contract'Then we provide the contract function our artifact and set it\u2019s Provider to the current web3 instance current provider.const Bookmark = contract(BookmarkArtifact)Bookmark.setProvider(web3Instance.currentProvider)Once we did that we can get the accounts and return the deployed instance for the first one.web3Instance.eth.getAccounts((error, accounts) => {   const account = accounts[0]   Bookmark.deployed().then((instance) => {      resolve({ instance, account })   })})Ok, so back to out getBookmarks function. Once we have an instance we can invoke our Smart Contract public APIs. In this case we need to get our bookmark shows i.e., call getBookmarksinstance.getBookmarks.call()   .then(bookmarks => {      resolve(bookmarks && JSON.parse(bookmarks.toString()))   })The result will be a string that we parse and transform into a JSON object.Bookmarking a show looks very similar. We first get an instance and then call our bookmark function, in this case we need to provide some addition information \u2014 from which account this action happens.instance.bookmark(JSON.stringify(blockchainBookmarks), { from: account })    .then(showId => instance.getBookmarks.call())    .then(bookmarks => {        resolve({ data: JSON.parse(bookmarks.toString()) })    })That\u2019s it our app is complete.To summarize, we\u2019ve been using React, Next.js, MobX and truffle to build a server side rendering React DApp. I hope you can take this simple setup to start your own development on top of the Blockchain.The complete code is available on github, if you like it please start the repo!A live version of the app is deployed here \u2014 Please make sure your browser can run DApps, I\u2019ve been using MetaMask chrome extension.Thanks for reading.

In this tutorial, we take a closer look at building the test infrastructure to support time-sensitive tests for smart contracts using Solidity, Ganache, and Truffle.download theThere is an excellent Medium article by Andy Watt about testing on the Ethereum blockchain which provides useful insights and helper functions. Given that a contract cannot be overwritten, it is vital that code \u201cexecute correctly on the blockchain,\u201d as a bug can cost notable money and resources \u2014 see, for instance, The DAO Hack, Parity Wallet Bug.The following illuminates a bit of experience on writing tests and building off Andy\u2019s findings. In particular, this explores testing time-dependent code along with methods and tooling that may not be widely known. These methods can help the developer community write more robust contracts and more isolated tests, hopefully allowing us to collectively avoid having similar hacks to The DAO and Parity Wallet Bug.VersionsTruffle v5.0.5 (core: 5.0.5)Solidity v0.5.0 (solc-js)Node v11.10.0Ganache CLI v6.3.0 (ganache-core: 2.4.0)Setting the TimeThe first feature to cover is setting the start time within ganache-cli, which was added in October 2018 and a part of the 6.2.0 release. Take a look:ganache-cli \u2014 help\u2026 -t, \u2014 time Date (ISO 8601) that the first block should start. Use this feature, along with the evm_increaseTime method to test time-dependent code.

Below is an example TimeContract along with tests to demonstrate this. The repo is located here.The first test asserts current time is after Sun Feb 10, 2019 00:00:00 UTC.The second test asserts current time is after Wed Mar 20, 2019 00:00:00 UTC.Test OutputStart up the ganache client by setting the current time to Fri Feb 15, 2019 15:53:00 UTC.$ ganache-cli --time 2019-02-15T15:53:00+00:00Here is the output of the tests:$ truffle testCompiling ./contracts/Migrations.sol\u2026Compiling ./contracts/TimeContract.sol\u2026Contract: TimeContract \u2713 Sun Feb 10 00:00:00 UTC 2019 (before current time) \u2713 Wed Mar 20 00:00:00 UTC 2019 (after current time)2 passing (181ms)Here it can be seen that indeed the assertions from above hold true.Jumping Through TimeThe second feature to discuss is jumping through time.There are JSON RPC API methods within the ganache EVM that allow the simulation of time events:Methods+-----------------------------+-----------------------------+|           Action            |      Ganache EVM Name       |+-----------------------------+-----------------------------+| Advance the time            | evm_increaseTime            || Advance the block(s)        | evm_mine                    || Advance both time and block | evm_increaseTime + evm_mine || Save time                   | evm_snapshot                || Revert time                 | evm_revert                  |+-----------------------------+-----------------------------+These methods open up a world of control. Read more about the ones implemented in ganache-cli here.Take a look at the snippet below that wraps the above methods in testing helper methods:The snippet is an expansion of Andy Watt\u2019s code from the Medium article mentioned at the beginning of this article with the addition of two new methods.Jumping ForwardTo move forward in time call advanceTimeAndBlock(<time>) or advanceTime(<time>) with the number of seconds (<time>) desired to advance. These methods use JSON RPC evm_increaseTime and evm_mine methods.For example to move forward 10 days, use the utils.js file in the following way://86400 seconds in a dayadvancement = 86400 * 10 // 10 Daysawait helper.advanceTimeAndBlock(advancement)Below is the updated test code:Here, the last test moves the time forward and asserts that \u2018now\u2019 is after instance_2\u2019s date.Here is the test in action:$ truffle testCompiling ./contracts/Migrations.sol\u2026Compiling ./contracts/TimeContract.sol\u2026Contract: TimeContract \u2713 Sun Feb 10 00:00:00 UTC 2019 (before current time) (39ms) \u2713 Wed Mar 20 00:00:00 UTC 2019 (after current time) \u2713 Wed Mar 20 00:00:00 UTC 2019 (after current time) (48ms)3 passing (249ms)It can be seen that the assertions hold true.However, if the tests are run again, one of the tests fails:$ truffle testCompiling ./contracts/Migrations.sol...Compiling ./contracts/TimeContract.sol...

The local blockchain kept record of the advancement in time and remains at +100 days from our start date. Therefore, the next time the tests are run, they will fail because the second test run\u2019s start date will begin from the prior test run\u2019s end date. In order for these tests to successfully run again, the ganache-cli needs to be restarted using the --time flag with the initial date provided above: 2019-02-15T15:53:00+00:00.Jumping BackwardWhen jumping backward, it is necessary to first capture the current time as to know where to jump backwards to. This is what the takeSnapshot() and revertToSnapshot(id) methods do. These methods use JSON RPC evm_snapshot and evm_revert methods.For example to take a snapshot and capture the ID use the utils.js file in the following way:snapShot = await helper.takeSnapshot()snapshotId = snapShot[\u2018result\u2019]To revert the snapshot using the captured ID use:await helper.revertToSnapshot(snapshotId)Below is the updated test code:This ensures that before running any test, the ID is saved. After each test, revert is called with the ID to move back to the state prior to running the test.The output is not different from the output in \u2018Jumping Forward\u2019, but the test can be repeatedly run without failure.In reviewing the output of ganache-cli note the EVM commands as it saves, moves forward, and moves backward in time.evm_snapshotSaved snapshot #2evm_increaseTimeevm_mineeth_getBlockByNumbereth_getBlockByNumbereth_getBlockByNumbernet_versioneth_callevm_revertReverting to snapshot #2ConclusionBy introducing the functionality to manipulate time, it is possible to test time-dependent code in an isolated manner. Introducing statelessness ensures idempotence among test runs, thereby making test development for the blockchain significantly easier. Hopefully the demonstrations here are useful and empower the community to write safer and more robust contracts. If you have any questions or comments, please share them below; collaboration is welcome and encouraged at Fluidity.DisclosuresPlease be aware that hopping forward and backward in time is not possible on the mainnet; these examples are for testing purposes only.It is important to note that, regarding jumping backward, Truffle\u2019s framework already does this with their \u2018Clean-room environment\u2019 when using \u201ccontract() instead of describe().\u201d So, while the above examples show you can hop forward and backward, it is possible to simplify test writing by using Truffle\u2019s built in functionality for jumping backward.It is also worth noting in the above code examples the time granularity is one day and that doing this on a minute level may not work; Ethereum block times are approximate, ranging from 10\u201319 seconds (can be higher/lower). Both the core Solidity documentation as well as Consensys Diligence recommend not relying on the exact timestamp, \u201c\u2026because not every year equals 365 days and not even every day has 24 hours because of leap seconds\u201d per the Solidity docs.CodeTime Contract Example CodeGanache Time Traveler Utils Code (Star it!)Use the npm package (Use it!)More about FluiditySubscribe to the Fluidity BlogFollow Fluidity on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and YouTube", "responses": 2, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Factora", "Solidity", "Testing", "Truffle"]}, {"title": "Interacting with Deployed Ethereum Contracts in Truffle", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@blockchain101/interacting-with-deployed-ethereum-contracts-in-truffle-39d7c7040455?source=search_post", "author_name": "Bernard Peh", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@blockchain101", "publish_date": "2018-04-15", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-08", "readtime": "3.67", "claps": 204, "voters": 36, "content": "Interacting with Deployed Ethereum Contracts in TruffleBernard PehFollowApr 15, 2018 \u00b7 4 min readThe best way to query a deployed ethereum contract is via the web3.js library and the ethereum wiki has very good documentation on it.Web3 talks to the Ethereum node via RPC calls. However, most Ethereum developers (including myself) are more familiar with the truffle framework which abstracts our interaction with the web3 library. To get an instance of a deployed contract in truffle, we tend to do this:var myContract = artifacts.require(\"MyContract\");myContract.deployed()The code above will return the deployed MyContract promise object for us to work with. To appreciate what is going on, Truffle has done a lot of heavy lifting for us by allowing us to use the truffle-artifacts library which is itself a wrapper around the truffle-contract library which in turns wraps around the web3.js library. Hence, we are actually interacting with web3.js from a very high level. The artifact is a json representation of the contract from the \u201ctruffle compile\u201d command. We can usually see all our contracts in json format under the \u201c/build/contracts/\u201d folder and they follow the truffle-contract-schema standard closely.\u201cmyContract.deployed()\u201d returns an instance of the deployed promise MyContract object, meaning that the deployed address is known and recorded in the json file already. This is not a problem if the contract is deployed from the local machine. What if we want to query a deployed contract not deployed by us?For example, 0x10d4b24938f6de7ae4048c7273f09c50d5caf4d contains a smart contract of a certification registry in the main net. To find out the number of certified students, we would query getCertifiedStudentsCount(). However, Etherscan does a good job of making us lazy by telling us the answer if we read the contract.For users who prefers Myetherwallet.com,So 56 certified students in the contract at the time of writing - No development work needed.It\u2019s all good until what want to call getCertifiedStudentsCount() in our script to do more advance things. Something so simple suddenly requires a few more ingredients. Here are the challenges:We run a dummy testnet for development most of the time. Now we need to access the main net, what\u2019s the best way to do it without downloading the the entire chain?Ans: Thanks to infura.io, they have allowed everyone to query their Ethereum node and we no longer need to download gigs of data to run a live node just to talk to the main net.2. We will need the deployed contract\u2019s abi to be able to access the contract\u2019s function. Where do we get the abi?Ans: If the contract source code is available, then the abi can be retrieved easily in etherscan (if published) or by running truffle compile . If the source code is not available, then we need to try to get the abi from the bytecode by decompiling it. A good tool for this use case would be Mythril.3. If getCertifiedStudentsCount() is payable and it requires someone to pay some ethereum in order view the results, then our call need to be connected to a wallet and need to spend some ether when calling the function.Ans: We could create a new account in a simple HD wallet like metamask, then use the 12-word mnemonic phrase as inputs to sign the transaction when making the call. truffle-hdwallet-provider is a good library for this use case.How do we do all these without leaving truffle?In truffle.js, we created different environments so that we could switch between them easily when needed. Note that we have used dotenv library as well so that we could store our infura credentials in the .env file instead.require('dotenv').config();var HDWalletProvider = require(\"truffle-hdwallet-provider\");module.exports = {  networks: {    development: {      host: \"localhost\",      port: 8545,      network_id: \"*\", // Match any network id      gas: 4700000    },    ropsten: {      provider: function() {        return new HDWalletProvider(process.env.INFURA_ROPSTEN_MNEMONIC, \"https://ropsten.infura.io/\"+process.env.INFURA_KEY)      },      network_id: \"3\"    },    main: {      provider: function() {        return new HDWalletProvider(process.env.INFURA_MAINNET_MNEMONIC, \"https://mainnet.infura.io/\"+process.env.INFURA_KEY)      },      network_id: \"1\"    }  },  solc: {    optimizer: {      enabled: true,      runs: 200    }  }};We now need to create CertificationDb.json so that we could interact with it as an artifact. In build/contracts/CertificationDb.json, we add the following information:{  \"contractName\": \"CertificationDb\",  \"abi\": [{\"constant\":true,\"inputs\": ...}]}The contract abi could be copied from etherscan. I have left out the full abi here for the sake of simplicity.Next, let us start the query in query.js.var contract = artifacts.require(\"CertificationDB\");var contract_address = '0x10d4b24938f6de7ae4048c7273f09c50d5caf4d9';module.exports = function() {  async function getCertifiedStudentsCount() {    let ins = await contract.at(contract_address);    let res = await ins.getCertifiedStudentsCount();    console.log('no. of passed students is '+res.toString());  }  getCertifiedStudentsCount();}To test that everything is working, we run the truffle exec command.> truffle exec query.js --network mainUsing network 'main'.no. of certified students: 56Cool, I got the answer I want. The source code for this article can be found in my repo.Finally, for users who want to stick to web3,var contract_address = '0x10d4b24938f6de7ae4048c7273f09c50d5caf4d9';module.exports = function() {  // If using web3 straight away, we need the abi  var abi = [{\"constant\":true,\"inputs\":...];  // web3.eth.contract(abi).at(contract_address) is the  magic line to get the contract object.  let contract = web3.eth.contract(abi).at(contract_address);  contract.getCertifiedStudentsCount((err, res)=>{    console.log('no. of certified students: '+res.toString());  });}Have fun.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Solidity", "Web3"]}, {"title": "Truffle Tricks for Ethereum Development: Dispelling 8 Myths & First Impressions", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@timothyjcoulter/truffle-tricks-for-ethereum-development-dispelling-8-myths-first-impressions-880f66bf3320?source=search_post", "author_name": "Tim Coulter", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@timothyjcoulter", "publish_date": "2015-09-22", "last_modified_date": "2018-05-10", "readtime": "3.83", "claps": 72, "voters": 38, "content": "Truffle Tricks for Ethereum Development: Dispelling 8 Myths & First ImpressionsTim CoulterFollowSep 22, 2015 \u00b7 4 min readIf you haven\u2019t heard of Truffle, go get it. It\u2019s a tool that makes developing Ethereum projects much easier. When people first interact with Truffle, they think they\u2019re confined to fitting into the structure first provided, having a very rare scope that supports only specific types of projects. I\u2019m here to dispel that myth \u2014 and many others \u2014 and show you some Truffle tricks you didn\u2019t know were possible.Myth #1: You must use the folders provided to you in the `app` directoryWhen you run `truffle init` and you\u2019re given an app directory with \u201cjavascripts\u201d, \u201cstylesheets\u201d and \u201cimages\u201d within it, you might think you have to use those directories to take advantage of Truffle\u2019s build process. You don\u2019t. You can delete those folders, add new ones, or rename them to your heart\u2019s content. Here\u2019s an example build configuration where files have been renamed (notice no images directory):Directory structure: /app \u2014 pages \u2014 controls \u2014 vendorApp configuration:{  \u201cbuild\u201d: {    \"app.js\": [      \"vendor/react.js\",       // structure is up to you      \"controls/button.js\",      \"pages/page_one.jsx\",       \"pages/page_two.jsx\"     ]  },  // ...}Myth #2: Dependencies must live in the app directoryPaths are relative to the app directory, but that doesn\u2019t mean dependencies have to live there. Here\u2019s an example where the build process refers to dependencies that exist outside of \u201capp\u201d, allowing you to take advantage of package managers like npm:{  \u201cbuild\u201d: {    \"app.js\": [      \"../node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js\",      // ...    ]  },  // ...}Myth #3: Truffle can only build web appsFalse. Here\u2019s a great example of Truffle building a library, creating both a distributable and minified version.Myth #4: Truffle can\u2019t have multiple dependent build targetsOh but it can. Taken from the same example as Myth #3, you can use build targets as they\u2019re created, since each build target within app.json is created in order:{  \u201cbuild\u201d: {     // The main library file.     \u201chooked-web3-provider.js\u201d: \u201chooked-web3-provider.es6\u201d,     // Note, the first one will be processed before this one,     // so we can refer to the built file.     \u201chooked-web3-provider.min.js\u201d: {       \u201cfiles\u201d: [         \u201c../build/hooked-web3-provider.js\u201d       ],       \u201cpost-process\u201d: [         \u201cuglify\u201d       ]     }  },  // ...}Myth #5: Like it or not, you must use Truffle\u2019s build processNope \u2014 this is perhaps the biggest myth. Just delete the \u201cbuild\u201d configuration from your app.json if you need something more complex (or don\u2019t want a build process at all). You can still use Truffle for contract compilation, testing and deployment.Myth #6: Contract code requires lots of copy pastaThis isn\u2019t so much a myth it is a lesser-known feature we added to Truffle. Solidity\u2019s import statement leaves much to be desired, so we wrote our own. If you want to include one contract as a dependency of another, simply import it in the order you want it included; Truffle will take care of the rest.import \"Permissioned\"; // Looks for ./contracts/Permissioned.solcontract MyContract is Permissioned {  // ..}You can even import nested contract files:import \"tools/Hammer\"; // Looks for ./contracts/tools/Hammer.solAnd viola! Mangeable, maintainable code separation, sans pasta.Myth #7: Truffle doesn\u2019t support different blockchains like development vs. staging vs. production, or a testnet vs. Olympic vs. Frontier)Au contraire. Truffle has the concept of environments \u2014 pulled from Rails \u2014 that you can use to configure different blockchains and contracts deployed to those blockchains. By default you\u2019re given development, staging, production and test, but they\u2019re not required. If you don\u2019t need one, just delete it and Truffle will respond accordingly. If you want to make your environments more tailored to you, then rename them. Here\u2019s an example file structure with environment names tailored to the context the app will be deployed to:Directory structure:/config \u2014 development \u2014 consensys-testnet \u2014 ethereum-mainnet - app.jsonEach of the directories within `config` should contain a `config.json` file that at minimum defines the network they connect to. You can also use this config file to overwrite the default configuration of any value within `app.json`:{  \"rpc\": {    \"host\": \"xx.xx.xx.xx\",     \"port\": \"1234\"  }}Once in place, you can build your application as well as compile and deploy your contracts to use the environments you\u2019ve specified:// Both compile and deploy will write a contracts.json file to the// environment specified:$ truffle compile -e consensys-testnet $ truffle deploy -e consensys-testnet// Building will hook up the contracts in the specified environment// to the frontend for use. If you keep the production environment,// `truffle dist` will create a `dist` folder you can commit to// your respository.$ truffle build -e consensys-testnet$ truffle dist                                        Myth #8: Truffle doesn\u2019t support complex deployment processesTruffle hasn\u2019t taken a stance on the ideal contract deployment process, so you won\u2019t see any advanced deployment options if you take a deep dive into the code. But complex deployment processes are possible, and can easily be scripted with `truffle exec`. Truffle\u2019s `exec` command lets you run a Node script within the environment you specify (details below), interacting with your contracts the same way you would when writing your frontend or your tests.Here\u2019s an example script that can be run after `truffle deploy` that hooks up an AppStore contract with an AppFactory:File Name: register_factories.js-----------------------------------------------------var store = AppStore.at(AppStore.deployed_address);store.registerFactory(\u201capp\u201d, AppFactory.deployed_address).then(function(tx) {  console.log(\u201cRegistered AppFactory successfully.\u201d);  process.exit(0)}).catch(function(e) {  console.log(e);  process.exit(1);});To run this script, simply run the following. In this example, `truffle exec` will use the contracts that were already deployed to the \u201cconsensys-testnet\u201d environment created above:$ truffle exec ./register_factories.js -e consensys-testnetFin.Truffle is still being actively developed, and has a ways to go before it solves all development and deployment problems in the young Ethereum Frontier. However, through the tricks above we hope you can get one step closer to a manageable, maintainable project.

Due to the properties of the blockchain representing application state, this results in \u201capplications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third party interference\u201d.Is Ethereum similar to Bitcoin?Well. sort of, but not really. The similarity is there in the sense that both use the blockchain, but that\u2019s where it ends. As Ethereum is not just a digital currency But It provides a platform to develop blockchain-based applications which features smart contracts, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and uses its currency called ether for peer-to-peer contracts.What is a smart contractA smart contract is a computer code running on top of a blockchain containing a set of rules under which the parties to that smart contract agree to interact with each other. If and when the pre-defined rules are met, the agreement is automatically enforced. The platform on which it\u2019s executed gives this piece of code some properties such as immutability, deterministic operation, distributed & verifiable state, etc. The state managed by this code is stored, immutable, on a blockchain and anyone can double check that the current state is correct by replaying all of the transactions from the beginning of the chain.EVM \u2014 The Ethereum Virtual MachineEVM (or Ethereum virtual machine) is the Ethereum smart contracts byte-code execution environment. Every node in the network runs EVM. All the nodes execute all the transactions that point to smart contracts using EVM, so every node does the same calculations and stores the same values. Moreover, the EVM ensures programs do not have access to each other\u2019s state, ensuring communication can be established without any potential interference.Web3 & Technology StackAs we all know in the early \u201990s the World Wide Web (WWW) revolutionized the information. Since then, the Internet became only more mature & programmable and we saw the rise of the so-called Web2, which brought us social media and e-commerce platforms, revolutionizing social interactions, bringing producers and consumers of information, goods, and services closer together, and allowed us to enjoy P2P interactions on a global scale. But there was always a middleman: a platform acting as a trusted intermediary between A and B who did not know or trust each other. While these platforms have done an amazing job at creating a P2P economy, with an ever more sophisticated content discovery layer, they also dictate all rules of the transactions, and these platforms own all of our data.In this context, Blockchain seems to be a driving force of the next generation Internet, the Decentralized Web, or Web3 and gives rise to Decentralized Web Stack.Similar to building a normal web or mobile applications, creating a dApp (Decentralized Application) commonly requires a few things: computation, file storage, external data, monetization, and payments as depicted below.Web 3.0 Abstracted StackAs we would be progressing towards decentralized systems, this does not mean that we will get rid of centralized systems altogether. It seems to transition from client-server internet to the decentralized web will be gradual rather than radical. As the decentralized web stack is still maturing, the transition seems to be shifting from centralized to partially decentralized to fully decentralized.The shift from Centralized to Fully Decentralized AppsDeveloping a DApp. How to access Ethereum.An attempt to explain Ethereum from a developer\u2019s point of view.Current client-server webapp architecture at a very high levelCurrent Client Server Application ArchitectureThe web application is hosted on a hosting provider like AWS, Heroku or any other VPS. The client interacts with this one central application. Clients can be a browser, widget, curl command or other API consuming services. When a client makes a request via a web browser to the server, the server code implemented interacts with the database and/or cache for CRUD operation and serves the client.This is how an Ethereum Dapp looks like at a high level:Futuristic Decentralized Application ArchitectureIf one observes every client (browser) communicates with its own instance of the application. There is no central server to which all clients connect to. This means every person who wants to interact with a dapp (Decentralized Application) will need a full copy of the blockchain running on their computer/phone etc. That means, before you can use an application, you have to download the entire blockchain and then start using the application. This might sound ridiculous at first but it has the advantage of not relying on a single central server which might disappear tomorrow.Getting StartedBasic Dapp using Metamask, Truffle & GanacheBasic tools we need -Node Package Manager (npm) \u2014 NPM is a package manager for Node.js packages or modules.Ganache \u2014 Ganache (earlier TestRPC) is a personal blockchain for Ethereum development that developers can use to deploy contracts, develop applications, and run tests. It runs 100% locally and simulates a full Ethereum client but is much much faster making it ideal for testing and development. It comes in two flavor \u2014 Ganache (GUI) & Ganache-CLI.Truffle \u2014 Truffle is a development environment, testing framework, and asset pipeline for blockchains using the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Basically, it helps you deploy your contracts to the blockchain, swap old contracts for new ones (called a migration), and hook your front-end up to your deployed contractsMetaMask \u2014 MetaMask is an Ethereum light client and Chrome extension that lets users interact with the blockchain without downloading the whole blockchain. In other words, it allows you to interact with dApps in an ordinary Chrome browserFirst, we need to install our tools. Lets first install npm if you don\u2019t have one. Here are instructions on how to install it.Once npm is installed, we can use it to install ganache-cli, a Node.js Ethereum client that mimics a real Ethereum node.$ npm install -g ganache-cliNext, we need to install truffle$ npm install -g truffleand the last one, MetaMask Chrome plugin which you can find here.Start Ganache-CLI$ ganache-cliThis will start up the client and generate 10 accounts for you to use, each with 100 ETH.

Open MetaMask and follow the initial setup steps.Once MetaMask is set up, select the network menu in the upper-left. Then select \u201cLocalhost 8545\u201d as your network as shown below.Metamask connected to GanacheNext, add a couple of accounts to MetaMask by going to the colored circle at the right top -> Import Account, and then copying in a private key from the list printed out in your terminal when you started Ganache-CLI. In my case it is \u2014 0xc8763205e691a0e9f75c70a33c6f03d74a3eb4f5eabb3cc2df2e1418f5ae009a.Account 2 is from Ganache-CLIAs shown above, we can see the account 2 which is nothing but the first account displayed in the terminal after running ganache-cli.Our environment is now set up, and we are ready to create and deploy our dApp. Let\u2019s start by creating a new project directory and unbox the Truffle dApp with Webpack integrated. I\u2019m going to call my project ethereumdapp, but you can call yours whatever you\u2019d like.Initialize Truffle$ mkdir ethereumdapp$ cd ethereumdapp$ truffle unbox webpackDeploying Contracts and Running dAppTo deploy your contracts to ganache-cli run the following command:$ truffle compile$ truffle migrateOnce the migration is complete we can run our dApp. To run the dApp$ cd app$ npm run devOpen http://localhost:8080/ in the browserWe should see our dApp running and ready to use! If we switch the current MetaMask account to the first account generated by Ganache-CLI and refresh the page we should see balance is 10,000 META. Now we can send META to other accounts using the dApp interface.To check the transactions locally, we may install etherparty explorerInstall etherpartyAs we have already installed node and npm, the only thing to install is git. Here are the steps to install it. Once git is installed, Open a terminal and type the following$ git clone https://github.com/etherparty/explorerThis will clone the etherparty explorer to local directory explorer. Change to this directory$ cd explorernow let's start the explorer$ npm start> EthereumExplorer@0.1.0 start /Users/XXXX/explorer> http-server ./app -a localhost -p 8000 -c-1Starting up http-server, serving ./app on port: 8000Hit CTRL-C to stop the serverNavigate to http://localhost:8000/. You will see something like below.Now let's transfer some Metacoin (10 Metacoin) from ganache-cli account(Account 2) to metamask account(Account 1).Once the transaction is initiated, Metamask will show a notification like belowOn confirming the transaction, We can see Metacoin debited from account 2 and credited to account 1.Account 2Account 1We can validate the transaction in explorer also as shown below. Block#6 is the block created for this transaction.The complete code can be found here. In Part-2, we will create a simple notarized smart contract and showed both the ways to deploy it using the web3js library with Ganache-CLI and Truffle with Ganache-CLI.Please share your thoughts, feedback, comments, and clarifications.

If you have written a few smart contracts chances are you\u2019ve used it or at least tried it out, but there are a few things which constantly pop up when writing test files for contracts which I find myself repeating. I\u2019ve compiled a few of the most useful snippets that I use consistently when writing tests, maybe they will be useful to someone else too.Deploying Contracts/** *  Deploys a contract with given constructor parameters; if the  *  final param is an object it is treated as the intended *  transaction object *  @param contract Contract to deploy (from artifacts.require()) *  @optional @param ...args Additional arguments, passed as general  *  comma separated args to contract.new() *  @return newContract Deployed contract instance */deploy: async (contract, ...args) => {  let txObj = _.last(args)  if (!_.isObject(txObj)) {    txObj = { from: web3.eth.accounts[0] }    args.push(txObj)  }  let newContract = await contract.new(...args)  return newContract},Often times I find myself needing to deploy a few different contracts within my tests, but the lines can be somewhat verbose. Using this little method, it\u2019s really easy to deploy multiple different contract types using the same interface:let MyContract = artifacts.require('./MyContract.sol')utils.deploy(MyContract, param1, ..., { from: someSender, ... })VM Exceptions (throw, revert(), require(), out of gas etc.)/** *  Assert that a particular Ethereum transaction throws *  @param promise Transaction operation which should throw *  @param err Error message which should be printed upon test  *  failure *  @return Promise which will resolve once the transaction has been *  completed (can be used with await) */assertThrows: (promise, err) => {  return promise.then(() => {    assert.isNotOk(true, err)  }).catch((e) => {    assert.include(e.message, 'VM Exception')  })},This isn\u2019t the most bulletproof method for checking for a VM Exception, I\u2019m sure. But it\u2019s the most reliable one that I have come across so far. I think at one point TestRPC changed its error message string, throwing off a bunch of tests, so be warned.Usage: await utils.assertThrows(myContract.someOperation(1)) . If your contract execution fails, the test will move on past this line, if it succeeds, you\u2019ll get a test failure from the assert in the catch handler.NOTE: This won\u2019t work if you\u2019re testing against a real network, only TestRPC. Bear that in mind.Time-based Contract Testing/** *  Increases the time in the EVM. Cannot be undone at the moment *  which is a bit of a pain. *  @param seconds Number of seconds to increase the time by */increaseTime: async (seconds) => {  await web3.currentProvider.send({    jsonrpc: '2.0',    method: 'evm_increaseTime',    params: [seconds],    id: Number(Math.random() * 1000).toFixed(0)  })  await utils.mineOneBlock() // optional (*)}If you have any logic in a contract which relies on block.timestamp, you\u2019ll probably want to test that without having to make a separate (non-production-version) contract to test out that little piece of logic. Luckily TestRPC allows you to increase the blocktime on it\u2019s VM by using evm_increaseTime . Unfortunately you can\u2019t roll this back yet, so you might either have to use relative dates/times in your tests or spin up some small helper which kills and restarts TestRPC after a test of this nature (so far I\u2019ve never found that necessary though).Also note the optional last line in this function, which might be necessary if your TestRPC\u2019s blocktime is 0 (no auto-mining). If you check the blocktime immediately after calling this function, it won\u2019t have changed, so you\u2019ll need to skip ahead a block for the new time to be incorporated. If you\u2019re wondering what mineOneBlock looks like, it\u2019s down below.Mining a Block/** *  Sends a request to the RPC provider to mine a single block *  synchronously */mineOneBlock: async () => {  await web3.currentProvider.send({    jsonrpc: '2.0',    method: 'evm_mine',    id: new Date().getTime()  })},Fairly self-explanatory, it tells TestRPC to mine a block for you :-)Addendum: Waiting for Events/** *  Resolves when a given event happens, or rejects after an *  optional timeout *  @param event Contract event to watch for *  @param optTimeout Optional time to wait in milliseconds (useful *  for long blocktimes) *  @return Promise which resolves when the event is seen */waitForEvent: async (event, optTimeout) => {  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {    let timeout = setTimeout(() => {      clearTimeout(timeout)      return reject(new Error('Timeout waiting for event'))    }, optTimeout || 5000)    event.watch((e, res) => {      clearTimeout(timeout)      if (e) return reject(e)      resolve(res)    })  })}This one is a little less clear than the others IMO, and again I don\u2019t think it\u2019s bulletproof (your network might respond too fast or something) but I think it\u2019s good enough to start with. Essentially you\u2019re going to trigger the event from your test asynchronously, then wait for the event (or lack thereof, it\u2019s quite simple to make an inverted version of this function which ensures that no event was logged). Ensure that you don\u2019t await on the function which is triggering the event, otherwise it will have already been logged by the time our helper starts watching for it, and we\u2019ll always get a timeout.let myEvent = myContract.MyEvent()myContract.triggerMyEvent() // note lack of await here, important!let result = await utils.waitForEvent(myEvent) // no event = failureHope these are helpful, if you think you\u2019ll use any, I\u2019ve compiled them into an NPM module here.

This has a lot of advantages in that it allows for a wide range of people available to work on your project; but it can also make it difficult to get to know your coworkers.I started Truffle in early 2015 as the sole developer, and it stayed that way for nearly a year and half. John McDowell joined in late 2016, and by the time of the retreat we happily brought Nick D\u2019Andrea and Josh Quintal on board. All interviews happened over Skype.I live in Yakima, Washington. John lives in Victoria, British Columbia. Nick lives in Philadelphia, and Josh lives in Detroit. That\u2019s a lot of distance between us.When we brought Nick and Josh onto the team, it became obvious that we needed to meet up in person to solidify our roles, define responsibilities, and establish our own culture before growing the team even larger.And we wanted to hang out in the woods, at the top of a mountain, and get to know each other.The LocationWe had our retreat near Victoria, BC where John lives. Nick, Josh and I traveled all day through a series of planes, ferries and car rides to finally arrive at the house around 7 pm. The house sits atop a large hill in Braemer Heights overlooking all of Victoria, and on a good day has a beautiful view of Mt. Baker in the States.The house was the definition of excess for a team of four, especially with only three of us sleeping there. It had five bedrooms and four bathrooms; a deck with a grill; three stories, the topmost containing only an office with 360-degree windows; and loads of wildlife. Unexpectedly, it was only ten minutes away from a Costco, which helped immensely. Even more unexpectedly, this mansion cost us less than three hotel rooms and a coworking space.The WorkI had a few specific goals for our retreat: to define everyone\u2019s roles and responsibilities within our team, to define our product roadmap for the next six months, and to create a mission statement for Truffle that our whole team could rally behind.RetrospectiveWe started with a retro. We wanted to evaluate where we were as a team before deciding where we wanted to go in the future.So on Tuesday morning, we sat down and gave praise for what we\u2019ve done well and identified areas where we could improve. I brought a list of business areas that are important for Truffle \u2014 things like development, technical leadership, branding, marketing, etc. \u2014 and we graded ourselves on each of them.This turned out to be an interesting exercise. As the leader of the team you want to say \u201cwe\u2019re doing great\u201d, and not diminish anyone\u2019s efforts \u2014 because, it\u2019s true, we\u2019ve come far for a small team. However, we need to know where we can improve and how different areas of our company, teamwork and products stack up to the rest. In general, we all seemed to agree on the results: Branding and growth have been stellar (e.g., we have a good product that people like to use), but more external communication \u2014 like our technical leadership, our relationship with the Ethereum Foundation, and relationships with some of our VIP users \u2014 could use some improvement. Though these results were mostly subjective judgements, the conversations that resulted helped inform discussions about our roles and future roadmap.Roles & ResponsibilitiesThe Truffle team had already doubled in size in 2017, and right before the retreat two new team members \u2014 Ben Burns and Mike Pumphrey \u2014 had accepted offers (welcome!). So we knew we had some work to do regarding defining our roles and how we work together as a team.Before the retreat, I had met separately with Nick, Josh, and John to evaluate how they felt about their current roles at Truffle. We each talked about what they wanted to do both within the team and professionally, and how I could help them get there. Then we used this time at the retreat to reorganize the work so that it aligns with each team member\u2019s personal goals as well as the group\u2019s goals. We created a new org chart and chain of command, including the new team members we knew were coming on.We decided that Josh and John would share design responsibilities for our website, logo design and general aesthetics for all of our products. Ben, who started in October, would take on the internals of the TestRPC (now Ganache) and related products ensuring we stay up to date with the Ethereum ecosystem. And Mike would be coming on board to wrangle all of our documentation and learning content, eventually molding it into tailored courses we\u2019d offer to individuals and businesses.That just left Nick and I. Though we both knew Nick would work on the internals of Truffle when he was hired, we didn\u2019t know the extent of the work required; in addition to improving Truffle, Nick would be burdened with the arduous task of softly and lovingly ripping my baby from my arms. That is, Truffle\u2019s my baby, and I\u2019ve been nurturing it from day one. In order to build a more functional and growing team, it became clear I\u2019d have to let go of the internal implementation details and focus more on our business and our product, leaving Nick to explore the tool\u2019s technical way forward.This transition has been a great growing experience already, both professionally and personally. We\u2019ll continue to evaluate this structure over the next six months to see how it works out.Mission StatementThe next step was to determine why we\u2019re here. The big three questions were: Why are you here? What do you value? And what do you stand for? The point was to elicit each team member\u2019s value systems to get a big picture of what it is we really care about.My original plan for this session was to put each person on the spot and ask them those questions directly. As it turns out, this interrogation technique was not the best way to get meaningful, genuine answers from the team.Luckily, John came up with a better plan. He suggested we have each member of the team write their values on six index cards, and then have the whole team talk about each other\u2019s values, create a big list, and vote on them to determine our company values.The conversation helped us all understand how different we were, and how much our values varied. We expressed everything from receiving good pay to building the distributed ecosystem.In the end, we all agreed why we\u2019re here. Our new mission statement:Truffle builds useful tools for the next generation of blockchain technologies. We enable the growth of the Ethereum and open source communities, help to improve the role of decentralization in society, and empower developers to achieve their goals.Product RoadmapOn Thursday, we got into the details of what we\u2019ve been working on at Truffle and where we\u2019re going. This included presentations for new products [SPOILER ALERT!] and discussions about specific features. We\u2019ve been hard at work since we drafted this post, so some you may have heard of already:Truffle 4.0! \u2014 with a debugger, improved development and testing experience, and more!Ganache \u2014 a personal blockchain for developers.Drizzle \u2014 a frontend framework for React and Angular to easily connect Truffle-based projects.Hotcakes \u2014 a full stack suite for web applications.Live \u2014 a browser-based, interactive Truffle IDE.We also talked about revamping our development processes, which included not only how we work together as well as beefing up our continuous integration systems and making it very easy for users to contribute to Truffle projects. Stay tuned for more info!The FunIn the middle of all of this work we wanted to get some bonding time in too. And if you haven\u2019t been to Victoria, it really is gorgeous, and we couldn\u2019t let this trip go to waste.So on Wednesday we got in John\u2019s Honda Element and drove for two hours to Port Renfrew. The hike on paper: beach hike, sun, potentially bears, great outdoorsy time. The hike in reality:We didn\u2019t see any bears, and we got completely rained out of the hike. But, we also took our first Truffle team selfie:And eventually when the rain cleared got this cloudy-but-serene view from the dock at Port Renfrew.And when we got back to the house, we made dinner, played board games, and drank a bunch of wine.So overall, we had some successful bonding time.Going HomeBeing able to all be in the same room for the first time ever was extremely rewarding. It gave us a great foundation for the future of our working relationships and of Truffle as a whole, and increased our personal relationships in a way you don\u2019t get when working 100% remotely. We\u2019ll definitely be making retreats a recurring part of working at Truffle.Now that we\u2019re all back to work as usual, we\u2019ve already taken the results of the retreat to heart. We\u2019ve implemented our new development processes (info to come soon); revamped our products and offerings to be more in line with each other; have been settling into our new roles amazingly, and with little conflict; and overall we\u2019ve been having a great time.There are a few things I want to make sure I remember coming out of this retreat:You can build more of a relationship with someone in 10 minutes in person than you can in 3 months on Slack. I want to maintain this momentum and rapport. We\u2019ve found that video calls are the closest you can get on a 100% remote team. Going forward, we\u2019re now having one-on-one meetings every week to make sure we can keep up our rapport and ensure we\u2019re giving each other consistent, useful feedback.The right processes and structures are the basis for responsibility, autonomy, and trust between teammates. During the retreat we collectively decided on rules and structure that would help us work better together. These rules were meant to increase responsibility and autonomy and provide a basis of trust in decision-making where each of us are responsible for our own individual specialties. I want to increase this trust and know that each team member can make the right decisions when needed.Building rapport with your teammates is worth the effort. In a remote team you don\u2019t often get the chance to invite your coworker over for dinner or go to a local event. Bridging this gap is hard, and requires conscious effort, but has so many benefits including happiness, morale and general enthusiasm toward coming into work every day. I want to continue to bridge this gap and foster a culture where even if we\u2019re a thousand miles away, we can still feel close enough to have each other over for dinner.Final thought: I\u2019d eat Nick\u2019s caprese salad and Josh\u2019s sirloin medallions any day of the week.Like this piece?

And we were able to write tests to assert that our smart contract works the way we want it to, also interact with it via the truffle console. If you have not checked it out yet, you probably should.This tutorial is a second part where we would build a clean interface using React together with Truffle Contract ,web3js and Bulma for UI, that a user visiting our application can use to interact with the smart contract on the blockchain.What Will I Learn?In the second part of this tutorial, you will learn how to:Build standard Dapps interfaces using ReactArchitecting And Workflow for easily building an interface for Dapps, built with truffleUsing Truffle Contract in combination with Web3 to interact with our contract on the blockchainRequirementsFor this tutorial, it\u2019s required for you to clone the repository from the previous tutorial, although it\u2019s not a requirement to read the first tutorial before you jump right into this one, as each tutorial address two different aspects of building an Ethereum Dapps and therefore can be considered self-contained.Clone the token-zender smart contract https://github.com/slim12kg/tokenzendr-contractTrufflesuite installed installation guide hereGanache installed private blockchain serverMetamask installed install for chrome,firefox,operanpx installed (npx comes with with npm 5.2+)Basic knowledge of ReactThis tutorial assumes you are using a UNIX operating systemDifficultyIntermediateTutorial ContentsTo start with, create a new react appnpx create-react-app token-zendrRemeber ealier we mention we will be using web3js, bulma & truffle contract. Now is the time to install them, to do so replace your project package.json with what you see below, then run npm install{    \"name\": \"token-zendr\",    \"version\": \"0.1.0\",    \"private\": true,    \"dependencies\": {    \"bulma-start\": \"0.0.2\",    \"react\": \"^16.4.2\",    \"react-dom\": \"^16.4.2\",    \"react-scripts\": \"1.1.4\",    \"truffle-contract\": \"^3.0.6\",    \"web3-js\": \"^1.0.5-beta.26\"    },    \"scripts\": {    \"start\": \"react-scripts start\",    \"build\": \"react-scripts build\",    \"test\": \"react-scripts test --env=jsdom\",    \"eject\": \"react-scripts eject\"    }  }After successfull installation of the packages, fire up your app with npm start, your default browser will automatically fire up a new tab with the default react screen showing. Leave the tab open.Before we proceed forward i need you to clone the smart contract that handles the transfer and deploy it on a your private blockchain (Ganache).Note : Ganache must have been started on your machine before you run the following commandsgit clone https://github.com/slim12kg/tokenzendr-contract.gitcd tokenzendr-contractnpm installtruffle consoletruffle(development)> compiletruffle(development)> migrateIf you open your Ganache, you should see the transactions mined and new blocks created similar to the images below8 Blocks MinedTransactions Log Showing Contract Creation & CallOne of the challenges, developers new to building ethereum Dapps faces is to have to always edit the address of the contract in their code anytime the contract is redeployed. To solve the issue, my approach is to create a soft link of the build directory in the token tokenzendr-contract to the src directory of our new project.This ensures that anytime the contract is redeployed we will be referencing the updated contract address. Genuis !!From your command line run this command, substituiting your project path in the command as it applies to your project//Remember to substituite your project path as it applies to youln -s ~/Desktop/Dapps/tokenzendr-contract/build/ ~/Desktop/Dapps/token-zendr/src!If your screenshot looks like what we have above then you should carry on with the tutorial, else check that you specified the correct directory path and have substituited correctly the directory path that applies to you.As a autonomous smart developer, we want to only support to transfer some vetted tokens or maybe the token creator will have to pay us to support the transfer of their token on our platform. The smart contract already have a method to add or remove supported tokens, but on our frontend we want to also do the same thing, but this time just list them in a json file with the token address, name, symbol, decimal.Looking back on the smart contract we deployed to our private blockchain, one important thing to realise is that we did not only deploy the smart contract that handles the token transfer but also two ERC20 tokens (BearToken, CubToken) contract that we will be using for testing purpose in this tutorial. We will be transfering them between two addresses in our wallet which will be connected to the same same network they were deployed to.Now that i\u2019ve mentioned about two token been deployed alongside our transfer contract, you need to connect your metamask to custom RPC. Click on mainnet a dropdown will drop with the available option to select custom RPC, click this option and enter the address http://127.0.0.1:7545 for new RPC.Enter new RPC URLSee the first address same as the one in Ganache show up with the same balanceWhen the two tokens contract was deployed, it assigns all the total token supply to the address that was used to deploy the contract, in our own case the first account. We want the token balances to show in our wallet, this way you see your balance history as you make transfers, to do this simply open the contract directory of the build folder we created soft link for ealier, you would see files BearToken.json and CubToken.json files. Under the networks section copy the address (contact address) value and add them as new tokens to metamask....\"networks\": {    \"5777\": {    \"events\": {},    \"links\": {},    \"address\": \"0x8f0483125fcb9aaaefa9209d8e9d7b9c8b9fb90f\",    \"transactionHash\": \"0x2a3fd7782a1a7b5c4b388f639e949cac29ca9d51ed0343be91eb8b0b110c8f81\"    }  },...We will begin by start writing our react components. This tutorial is a not beginners post therefore we won\u2019t be coding all from scratch as this will obviously take a longer time. Instead i will pick at each component at a time and mention the role each play while relating it to the App.js file.Oh, one quick addition to the setup process, create a Tokens directory in the src directory of the project, add three files all.js, Bear.js and Cub.js. The Bear.jsand Cub.jswill carry the information of the each tokens such as the address, decimal, name, symbol, icon and most importantly the abi and this will be the process of adding a new supported token. You can get the address, decimal and abi from the json file of each tokens in the build directory, usually on mainnet you can always get this information from etherscan.ioFinally create icons folder in the public folder and add the cub and bear token icons. You can find them here https://github.com/slim12kg/token-zendr-react-interface/tree/master/public/iconsIn actual sense, the ABI (Application Baniary Interface) will contain much more information than displayed below.export default {    address: \"0x8f0483125fcb9aaaefa9209d8e9d7b9c8b9fb90f\",    decimal: 5,    name: \"BearToken\",    symbol: \"Bear\",    icon: \"bear_x28.png\",    abi: [       {          \"constant\": true,          \"inputs\": [],          \"name\": \"name\",          \"outputs\": [              {                  \"name\": \"\",                  \"type\": \"string\"               }          ],         ...,       \"name\": \"Transfer\",        \"type\": \"event\"        }       ] }Create a Components folder in the src directory, add the following components//InstallMetamask.jsimport React from 'react';    function InstallMetamask() {    return (   <div className=\"modal is-active\">       <div className=\"modal-background\"></div>       <div className=\"modal-content\">           <p className=\"image download-metamask\">               <a href=\"https://metamask.io/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">               <img src=\"https://metamask.io/img/metamask.png\" alt=\"\"></img>             </a>           </p>       </div>       <button className=\"modal-close is-large\" aria-label=\"close\"></button>   </div>   )}    export default InstallMetamask;This is a notification component that shows up when a user doesn\u2019t have metamask installed.//UnlcokMetaMask.jsimport React from 'react';    function UnlockMetamask(props) {    return (       <div className=\"column is-4 is-offset-4\">           <div className=\"notification is-danger\">               <button className=\"delete\"></button>               {props.message}           </div>       </div>   )}    export default UnlockMetamask;This is also a notification component that displays a warning if the user metamask account is locked.//Nav.jsimport React, { Component } from 'react';    class Nav extends Component {        render(){            return (               <nav className=\"navbar is-link\" aria-label=\"main navigation\">                   <div className=\"navbar-brand\">                       <a className=\"navbar-item\" href=\"/\">                           <strong><i className=\"fa fa-coins\"></i> {this.props.appName}</strong>                       </a>                                             <a role=\"button\" className=\"navbar-burger\" aria-label=\"menu\" aria-expanded=\"false\">                           <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span>                           <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span>                           <span aria-hidden=\"true\"></span>                       </a>                   </div>                   <div className=\"navbar-menu\">                       <div className=\"navbar-end\">                           <a className=\"navbar-item\">                               <div className=\"tags has-addons\">                                   <span className=\"tag\">                                   <i className=\"fa fa-signal\"></i> &nbsp; Network                                                                  </span>                                   <span className=\"tag is-danger\">{this.props.network}</span>                               </div>                           </a>                       </div>                   </div>               </nav>           )      } }    export default Nav;This component purpose is to serve as our application nav.

Simply replace your index.js with thisimport React from 'react';  import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';  import App from './App';  import '.././node_modules/bulma-start/css/main.css'  import './app.css';      ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));Run npm start or refresh the application if its already opened. When i do so the first screen am presented with because my metamask account is locked is this screenshot below.Then i enter my metamask password, refresh the application and Voila!!Interact with the application and see what else you can add.

a beginners guide to the Truffle Framework \u2014 Part 4Hugh KnightFollowSep 2, 2017 \u00b7 8 min readThere are challenges when reading a technical article or blog, but on the other side of the chain (see what I did there), I find that one of the hardest part for the writer is trying to decide when and how to introduce particular pieces and ideas.Most times, we try to talk about creating an interface as soon as possible. I\u2019m not going to lie, it\u2019s exciting to see the visual results of code, and it makes it feel like you\u2019re making quick progress.But I\u2019ve gone ahead and taken this away from you by doing all that, let me tell you why:Sometimes you get so caught up with trying to make the front end look exactly like you want it that you focus less on the back-end.If we talk about the front-end too much, we may lose track of what we are really trying to accomplish, with a lot of \u201cwouldn\u2019t it be cool if I added this input box, or made this fade, etc\u201d.With that being said, we\u2019ll start by creating and managing a contract within our project. I know this isn\u2019t going to be a mind blowing topic, but if we can just slow it down a bit and get a little bit of an understanding, it will help in building out a strong understanding of Dapps for the future.SolidityOne of the main features of the scoreboard Dapp is the list of players. Without those names showing in the interface, we can\u2019t really do much. I would say that this is a good place to start. Right now the Dapp is just pulling from a static JSON file, which leaves us 2 things to consider:1. Where do we really want to store the data associated with each player?2. How can we then display this information in place of the JSON data within our scoreboard interfaceWe\u2019ll be answering the second question in the later posts, but when it comes to the first question: \u201cWhere do we really want to store the data associated with each player?\u201dThe right answer would be \u201con the ethereum blockchain\u201d, using a smart contract.To be specific, we\u2019re going to create a struct, which will contain each type of data used to define a player.My Note to You: What is a struct exactly? \u2014 A struct is a data type used for representing entities that have multiple attributes of potentially different types.For example:struct Dog {   string name;   string breed;   string color;   uint age;}To do this lets open create a file in the \u201ccontracts\u201d folder and name it \u201cUsers.sol\u201d.Everyone has their own style of programming, so by no means do you have to do the same thing that I do. But what I usually do before I start programming, is to just create a simple framework inside the file of what I want to accomplish.Now let\u2019s go down the list and hash out the rest of the code//define our versionpragma solidity ^0.4.15;//initialize our contract (don\u2019t forget the closing curly brace)contract Users {}//Create our user structstruct Participant {        uint id;        bytes32 name;        uint point;    }//define our stat variablesParticipant[] public users;uint userCount;//add new usersfunction addUser(bytes32 userName, uint userPoint) returns (uint userID, bool success) {    userID = userCount++;        Participant memory newUser;    newUser.id = userID;    newUser.name = userName;    newUser.point = userPoint;        users.push(newUser);    return(userID, true);}//get a list of usersfunction getUsers() constant returns (uint[], bytes32[], uint[]) {    uint length = users.length;        uint[] memory usersID = new uint[](length);    bytes32[] memory userNames = new bytes32[](length);    uint[] memory userPoints = new uint[](length);        for (uint i = 0; i < users.length; i++) {        Participant memory showUser;        showUser = users[i];                usersID[i] = showUser.id;        userNames[i] = showUser.name;        userPoints[i] = showUser.point;    }    return(usersID, userNames, userPoints);}// change the point total for userfunction plusFive(uint id) returns (bool success) {    users[id].point = users[id].point + 5;    return true;}Your code should look something like thisMy Note to You: In solidity a function cannot return a struct, so you have to return an array of an array.Strings can be any length, and this is an issue in solidity, so we have to change the strings into a fixed length using bytes32. So by changing it to hexadecimal we ensure that we don\u2019t cause any issues in solidity.Compile and MigrateNow that we\u2019ve written our contract, lets tap truffle back in to help us compile, migrate and then deploy our contract to the testrpc blockchain so that we can interact with it.The first thing that we want to do after saving our User.sol file is to let truffle know what file to deploy in our migration. Navigate to the migration directory. In there you\u2019ll see the first file which is \u201c1_inital_migration.js\u201d, this file handles the contract \u201cMigrations.sol\u201d, that observes other contract migrations. We can leave this one alone, and create a new file called, \u201c2_deploy_contract.js\u201d to help us deploy our Users contract.To achieve this, let\u2019s enter the following:var Users = artifacts.require(\"./Users.sol\");module.exports = function(deployer) {    deployer.deploy(Users);};Here we\u2019re telling truffle which contract(s) we are interacting with by using the \u201cartifacts.require()\u201d method.We export our function using the module.exports.The \u201cdeployer.deploy()\u201d helps us stage our deployment tasks.Now that we\u2019ve told truffle what we want to do, we can run the migrate command and then the compile command inside the command prompt terminal.Inside the terminal, run the following:truffle compileThis is the command that we use to compile our contracts. We should have an output similar to this:truffle compile outputThen run the following command in your command prompt:truffle migrateYou should see the following output:truffle migration outputIf you receive and error message about not being able to connect to the ethereum client, that just means that your testrpc isn\u2019t running. If you\u2019ve stopped it in the other command prompt window, start it again using \u201ctestrpc\u201d command, and then try running \u201ctruffle migrate\u201d again.Interacting with DataWhen we want to interact with our deployments in truffle we use the truffle console. We can access this by running the following command in the terminal:truffle consoleSo there are 2 things that we are looking for when we connect our backend (contract) to our front end in a Dapp.The deployed contract must have an abi.It also has an address to where it is located on the blockchain.So let\u2019s go ahead and verify both, to ensure we can move one. To check for you contracts abi, run the following inside the truffle console:Users.abiUsers.abi output in truffleWhat we\u2019ve done is told truffle that in our \u201cUsers\u201d deployment, show us the \u201cabi\u201d information.Let\u2019s pull up our contract information by writing the following the truffle console:Users.addressUsers.address output in truffleYours will be different than mine, but Congratulations! You\u2019ve just deployed your first contract to the blockchain (test) using Truffles. Take a minute, that\u2019s a huge step!Times up! I know what you really want to see, so let\u2019s dive in a little deeper.Finding DataThis is going to be fast and furious, so let\u2019s get some users in data in and then let\u2019s query it in the console. Working in the console can get a little verbose. So I would have a look at this link to read up on why it\u2019s done this way: Changes from truffle 2 to 3To add some user data into the contract, write the following command in the truffle console:Users.deployed().then(function(instance){instance.addUser(\"john\", 26)})You\u2019ll get a return of \u201cundefined\u201d. Now let\u2019s search for the user, there are 2 ways to do it. We can using our \u201cusers\u201d array, which asks for the userID or we can call our getUsers() function, which will display all users.We can start with the users array. We know that since that was our first entry that the user would be assigned a userID of 0. In the truffle console, write the following:Users.deployed().then(function(instance){return instance.users(0);})users(0) function outputNow if you want to get a list of the users, using the getUsers() function, write the following:Users.deployed().then(function(instance){return instance.getUsers();})getUsers() function outputLet me go over what we see and why and then we\u2019ll end this one here.The first line \u201cstring 0\u201d, is actually our userID.That second line is actually our user name, but being displayed as bytes (I know\u2026we\u2019ll make it more readable when we connect it to our front end. But if you want to verify, here is a link to a online hex to string converter. Just copy and paste that long line of digits inside the single quote and you\u2019ll see)The third is the point that we entered for the userI think this is actually a really good place conclude this weeks post and pick it up in the next post of this series.Final WordsWhat have we learnt?The back-end of any true Dapp is actually stored on the blockchain and connects to a front-end or User Interface.A struct is a data type used for representing entities that have multiple attributes of potentially different types.When building a Dapp strings can be any length, and this is an issue in solidity, so we have to change the strings into a fixed length using bytes32.A successfully migrated contract should provide you with an \u201cABI\u201d and the contracts address in truffle.Although slightly verbose, you can interact with your contract in truffle using the \u201ctruffle console\u201d command.If you want to get a deeper understandingTray creating a function that changes the userNameUsing the truffle console, see what other things you can see.To see the code in its current state, check out the updated branch post4 in the Scoreboard GitHub commit.Join the conversation, follow us on Twitter: @Tap_Coin, Reddit, or swing by and have a chat with us on Telegram: https://t.co/eIP47QmZ1E to discuss all things Tap Project.Fueled by gamers, inspired by the community, disruptive to all", "responses": 4, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Development", "Blockchain", "Dapps"]}, {"title": "Debugging Smart Contracts with Truffle Debugger: A Practical Approach", "post_link": "https://medium.com/hackernoon/debugging-smart-contracts-with-truffle-debugger-a-practical-approach-f56bf0600736?source=search_post", "author_name": "Mayowa Tudonu", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@mayowatudonu", "publish_date": "2018-11-05", "last_modified_date": "2019-05-07", "readtime": "12.7", "claps": 85, "voters": 27, "content": "Debugging Smart Contracts with Truffle Debugger: A Practical ApproachMayowa TudonuFollowNov 5, 2018 \u00b7 13 min readGiven enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow. ~ Linus\u2019 LawBugs! Bugs are aliens that creep into a programmer\u2019s code at night when no one is watching and alter the state of a working code. These aliens have only one mission \u2014 to frustrate the life of a programmer. How does a programmer kill a bug before he dies of frustration? Yeah, you got it right! By debugging and removing the buggy code. But why would a programmer go into a debugging war without the right tools? If a programmer is going to debug he better do it the right way, using the right tools.If debugging is the process of removing software bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in. ~ Edsger DijkstraIn smart contract development, like traditional centralized software development, bugs creep into the smart contract developer\u2019s code during the development lifecycle of the smart contract. While there are \u2018Etherillion\u2019 reasons why smart contracts could be buggy, one thing remains important, all bugs must be removed before the smart contract is deployed on the mainnet, or else, we risk losing funds and ultimately, the credibility of the smart contract.There are several frameworks for developing smart contracts in solidity. In this article, the focus is on the Truffle Framework. Truffle aims to make a developer\u2019s life easier by providing a development environment, testing framework, and debugging tools for smart contract development. Smart contract bugs can be hard to find, and error messages can be very obscure. When building smart contracts using Truffle, the Truffle Debugger comes in very handy when it is time to debug a contract. This is because when debugging a smart contract, you\u2019re not running the code in real time; instead, you are stepping into the historical execution of that transaction on the blockchain, and mapping that execution onto its associated code. This process of debugging can be tedious to reason about traditionally, and this is where the Truffle Debugger really helps \u2014 by allowing us to debug any transactions as long as we have the code and the artifacts of the transaction. Let\u2019s talk briefly about the Truffle Debugger and then take an example to show how this tool can be used.Debugging is a cyclic activity involving execution testing and code correction.Truffle DebuggerTruffle Debugger is a command line tool integrated into the Truffle Framework which allows smart contract transactions to be debugged using the smart contract code and transaction artifacts. When the debugger is started, the command line interface provides a list of addresses transacted against or created during the course of the transactions, an initial entry point for the transaction and a list of available commands for using the debugger. Some of the debugger commands are highlighted below:[o] step over:This command evaluates the instructions evaluated by the virtual machine relative to the contract until the next line in the current smart contract file, skipping the functions referenced at the current execution point(if any).[i] step into:This command steps into the function called at the current execution point.[u] step out:This command will have the debugger step out of the current function, to the next line executed right after it.[n] step next:This command steps to the next logical statement or expression in the current function called.[;] step instruction:This command steps through each individual instruction evaluated by the virtual machine.You can check out other commands hereThus far, we have talked about debugging, and the Truffle Debugger, let\u2019s have an example to really drive this home.Debugging a FoodCart smart contractThe smart contract below models a simple food cart which allows anyone to add food items to the cart for sale and also allows anyone with enough ether to buy a food item off the cart. This contract is just for the purpose of illustration, and it should not be used in a production environment. Before we start this example, the following are required to follow this example without any issues:Truffle 4.0 or aboveSolidity compiler version 0.4.24 or abovePrivate blockchain (Ganache CLI v6.1.6 or above)The repository for this article can be found here, just in case you want to follow through the debugging process without coding the smart contract.Step 1: Building the smart contractLet\u2019s start by creating a directory for this project and building the smart contract. At the terminal enter in the following commands:mkdir FoodCartEnter into the folder and create a bare the truffle project.cd FoodCarttruffle initNavigate into the contracts folder and create a FoodCart.sol smart contract filecd contractstouch FoodCart.solOpen your FoodCart project in any IDE of your choice. I will be using Visual Studio code. Why? I really don\u2019t know \u2026lol. \ud83d\ude02. Open the FoodCart.sol contract and type in the smart contract below:Before we proceed any further, let me explain the smart contract above. The FoodCart smart contract can be sectioned into 6 parts:The state variables: The state variables, owner and skuCount store the address of the owner and the count of food items added to the FoodCart respectively. The mapping foodItems maps skus to food items.The enum: The State enum is a user-defined data type that holds the state of the food items on the cart. The types listed in the enum are explicitly convertible to and from integers, i.e (ForSale = 0, Sold = 1).The events: The events ForSale and Sold log the details of the food items that are put on sale or sold. These events can be called by callbacks in javascript and their contents can be used to make using dApps more interactive.The struct: The struct FoodItem is a user-defined type which holds the properties of a food item. These properties can be accessed using a dot notation on the struct.The function modifiers: The modifiers doesFoodItemExist, isFoodItemForSale, and hasBuyerPaidEnough are functions that automatically check a condition prior to executing the function on which they are applied to. The roles of the function modifiers used in this smart contract are obvious from their names.The functions: The functions addFoodItem, buyFoodItem and fetchFoodItem adds food items to the contract, allows a food item to be bought and allows the details of food item to be viewed respectively. The constructor function initializes the owner state variable with the address that the contract is deployed on. The anonymous payable function allows ether to the sent to this contract.Step 2: Deploying the smart contractLet\u2019s deploy the smart contract on the private network.In your IDE, create a new file called 2_foodcart_migration.js in the migrations folder. Open this file after creating it and add this code:This piece of code will enable the framework to deploy our FoodCart.sol contract to the private blockchain.Open your terminal and navigate into the folder for this project and type this command:truffle developThis command starts a development blockchain with which we can start testing our contract. Running that command should produce this result:The image above shows that a development blockchain has been started on port 9545, test accounts have also been created for use, and the terminal is navigated to a new prompt truffle(develop)>.In the truffle(develop)> prompt, type the compile command to compile the contract. The result of the compilation is stored in the build folder of your project directory.truffle(develop)> compileRunning the compile command should produce this result:Finally, let\u2019s migrate the compiled contract to the blockchain for deployment. At the terminal, type the migrate command to migrate the contract to the development blockchain that has been started for us.truffle(develop)> migrateRunning the migrate command should produce this result:Step 3: Interacting with the smart contractLet\u2019s interact with our smart contract and get a feel of how it works. We will be adding food items to the food cart, checking the details of food items added to the cart, and also buy food items off the cart with Ether from one of the accounts created for us when we started the development blockchain.Still in the truffle(develop)> prompt, create a foodCart variable and store the instance of the deployed contract in it.truffle(develop)> let foodCart; truffle(develop)> FoodCart.deployed().then((instance) => { foodCart = instance; });In the short code snippet above, we access the deployed FoodCart contract via the web3 .deployed method which returns a promise interface and we pass a function which stores the instance of the deployed contract in the foodCart variable. With the instance of the contract stored in the foodCart variable, we can access the functions of the contract through the foodCart variable.Let\u2019s add some food items to the food cart by running the following code snippets at the truffle(develop)> prompt. First, let\u2019s add a function that will help us add food items and print the result of the transaction at the console easily.The addFoodItemToCart function allows us to easily add food items to the cart by passing the name and price of the food item to the function as arguments when it is called. The function acts as a wrapper for the addFoodItem in the smart contract by making the smart contract calls for us and formating the log output returned from the function call. We can add some food items with the addFoodItemToCart function by running this commands:Now that we have about 3 food items on the the food cart, let\u2019s buy some food items off the cart. Before we can buy a food item, we need to specify what address we will be using to make our purchase, because it is from this address that we can get the funds in ether to buy food items. Recall that when we started our private blockchain, 10 test accounts were created for us and each of these accounts was credited with 100 ether which we can use to buy anything we want, we are rich \ud83e\udd11\ud83e\udd11. Let\u2019s create a variable to store one of these addresses or accounts so that we can easily call it anytime we want.truffle(develop)> const buyerAddress = web3.eth.accounts[1]; truffle(develop)> buyerAddress '0xf17f52151ebef6c7334fad080c5704d77216b732'Since we have an account 0xf17f52151ebef6c7334fad080c5704d77216b732 (yours will be different), we can add a function to buy food items off the food cart at our truffle(develop)> prompt.The buyFoodItemFromCart allows us to buy food items off the cart by calling the function with the itemSku and amount of the item. The amount to be paid for the item is taken from the account that was stored in our buyerAddress variable. Let\u2019s buy Fried Rice off the food cart. From our previous transactions, we recall that the sku for Fried Rice is 0 and it\u2019s price is 10 wei. So at the truffle(develop)> prompt, we call the buyFoodItemFromCart function with these values:From the output, we see that the state of the item is Sold and the foodItemExist is now false, indicating that this item is no longer for sale.Step 4: Debugging errors in the smart contractIf you have made it thus far, you deserve a Noble prize for Tenacity \ud83c\udf96, enjoy the fame it brings. So far, we have seen how the contract should behave. To be able to use the Truffle Debugger feature, we would introduce some errors while interacting with the contract and then use the debugger to debug the error and get it fixed. To debug a transaction, we need to have the hash of the transaction and then run command debug [transaction hash] at the truffle(develop)> prompt followed by any of the debugger commands until we find out where the transaction failed.We will try the following invalid transactions:Try to buy a food item that does not existTry to pay an amount less than the price of a food itemBefore we start these transactions, we need to start the truffle develop logger in another terminal, but still in the sample project. Open a new terminal, navigate to the FoodCart project and run this command truffle develop --log.FoodCart $ truffle develop --logYou should get this output:Connected to existing Truffle Develop session at http://127.0.0.1:9545/The logger connects to an existing session at the port specified, listens for transaction events, and logs the output of the transaction which should include items like transaction hash, block number, etc. Let\u2019s go ahead and make the life of our contract a living hell \ud83d\udc79.Invalid Transaction #1: Try to buy a food item that does not existFrom our previous transaction where we added food items to cart, we had skus 0, 1, 2 respectively for the 3 food items. We will try to use the sku 6 to buy a food item that does not exist.Trying to buy the item as shown in the command above produces the error UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: Error: VM Exception while processing transaction: revert ... which does not really tell us what or where the problem came from. Now, this can be a real headache when there\u2019s no debugger. I have spent many hours trying to debug a smart contract without using the debugger and it can drain the last blood out of one. Let\u2019s have a look at log output and see what we have there.The most important content of the log to us is the transaction hash 0x90a2ef83e54426848523a4edcf0c9628045e03c69d95f989c5b3b557367c848c, this will be different from what you have on your machine. With the transaction hash, we can debug the transaction and figure out where the problem is. Let\u2019s debug this transaction. Copy the hash of the transaction from your debugger terminal and run this command: debug your-trasanction-hash at the truffle(develop)> prompt. Your output should look like this:From the image, we see that when the debug command is run, the debugger compiles the contracts, gathers transaction data, fetches the address that was affected and the contract that was deployed at that address, and shows a list of debugger commands that we can use to interact with the debugger. The most interactive command to use at the debugger is the step next command which steps through all the instructions executed during a transaction one at a time. The step next command is executed by pressing enter or n, at the keyboard of course.At the debug(develop:0x90a2ef83...)> prompt, press enter continuously, following each instruction step until we reach the instruction where the transaction failed. There are 8 steps before we reach the final instruction that halted our transaction - you will have to press enter 9 times to reach the halting instruction. Let\u2019s look at the first 4 steps from this image below:From the image, we see that at line 61, the buyFoodItem function was called, but before the execution of the function, the modifier doesFoodItemExist at line 64 was called to check if the food item to be bought exists in the cart. On further inspection, on line 33, we see that the modifier uses the require function to ensure that the foodItemExist property of the food item with the sku given is true. Let\u2019s check what happened in the rest of the steps in the image below:At last step on line 33 in the image above, we see that the transaction halted because the transaction failed the required condition to be able to buy a food item from the cart. The item that we wanted to buy does not exist. The require function throws a state-reverting exception when a condition to which it is applied to fails. A state-reverting exception reverts or undoes all changes made to the state in the current call (and all its sub-calls) and also flag an error to the caller. We have been able to successfully debug this code using the Truffle Debugger, and it has been pretty amazing.Invalid Transaction #2: Try to pay an amount less than the price of a food itemIn this transaction, we will try to buy a food item with less amount than the price of the food item. In \u2018step 3: Interacting with the smart contract\u2019, we added 3 food items. Let\u2019s try to buy \u2018Chicken Pepper Soup\u2019 with sku 1 and price 10 wei. At the truffle(develop)> prompt, call the buyFoodItem function to buy a food item with less amount than the price.truffle(develop)> buyFoodItemFromCart(1, 5); truffle(develop)> (node:40269) UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: Error: VM Exception while processing transaction: revertExpectedly, this transaction fails, giving a cryptic error message as usual. To debug this transaction, we go to our log terminal and copy the hash of the transaction. On my machine the transaction hash is 0x5dc12d3ac524cfd1e3c0ea9265a155149ff16fcb18f904016a87e83cca5f9a30. With this transaction hash, we shall debug the transaction and figure out where the transaction halted.truffle(develop)> debug 0x2ad4c056a678f221d761d0bc11f641f6b4e63b3016587acd8b16ccf5295bd4d3Like we did in the first debugging process, we will use the step next debugger command to step through the transactions as it is very interactive and shows all the instructions that have been executed until we reach the instruction that halted the transaction. Use enter to step through the transaction history until you reach the instruction that halted the transaction as shown in the image below:In the image above, we see that at line 44, the modifier hasBuyerPaidEnough is called before the buyFoodItemFromCart function is executed, and at line 45, the modifier requires that value sent by the buyer is greater than or equal to the price of the item. However, we know that we flouted this condition hence, it halted our transaction. So if we send the right amount, we will surely buy the food item we need.ConclusionIn conclusion, the importance of using a debugger while building smart contracts cannot be overemphasized. With a debugger, we can test our modifiers to ensure that our contract behaves appropriately, we can ensure that our contracts are secure by sending malicious transactions to our contract to see how it will behave and properly debug the transaction to see the instructions that have been executed up until the transaction halted, if it did. Most importantly, we can save our most valuable asset which is time, by using a debugger whenever we face issues with our smart contracts, instead of fumbling around with our code.References:Truffle DebuggerDebugging and TestingIntelliJ IDEA Debug ToolsOriginally published at www.mayowatudonu.com.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Smart Contracts", "Debugging", "Debugging Smart Contracts", "Debug Smart Contracts"]}, {"title": "Deploy your own smart contract with Truffle and Ganache CLI \u2014 Beginner Tutorial (Part II)", "post_link": "https://medium.com/haloblock/deploy-your-own-smart-contract-with-truffle-and-ganache-cli-beginner-tutorial-c46bce0bd01e?source=search_post", "author_name": "HaloBlock Official", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@haloblock", "publish_date": "2018-07-02", "last_modified_date": "2018-08-07", "readtime": "4.17", "claps": 400, "voters": 26, "content": "Deploy your own smart contract with Truffle and Ganache CLI \u2014 Beginner Tutorial (Part II)HaloBlock OfficialFollowJul 2, 2018 \u00b7 5 min readIn PwC\u2019s latest report of ICO (Initial Coin Offerings), there are 537 successful ICOs with a volume of $13.7 billion in the first 5 months of 2018, which is more than all pre-2018 ICOs combined. Almost all of ICOs are based on smart contracts of Ethereum.Our last article shows how to create a simple virtual token on the browser based IDE. In this article, we will show you a step-by-step instruction on setting up a smart contract on your local environment.We need two tools for building local smart contract environments: Truffle and Ganache CLI.TruffleAs one of the most popular Ethereum development frameworks, Truffle helps you create basic solidity templates to deploy.Ganache CLIIt\u2019s the command line version of Ganache. It\u2019s used to simulate full client behavior and make developing Ethereum applications faster, easier, and safer.In this article, we will explain in details on how to set up Truffle and Ganache CLI in Ubuntu 16.04.PrerequisitesOperating system: any version of Ubuntu 16.04.Software: npm.Install npm:$ sudo apt-get update$ sudo apt-get install nodejs$ sudo apt-get install npmTo know whether it\u2019s successful installed, try to check its version:$ npm -vIf you can see the version number, then you are ready to go! Please make sure that the version number is 5.0+. If it\u2019s not, try to run the following:$ sudo apt-get install npm@5.0.0Install Truffle and Ganache CLIEnsure that you have installed npm with version 5.0+ on your system.Run the following command:$ sudo npm install -g ganache-cli truffleThis is a global installation, so no need to worry about the installed location.Run Ganache CLIAfter installation, you can start to develop your own smart contracts.First, you need to create a simulated environment for running smart contracts on your local computer:$ ganache-cliThen, you will see results like below:Ganache CLI automatically creates 10 accounts associated with 10 private keys. Each account has 100 ethers for testing purpose.Note: Ganache CLI is running on the memory, so everything will be back to fresh if restart occurs.Build a \u201cHelloWorld\u201d smart contractStep 1: With Ganache CLI running behind, let\u2019s start with a new terminal, and run the commands below:$ mkdir SmartContractDemo$ cd SmartContractDemo/$ mkdir HelloWorld$ cd HelloWorld/$ truffle initStructures:/contracts: store original codes of the smart contract. We will place our HelloWorld.sol file here./migrations: deploy the smart contract in the \u201ccontracts\u201d folder./test: test codes for your smart contract, support both JavaScript and Solidity.truffle.js: configuration document.truffle-config.js: configuration document for windows user. We can just leave it alone. (However, if your Ubuntu 16.04 is running on a virtual machine under Windows, then your configuration should also go here.)Step 2: Create \u201cHelloWorld\u201d contract.There are two ways to create a new contract:Directly place \u201cHelloWorld.sol\u201d file under \u201ccontracts\u201d folder.In the \u201cHelloWorld\u201d folder, run command:$ truffle create contract HelloWorldCopy the following codes into \u201cHelloWorld.sol\u201d:pragma solidity ^0.4.18;Contract HelloWorld {    function hi() public pure returns (string) {        return (\u201cHello World\u201d);    }}Step 3: Compile \u201cHelloWorld\u201d with the following command.$ truffle compileThis compiles the original code into Ethereum bytecode. If everything goes well, it will create .json file under build/contracts folder.Step 4: Deploy \u201cHelloWorld\u201d contract.Step 4.1: Create a js file under migrations, name it \u201c2_deploy_contracts.js\u201d.Step 4.2: Copy and past the following deploying content into the \u201c2_deploy_contracts.js\u201d.var HelloWorld=artifacts.require (\u201c./HelloWorld.sol\u201d);module.exports = function(deployer) {      deployer.deploy(HelloWorld);}Step 4.3: Modify truffle.js file (or truffle-config.js if you are a windows user), like below:Step 4.4: Run the following command:$ truffle migrateIn the meantime, there are a lot of logs in the terminal running Ganache CLI, like below:\ud83c\udf89Congrats! The \u201cHelloWorld\u201d smart contract has been successfully deployed to Ganache.ConclusionAs you can see, it\u2019s easy to set up the working environment for a smart contract. This is just the first step. In our future blogs, we will share more technical details about how to modify contracts, how to add more functionalities to contracts, and how to secure contracts.By Quan Sun, Security Researcher from HaloBlock.io", "responses": 4, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Deployment", "Smart Contracts", "Tutorial", "Blog"]}, {"title": "Deploying Smart Contracts To An Azure Blockchain Using Truffle", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@ChristianValade/deploying-smart-contracts-to-an-azure-blockchain-using-truffle-5a5adcef7e6f?source=search_post", "author_name": "Christian Valadez", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@ChristianValade", "publish_date": "2017-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2018-05-09", "readtime": "3.11", "claps": 250, "voters": 24, "content": "Deploying Smart Contracts To An Azure Blockchain Using TruffleChristian ValadezFollowAug 29, 2017 \u00b7 4 min readIn this tutorial, I\u2019ll talk about how to migrate Solidity smart contracts to your own personal blockchain. I\u2019ll be using the standard \u201cMetaCoin\u201d contract that comes included when creating a new Truffle project.If you haven't already, make sure you complete the Deploying An Ethereum Consortium Blockchain on Azure tutorial first, as it goes over creating an Ethereum network and logging in with Geth.We\u2019ll be using the Truffle Framework to migrate our smart contracts onto Azure. Make sure you have Node installed, and run:$ npm install -g truffleStarting A Project$ mkdir truffleProject$ cd truffleProject$ truffle init This initializes a Truffle project within the truffleProject folder. If we open our folder, we\u2019ll see folders for contracts, migrations, and test, along with a truffle.js file.Truffle Project directoryThe truffle.js file contains the information for deploying smart contracts onto a blockchain network. Currently, the configuration is set so that contracts are deployed to a local network, for use with testrpc. We need to add the endpoints for connecting to our Ethereum network on Azure.Default settings: deploys to testrpc networkIn Azure, go to your deployment configuration screen and grab the \u201cADMIN-SITE\u201d and \u201cETHEREUMNETWORKID\u201d fields. (If you need help finding this screen, see the previous tutorial.)Deployment configuration screenNow, in the truffle.js file, add a new network:// Truffle.js file module.exports = {  networks: {    development: {      host: \"localhost\",      port: 8545,      network_id: \"*\" // Match any network id    },    azureNetwork: {      host: \"testo6ihw.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com\",       network_id: 10101010,      port: 8545    }  }};You can name it whatever you want. In my case, I named it \u201cazureNetwork\u201d, and added the host from the \u201cADMIN-SITE\u201d output and the network ID from the \u201cETHEREUMNETWORKID\u201d field.We\u2019re almost ready to deploy. There\u2019s just one more step: we need to unlock our Ethereum account. By default, accounts in Geth are \u201clocked,\u201d meaning that sending transactions is not allowed. Creating a smart contract on the blockchain is a transaction and requires gas, and so we need to unlock our default account.Log on to your Ethereum network on Azure using SSH. Once you\u2019re logged in, run:$ geth attach // Opens the Javascript console > personal.unlockAccount(personal.listAccounts[0], \"MyPassword20!\", 0)// Unlock 1st account using your password, indefinitely Note: Using the Javascript console to unlock an account will log your password.

The best stack in my mind would be to use Truffle for contract development and Unity to flesh out the client.I just spent the last 8 hours trying to figure all of this out. I got a ton of help from their team and the Loom community, and I\u2019ve decided to log my progress here in hopes of this being the last time someone has to struggle with this.Step 1: Install LoomThis part\u2019s easy. Just follow the tutorial here for your operating system. Once it\u2019s installed just start it up.They also have a few Docker containers that they keep up to date. The links to them are at the bottom of this page.Step 2: Set Up Your ProjectMy project looks like thisStep 3: Set Up Truffle in the dappchain FolderIn the dappchain folder I\u2019ve followed this short tutorial to get a barebones truffle project set up.Just go in there and run yarn deploy to get your contracts up onto your loom chain.NOTE: If deploying doesn\u2019t work or is giving you errors, there\u2019s a couple things that could be wrong!It might not be able to connect to your Loom node. If you\u2019re running it on another computer or on a VM make sure the IP is set correctly in truffle.js or truffle-config.jsSome Truffle and Solc versions don\u2019t play nice with Loom. Make sure Truffle is on v4.1.8 and Solc is on v0.4.23Step 4: Set Up Your Unity Project in unityclient FolderIn the unityclient folder I grabbed the Unity 3D SDK and just threw it in (they don\u2019t have a Unity package available yet).Step 5: Tell Truffle to Export Your ABIs and AddressesFirst, go into your Unity project and create the directories Assets/Resources/contracts/abi and Assets/Resources/contracts/addressThese folders are where your contract data is going to be exported.Now back in your Truffle project, add a file in your migrations folder called 99_export_abis.js Your project should look something like this nowEvery step in your migrations folder get\u2019s called when you migrate/deploy and 99 will make it the last step. Here\u2019s what they should look like:These will work assuming you\u2019re project is set up exactly the same as mine. If you changed any of the names, make sure you update the paths in the code above.Also, make sure you run yarn deploy or yarn deploy:reset to make sure these ABIs and Address files get put into your Unity project\u2019s directory.Step 6: Set Up Your Unity SceneGo ahead and create a new scene, and in that new scene create an empty game object with a new script called SimpleStoreHandler attached. Should look like this:And here\u2019s what should be in your SimpleStoreHandler scriptIt\u2019s all pretty well commented, but if you have any questions about it let me know!Conclusion: TestingTry running the Unity project! You should see a few messages and some data coming in from Loom!If you run into any problems let me know! I\u2019ll be adding any other hitches other people run into and tell me about. Hopefully this setup process doesn\u2019t have to be as daunting!Edit: Troubleshooting some errorsException: JSON-RPC Error -32603 (Internal error): name is not registeredIf you get this error in Unity, it means you\u2019re trying to access your contract by name when you should be accessing it by it\u2019s address.

One aspect that I find tricky to wrap my head around is unit testing, and writing testable code. This is a real problem given how much more important it is for code to execute correctly on a blockchain. There\u2019s no room for bugs, and so the testing is very important!This post will address an issue that I have been working on recently, where a unit test was required to take an action, and then wait for a number of blocks to pass. I will explain how I achieved this using Truffle\u2019s testing framework to artificially move their testing chain forward. I\u2019ll supply helper functions in JavaScript that you can do this type of test by simply typing:helper.advanceTimeAndBlock(secondsToAdvance)Significant credit is due to Gareth for coming up with this solution!The EdgeFund platform development is starting to take shape now. EdgeFund is a betting platform which requires a user to place a bet by issuing a transaction, and then waiting some blocks before checking back to see if their bet has won.To test this functionality, the following steps need to happen:A user sends a transaction that places a bet on block \u2018n\u2019.The blockchain moves forward 5 blocks and ~60 secondsThe user checks if their bet is a winner and issues another transaction to claim their winnings on block \u2018n+5\u2019This function is obviously not possible on the main network, or ever the public test nets, the the block creation and timestamping is done by the miners. However, it is possible when testing locally through two helper functions provided by the ganache-cli. These functions are:evm_increaseTimeevm_mineThese functions are triggered by sending a transaction like this:web3.currentProvider.send({     jsonrpc: \"2.0\",     method: \"evm_increaseTime\",     params: [600],     id: 123     })Or:web3.currentProvider.send({     jsonrpc: \"2.0\",     method: \"evm_mine\",     id: 123     })There is one very important point to consider. When a block is mined, the timestamp of that block is printed into it and cannot be changed. The evm_increaseTime function does not change the time of the most recently mined block. It changes the time of the next block. In order to \u2018see\u2019 the new time, the next block has to be mined using the evm_mine function.The following JavaScript wraps up these functions, making it really easy to write time travelling unit tests!To make use of the above, add it into your truffle testing folder at helpers\\truffleTestHelper.js The functions can be accessed in your test functions as per the example code below:That\u2019s it! Simple enough when you know how I guess, but this took us quite a bit of searching to piece together this solution. I hope that post pulls everything together for the next coder looking to do this!I am currently working on EdgeFund, an open-source platform which offers a decentralised shared bankroll on the Blockchain.

I recommend using Ganache, which you install by running npm install -g ganache-cli.Next let\u2019s make sure we have our ganache running in the background. Open your terminal and run the command ganache-cli. That's all! It runs on port 8545by default, just like most Ethereum RPCs, and so does Truffle.Also note that when ganachefirst starts, it prints out a list of accounts that will be pre-funded with ether, along with a twelve-word seed phrase for re-generating those accounts. You can use this seed phrase to initialize your MetaMask client with the same accounts, and you\u2019ll have lots of Ether when you start! (Ether is used to pay for network usage, or gas, on the Ethereum network)If you wanted to start up ganachewith the accounts you already have in MetaMask, you can tell ganachewhat seed phrase to use with the -m flag. For example:$ ganache-cli -m \"concert load couple harbor equip island argue ramp clarify fence smart topic\"Setting up a simple Truffle DappNext, let\u2019s generate a basic Truffle dapp. The default result of truffle initis a simple example currency.To get it up and running, run these commands:mkdir metacoin# Create a folder for your new dappcd metacoin# Move into that foldertruffle init # Initialize a default truffle project in that foldertruffle compilertruffle migrate # Build, compile, & deploy the dapptruffle test test/metacoin.jsSetting up MetamaskIf you visit it, you\u2019ll see that by default this new Dapp template signs you in with the first account on your ganache-cli account list, which happens to be the same account that got pre-populated with 10k shiny new Metacoins! That's because when you ran truffle migrate, Truffle used your first account as the contract publisher, and the contract says to fund the creator's account with 10k coins.You can now send those coins to any account you want, for example, the second account in your ganache-cli list! If you enter an address and a value, and hit send, you'll see your balance go down!If that seems a little too easy, I\u2019d agree with you! That\u2019s why Metamask gives the user an opportunity to approve every transaction that a Dapp attempts, and that\u2019s more secure!Let\u2019s try connecting to the same account through Metamask, and see how easy it is!Setting up MetamaskNow you\u2019ll want to install Metamask from the Chrome store.Please see how to install MetamaskOpen MetamaskClick the current network name in the top right.Select Custom RPCSet the current RPCLocalhost:8545address.5. fill in the second account (0x035b9094158fc6af051242b6c04444c017b7e17c) and amount of 36. You will see the the result of transaction.This has been a simple example, but hopefully shows how Truffle and Metamask work together. They are able to pretty much work out of the box!

However, as our project is growing bigger and bigger, it is good to have an automatic way of smart contracts development. In addition, testing Solidity code is crucial to avoid any problematic situation caused by a bug in the smart contract. There are different frameworks available for taking care of the development process. Truffle is one of them and is often regarded as the Ethereum Swiss Knife framework as it is a development environment, testing framework and asset pipeline for Ethereum.ObjectivesThis tutorial is aimed to get started with Truffle and write some tests to check the basic features offered by Solidity.Create a truffle project and configure a development networkCreate and deploy smart contractsInteract with the smart contract from Truffle consoleWrite tests for testing main features offered by SolidityPrerequisitesDownload and install node.jsInstall Truffle globally: In order to install truffle globally on your machine, open a terminal and run this command$ npm install truffle -gInstall ganache-cli:Ganache is a personal and local blockchain for Ethereum development and provides a very good environment to deploy smart contracts and run tests. Ganache is available as a desktop application as well as a command line tool. In this tutorial, we are going to install ganache as a command line tool by running the following command in the terminal:$ npm install ganache-cli -g1. Creating a Truffle ProjectIn the next few lines of code, we are going to create a directory and initialize it with Truffle to create a basic project skeleton.$ mkdir truffle-demo$ cd truffle-demo$ truffle initOn successful initialization, we will see the following message in the console:If we look at the newly created directory, Truffle has created a boilerplate file structure:Let\u2019s have a brief walk through of these files and folders:truffle.jsThis is the configuration file that contains information such as development network settings for the project. This file will be used to configure the development network.truffle-config.jsThis is the same file as truffle.js and used in case of windows system run into a conflict problem while executing the generic Truffle commands. So, in that case, this file will be used instead of truffle.js file.contractsThis folder is a container for all of our smart contracts. Truffle goes to the contracts folder and looks for the compatible files ( .sol ) to compile while compiling the project. The folder already contains a Migrations.sol file.migrationsThe configurations for migrating the contract over the network are written in a JavaScript file. These settings basically define how (for example: in what order) smart contracts will be deployed over the blockchain. All those migration files will go inside the migration folder. This folder contains a file 1_initial_migration.js that will deploy the Migrations.sol contract to the blockchain.testAll the tests \u2014 either written in Solidity or JavaScript \u2014 will go to this folder.In addition, Truffle will create a build folder to hold artifacts of the compiled contracts. We will see this folder when we run $ truffle compile command but before that, we need to set up our private network first.2. Preparing the Test EnvironmentAfter having installed ganache-cli, open a terminal and run$ ganache-cliGanache has created ten accounts with some amount of ether for executing the development tasks. It also opens the RPC port 8545at localhost.Next, we need to configure network settings in truffle.js file as shown below:In these lines of code, we have configured a single development network running on 127.0.0.1:8545.Line 2 defines an object which is keyed by a network name that is development in this case.On the next lines, hostand port parameters of the network are configured.Line 6 gives a development network that matches any network it connects to.So far we have initiated our truffle project, set up private network and ganache-cli running. In order to check if everything is set up correctly, type:$ truffle testWe will see the following output:Compiling .\\contracts\\Migrations.sol...0 passing (1ms)Now we are good to go!3. Smart Contract Development with TruffleThe general workflow for smart contract development with Truffle can be accomplished with the following steps:Writing the Smart ContractLet\u2019s create a simple smart contract by typing the following command in the terminal:$ truffle create contract SimpleContractIn the contracts folder, Truffle has just created SimpleContract.sol file with the smart contract boilerplate. Let\u2019s populate this file with a bit of Solidity code:We have just created a SimpleContractwhich contains a constructor, a getterand a settermethod.Line 1 specifies the version pragma for Solidity compiler.Line 3 defines the name of the contract.Line 4 declares a public string variable name.Line 6 uses the constructor function, that means this function will be automatically executed once when the smart contract is created. In this case, the value of the above declared variable name will be set to \u2018my name\u2019 when the contract is created.Line 10 is the getter function that will return the value of name. By default, The compiler automatically creates getter functions for all public state variables. However, for the sake of understanding, I have just created a getter function here.Line 14 defines another function to change the value of our name variable.This is a very simple smart contract with constructor, one getter and one setter function. In the next step, we will compile this contract.Compile the Smart ContractIn order to compile the smart contracts, run the following command:$ truffle compileThis will compile all the smart contracts from the contracts folder and create artifacts in the contracts folder of the newly created build directory.If we open the contract folder file from the build directory, we can see that these files are the abstraction of smart contracts and contain the following information:contract nameABI (a list of all functions along with their parameter and return values)bytecodedeployed bytecodecompiler name and versionA list of networks onto which the contract has been deployed (once the contract is deployed)address of the contract with respect to each network the contract is deployed to (once the contract is deployed)These are .json files and act as a JavaScript wrapper to interact with the respective smart contracts.Writing MigrationsIn order to deploy smart contract over the blockchain, we first need to write the configurations for migration in a JavaScript file. These files are basically responsible for staging the deployment tasks of smart contracts over the blockchain. But, to deploy the smart contracts with migrations we need to access their artifacts which were created as a result of truffle compile command.In order to create a migration file, run the following command in the terminal:$ truffle create migration deploy_sample_contractIf you go to the migrations folder, you will see a JavaScript migration file is created which is prefixed by a random number and suffixed by a description. This is because the history of previously run migrations is recorded on the blockchain and truffle migrate will start execution from the last run migration. The numbered prefixed is required and is used to record either a migration has been run successfully or not. Open the newly created file in text editor and change the contents as follows:In line 1, we are specifying which contract is going to use for interaction using artifacts.require()method. This method is similar to node.js require method. However, it will return a contract abstraction that will be used for the rest of the deployment script. The important thing here is we have to pass the name of the contract definition and not the name of .sol file. Because a source file may contain more than one contracts.At line 3, module.export() is used to export the migrations. This method export a function which accepts a deployer object as its first parameter. The deployer object is the main interface for staging the deployment tasks and has many functions available to simplify migrations. At line 5, we are using deploy method from deployer in order to deploy our SimpleContract.After writing the artifacts, make sure that ganache-cli is running in the background and run:$ truffle migrateHere we can see the address (SimpleContract: 0x4f5c2b6471915398132b627fad0f3089ea5ddd05) where our contract is deployed.Interacting with the Smart ContractAs we now have the address of our deployed contract, we directly interact it using the truffle console. Run truffle console to open the console in the terminal:$ truffle consolein the console type (replace the address with your address)$ SimpleContract.at('0x4f5c2b6471915398132b627fad0f3089ea5ddd05');It will return the complete abstraction of our contract. We can get the ABIof the contract by typing the following command:$ SimpleContract.at('0x4f5c2b6471915398132b627fad0f3089ea5ddd05').abi;Similarly, we can call the functions of our contract:$ SimpleContract.at('0x4f5c2b6471915398132b627fad0f3089ea5ddd05').getName();now, first run the changeName()function and then run getName() function to see if the name is changed to the new name or not.$ SimpleContract.at('0x4f5c2b6471915398132b627fad0f3089ea5ddd05').changeName('your name');$ SimpleContract.at('0x4f5c2b6471915398132b627fad0f3089ea5ddd05').getName();When you are done playing with your smart contract, type $ .exit to close the console mode.4. Writing TestsIn general, smart contract test can be written both in Solidity and JavaScript. In this tutorial, We will continue with JavaScript using async/await notation.If we look at our contact again, we want to test:the constructor is successfully executed while creating the contract. This can be checked if our getterfunction returns the same value as passed in the constructor.the changeName method is successfully changing the value of the namevariable.Under the hood, Truffle uses Mocha testing framework and Chai assertion library to test the smart contracts. Furthermore, truffle test command will run the tests from all the test files inside the testfolder.But even before writing the tests in JavaScript, let\u2019s write a test to test the constructor in plain English for our getter method:\u201cThis method should return the name \u2018my name\u2019.\u201dYou might have noticed that in order to test a method from a particular contract, we need to refer to that contract first. We will do that in our actual test by requiring the artifacts created earlier. Let\u2019s create our test file by typing:$ truffle create test SimpleContractOpen the newly created simple_contract.js file from the test folder and we will find a basic test sample there. We can see that Truffle is using contract() instead of describe() as its main function. The contract() provides a list of account available by the Ethereum client (in our case Ganache) which can be used to write tests. Furthermore, it also groups together all the tests for a specific contract. Let\u2019s test the available accounts. Change the contents of your test file as below and run the following command:$ truffle testIn line 1, we are using artifacts.require() method to request a usable contract abstraction for a specific Solidity contract.In line 3, contract() method is used for grouping the tests. It uses a message in order to understand the purpose of the test.In line 4, it() is a Mocha notation for a test case.The actual test starts in line 4, what we are going to test. As a result, we will see a list of available accounts.Testing ConstructorNow let\u2019s write the actual test for the constructor:In line 6, we have created the instance of our contract to access its methods.In line 7, we are storing the return value of getName() method so that we can check it out.In line 9, we are asserting that the value should be equal to \u2018my name\u2019.Now run the $ truffle test command and we will see one test is passing!Next, we will add another test for our changeName() method. Add the following test at line 11 below test 1.In this test we are calling the changeName() method with \u2018your name\u2019 and in the next line, we are storing this value into a variable. Again run the $ truffle test command.Testing ModifiersThe use of function modifiers in the Solidity is also a common pattern to have a better control over contract\u2019s methods execution.Let\u2019s add a modifier onlyOwner() that will restrict the execution of a certain method only to the owner of the contract.We have created a private variable owner and assign it to the creator of the contract using the constructor function.In line 12, we have declared a function modifier which will check if the caller of the method is the owner of the contract, then continue ( _; ).In line 22, the function modifier is assigned to the method changeName() by adding the name of the modifier.Open the simple_contract.js file again and add the following test for the modifier. But before doing that, we will re-arrange the test to make our lives even easier.Instead of creating the contract instance for every test, we have created a global instance of the contract using the beforeEach hook provided by Mocha.As we have put the modifier for changeName() method, now only the owner should be able to change the name. This test is specified at line 23. If we run the $ truffle test command again, we see that the test is passed. This is because if we don\u2019t specify the account, ganache automatically uses the first account. In this case, the owner of the contract and caller of the method are the same, so why the test is passed. In order to really check the modifier, let\u2019s use the transaction object in our test:Use any other account other than the first account ( accounts[0]) from the list of available accounts and run the test again. You will see your test is failed now because the only owner can call this method. Although, using any other account other than the owner will lead to failing the test but we want our test to pass. This is important, because although the test is asserting a failing behavior, a test itself should always pass its assertion. Here comes the idea of revert into play. The truffle-assertions library has the ability to assert that a transaction reverts as expected. The truffle-assertions package adds additional assertions that can be used to revert transactions in the smart contracts.Install the package by running the following command in the terminal:$ npm install truffle-assertionsAlso import this package at the top or our test file, just below the liner requiring artifacts of the contract:const truffleAssert = require('truffle-assertions');add the following test and run the truffle test command again. At this time our test is passed with the expected behavior of the contract!Listening EventsUsing the truffle-assertions package that we just installed, we can:check the event typecheck events parametersprint the eventLet\u2019s add a name event that will be fired every time name is changed.event NameEvent(string evPram);now emit this event in the changeName() function as below:add the following test to check if a specific event is present in the transaction or not and run the truffle test command:We are saving the transaction into a result variable and then check that if \u2018NameEvent\u2019 is emitted by the transaction or not.Now we will check if the event is emitted with correct parameters:In the end, we are going to print out the event parameters and their values emitted by a particular event:after running the truffle test command, you will see the transaction emitting the event, name of the emitted event, its parameter, and values.The source code can be found here in this GitHub repo.Related articlesTruffleTruffle AssertionsMochaChai", "responses": 1, "tags": ["Truffle", "Smart Contracts", "Unit Testing"]}, {"title": "Using Ethermint with Truffle", "post_link": "https://blog.cosmos.network/using-ethermint-with-truffle-984e6721e30d?source=search_post", "author_name": "billy rennekamp", "author_link": "https://blog.cosmos.network/@billyrennekamp", "publish_date": "2017-09-18", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-09", "readtime": "3.64", "claps": 98, "voters": 18, "content": "Using Ethermint with Trufflebilly rennekampFollowSep 18, 2017 \u00b7 4 min readThis month I participated in the Cosmos Hackatom Hackathon. Cosmos is a company out of Tendermint who has created a protocol for making transactions on blockchains without incurring the huge costs of traditional mining (in electricity or miner fees) by using another method for consensus (Byzantine Fault Tolerance which is apparently vulnerable to untrustworthy nodes but whose achilles heel can be solved with Proof of Stake). One example of this Application BlockChain Interface (ABCI) is the creation of Ethermint, a Tendermint powered version of the Ethereum Blockchain.The project I worked on for the hackathon needs to take a series of moves from the board game Reversi and play the game inside of an Ethereum Contract in order to confirm the game is valid. If the game is valid and the endgame forms a symmetrical board the user receives a reward in an ERC20 Token (Reversi-Search as Proof-Of-Work\u2122). Even though the game is relatively simple to program, it includes lots of loops and arrays which are VERY expensive on the EVM, so naturally Ethermint would be a huge boon to the project (If you\u2019re interested in how to reduce costs by avoiding arrays check out this technique and if you\u2019re interested in the project check it out at clovers.network \u2013 Update: We won a prize!).InstallationInstall instructions are found on the github repo, it says you can download a binary from here but there was no Mac version listed so I followed the Install From Source instructions. First you need get Go, they recommended using gvm\u2014which was great because it handles aliases and I seem to always have trouble with aliases \u2014 remembering if I need to update $PATH in the terminal, in .bash_profile, in .baschrc, restart the terminal, flush something??The next parts were pretty straightforward and went off without a hitch following their instructions to first install Ethermint, then Tendermint, then initialize them with default files and finally run the damn thing. This is where I started having trouble, I got both programs to run in different terminal windows following their recommended start commands:tendermint --home ~/.ethermint/tendermint nodewhich spits out red errors until you switch to a new terminal window and do:ethermint --datadir ~/.ethermint --rpc --rpcaddr=0.0.0.0 --ws --wsaddr=0.0.0.0 --rpcapi eth,net,web3,personal,adminThe results look pretty similar to the few times I\u2019d tried running Geth on my machine. The instructions said I could use Truffle without any extra arguments so I gave it a shot\u2014no go.truffle compiletruffle migrate...Error encountered, bailing. Network state unknown. Review successful transactions manually.Error: authentication needed: password or unlockUnlockingSo I guess I need to unlock Ethermint first, I wasn\u2019t even sure what my wallet address was so I looked into the ~/.ethermint directory I\u2019d installed earlier and found a keystore that Itook to myetherwallet.com. I realized that since the keystore was in a hidden folder it wouldn\u2019t be present in the Finder dialogue but googled a helpful shortcut of Command-Shift-Period to make Finder show hidden files. I uploaded the keystore, unlocked it with 1234 and found my address.

I\u2019d see Nick talk about ENS at the London Ethereum Meetup a while back, and had integration with it in web3j on my todo list. However, given that I had Nick sat next to me, and a 9 hour flight in front of me, it was a no-brainer to start work on it then and there!ENSThe ENS support in web3j means that anywhere you previously had to use a contract or wallet address, you can now use an ENS domain name instead.I.e. For your smart contracts you can use:YourSmartContract contract = YourSmartContract.load(        \"<name>.ens\",         web3j, credentials, GAS_PRICE, GAS_LIMIT);It\u2019s also supported in web3j\u2019s command line tools:$ web3j wallet send <walletfile> <name>.ensThe web3j implementation provides input normalisation and validation adhering to UTS #46. Nick was adamant that any ENS implementations does this :).Truffle supportThe Truffle Framework is a very popular choice for both JavaScript and Solidity developers alike. Truffle provides a contract schema in JSON to represent contracts deployed to the various Ethereum networks.web3j can now work with Truffle JSON files for generating smart contract wrappers. This means that if you currently or have used Truffle for your smart contract development, you can generate smart contract wrappers in Java from them. The advantage of this approach is that your smart contracts will know where they\u2019ve been deployed previously.YourSmartContract contract = YourSmartContract.load(        YourSmartContract.getDeployedAddress(<network id>),         web3j, credentials, GAS_PRICE, GAS_LIMIT);Where the network id is as per EIP 155.To generate the wrapper files, there is a new truffle argument to the web3j command line tool:$ web3j truffle generate [--javaTypes|--solidityTypes] /path/to/<truffle-smart-contract-output>.json -o /path/to/src/main/java -p com.your.organisation.nameEzra Epstein deserves the credit for this change, as he had the idea and implemented it.Other changesFor details of other fixes with this release, please refer to the v3.1.0 release page.Are you using web3j?If you\u2019re using web3j and happy to add your project or company to the list of users of web3j please let us know!", "responses": 2, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Web3j", "Blockchain", "Ethereum Name Service", "Truffle"]}, {"title": "Using Truffle framework in an advanced way", "post_link": "https://medium.com/coinmonks/using-truffle-framework-in-an-advanced-way-7e32c11c97a9?source=search_post", "author_name": "NodeFactory", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@nodefactory", "publish_date": "2018-06-26", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-26", "readtime": "2.86", "claps": 260, "voters": 17, "content": "Using Truffle framework in an advanced wayNodeFactoryFollowJun 26, 2018 \u00b7 3 min readIf you are a blockchain developer or becoming one then you have probably heard of the Ethereum-Swiss-Knife framework called Truffle. Ethereum is in it\u2019s early stages and doesn\u2019t have many advanced tools like you got used to in regular web development. However, using Truffle you get to do things easier and faster because it offers automated contract testing that is almost a requirement (more like necessity) now during development. Also, it is the only tool that has some kind of debug feature.Here are a few things that we needed during development and that came really handy. If you are a beginner and using Truffle for the first time then come back here later, you will probably need this.Linking and initializing contracts on deploy automaticallyFirst, you should get familiar with the truffle migrate command that helps you deploy your contracts but also upgrade and redeploy the changed contracts only.But what about the contracts that depend on other contracts that you are deploying as well? Contracts that are dependencies should be updated with the newly deployed address. You can do this manually during production but what about tests? Let\u2019s dive into a solution.For example, we have a smart contract called Application that interacts with Storage smart contract. The goal is to deploy them both and update Application contract with the Storage contract\u2019s address.Here is our Application.sol file:Example of Application smart contractAnd our migration file:Deployment of Application and Storage smart contractsThe code above creates 4 transactions:Deployment of the Application contractDeployment of the Storage contractUpdating storage address in Application contractUpdating Truffle\u2019s Migrations contract that tracks migrations onchainTo save up some gas, you could add constructor to Application contract which would accept address of storage contract as function parameter. Then our example would look like this:Upgraded Application smart contractMigration of Storage contract:Simple deployment of Storage smart contractAnd migration of Application contract:Simple deployment of Application smart contractThis way we will make one transaction less than before and thus save some gas.Testing time based functionsOften you will find yourself writing time-dependent code i.e. checking if a certain time has passed before withdraw/deposit. If you are using ganache-cli (ex. testrpc) for local network and testing, then you can use special RPC function evm_increasetime during your tests.Here is how it can be used:Helper function to increase network timestampTo wait during tests for 24 hours you can call it:await utils.increaseTime(24 * 60 * 60);Mocha multi reportersIf you are like us and you use some sort of CI (Continuous Integration) like CircleCi, you would probably want your test results in some common format. Most CI tools require test results in JUnit XML format.Truffle by default uses spec reporter which nicely formats test result onto console window. You could easily change this to mocha-junit-reporter, it\u2019s just matter of running \u201cnpm install mocha-junit-reporter\u201d and adding following mocha config entry in your truffle.js file:Added parameter for mocha in truffle.js fileThis solution is nice for CI but it\u2019s not very user friendly when it comes to running test locally and then checking xml file for test results. Luckily there is something called mocha-multi-reporters .For configuring multi reporters, first install dependencies:npm install - -save-dev mocha-multi-reporters mocha-junit-reporterAdd following mocha configuration to your truffle.js:Upgraded parameter for mocha in truffle.js fileYou\u2019ve probably notices that we are using mocha-reporter-config.json. Using this file, we can configure multi reporter to use both spec and mocha-junit-reporter.Example of mocha-reporter-config.json fileAs you probably noticed, you can even decide where you want your test results to be stored.Developing dApps on ethereum requires complex setup with whole bunch of frameworks and tools.

Unfortunately, currently, it doesn\u2019t work with Typescript. Creating typings for Truffle API is not the only problem, the real challenge is creating typings for smart contracts under development.Last year we\u2019ve presented Typechain \u2014 a way to generate dynamic typings for smart contracts based on their ABIs. Back then we\u2019ve used Web3 0.20.x and developed custom wrappers build on top. Now if you use Truffle we got you covered!Truffle meets TypechainTypechain changed in a great way since the original announcement. Almost 300 Github \u2b50 laters, we have support for multiple targets, including Truffle! Now it\u2019s as easy as:typechain \u2014 target truffle ./build/**/*.jsonWe have also developed typings to \u201cstatic\u201d parts of Truffle API.The whole setup is described in example repo that we\u2019ve prepared.Okay, okay but why?If you\u2019re not a Typescript user, here\u2019s a short list of benefits of using TypeChain.First of all you, you will get full IDE support while writing test, meaning your editor will be able to autocomplete methods on smart contract as well as aid with parameter passing.Me looking at test source code and back at smart contract interfaceTypes will also help you find any breaking changes in your smart contracts API during migration. Another great benefit is the ability to run a more complicated static analysis, for example by using tslint ruleset TypeStrict you\u2019re able to find floating promises in your code. Promises, if not handled properly could result in tests that are passing when in reality they should fail.SummaryTypescript popularity is exploding across Javascript developers and now we have an easy way to use it in the most popular smart contract development framework. TypeChain will speed up your development speed and make your tests harder to break.Happy coding! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25PS: TypeChain became part of the newly created organization \u2014 EthereumTS.

I had never developed on Android in my life, and here I was learning on the job and delivering features for a heavily used industry application. I\u2019ll be honest in saying it was challenging at first being in a framework I was completely new to, but I quickly learned from others and got familiar with the Android framework.One of my projects was to refresh the design of our product line up gallery in the TurboTax mobile app. This helps the user select the TurboTax product that best fits their tax situation before they sign up for an account. Around this time, TurboTax Live launched and the company was adding new TurboTax products left and right.This led me to think about a dynamic solution where I could easily add another product to the lineup gallery with one line of code change. Furthermore, I wanted the gallery to be dependent on a percentage of the width and height of the phone screen so I could easily define the percentages for the multitude of screen sizes on various Android devices, including tablets. Determined to make my team\u2019s lives and my life easier with the upcoming expected product changes, I set out to take on this grand challenge.I can\u2019t tell you how many boxes I drew on a notepad to get the calculations correct. I would think I had them right, load up the app excited for it to work, and then nothing would show up on the screen! It\u2019s frustrating coding UI and nothing you coded is anywhere to be seen. On top of the calculations, I also had to ensure the animations were properly working. With my new architecture, I programmed the gallery from scratch, looking at the old gallery code every once in a while for reference.Regardless of the countless math equation changes, I figured it out after about a month and it was ready for production. Everyone was blown away and I was proud of what I accomplished.Here\u2019s where open source came in. I worked on React during a previous internship and was amazed by the ease of using open source node modules for front end web UI. I asked myself, \u201cWhy isn\u2019t this used more in Android UI?\u201d That\u2019s when I set out to open source what I had created into a library for other Android developers inside and outside of Intuit to use. I had never created an Android library before, but I thought to myself how hard can it be? I extracted the UI gallery from my code and refactored it into Kotlin (my favorite programming language) \u2014 you can learn more about my thoughts about Kotlin in another Medium post here! I also took advantage of the functional programming constructs Kotlin has to offer so my code had immutability. Both Kotlin and functional programming made my library less error prone and easier to unit test.With my mentor\u2019s advice, I created a sample app using the UI library in a different context than a product lineup, an image gallery. This really made me think through how the consumer of the library would be interacting with it and how to make that as easy as possible. I always like to put myself into the shoes of my consumer to ensure that their experience is as painless as possible, like adding proper documentation for self-help so the developer can get started right away on their own. This reflects the Customer Driven Innovation (CDI) and Design for Delight (D4D) principles that we use at Intuit to innovate.I went through the rest of the legal review and licensing, published the library to jCenter, and on March 29th, 2019, Truffle Shuffle was officially open sourced on Intuit\u2019s Github. It is also featured on Intuit\u2019s open source site alongside amazing other open source projects started by Intuit engineers.Since then, I\u2019ve had developers across the globe, from the United States to Russia to China to India, use the library and I\u2019m excited to have the worldwide developer community build on top of what I created through open source. I\u2019m proud to say that I am the first woman engineer to release an open source project for Intuit on her own and I know I will not be the last.

Since they are wild and could not be commercially cultivated people pick them with passion and eventually demand premium prices.The French gourmet Jean Anthelme Briallat-Savarin called it\u201cthe diamond of the kitchen.\u201dlet us go on a quick intro.What are truffles to start with?Botanically truffles are fungus where the truffle is the fruiting body of a subteranean( underground) fungus belonging to the genus Tuber while the Syrian truffles sometimes called desert truffles belong to the genus Terfeziaceae.Since they are ectomycorrhizal fungi they live in symposium with other plants or tree roots. They spread their spores through fungivores A.K.A. animals that eat the fungi.In Arabic it is called kemma(\u0627\u0644\u0643\u0645\u0623\u0629). It requires lightning to break the hydrogen bonds of the decomposed plant material on which it feeds. Arabs call it the daughter of lightning(\u0628\u0646\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0639\u062f) because of that and when they see a lot of lightning they say:this is a truffle year. There are 30 kinds of desert truffles some so aromatic as European species.When it grows underground you see a slight swelling of soil. locals at the desert dwellings have accumulated the needed experience to dig them as soon as possible. Since they are so pricey they rush them to the markets as soon as possible.Back then it was not so expensive and in bountiful years people would dry them(no electricity or canning available) with salt and store them for later consumption.I remember a local puzzle about it in Arabic which goes as follow:\u0647\u064a \u0628\u0646\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0631 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0628\u0631 \u062d\u0627\u0648\u064a\u0647\u0627\u0645\u0646\u063a\u0646\u063a\u0629 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u062f\u0647\u0646 \u0648\u0639\u0638\u0627\u0645 \u0645\u0627 \u0628\u064a\u0647\u0627It is the daughter of the wild and the wild is her habitat.Soaked in fat but bones has not.Today I saw these slightly peeled truffles at another shop.It is nutritious with 9% proteins,13% carbohydrates,1% fats plus minerals like phosphorus,sodium,calcium,potassium.It contains Vitamin A, B-1, B-2 plus amino acids that are vital for the body.Apparently somebody canned these brown local truffles.So here we are back. Desert is a rich habitat that awaits rain and lightning to show off her gems. When rain comes it blooms so fast as in Arabic people say \u201cdesert soil\u201d is hot(\u062d\u0627\u0631\u0629) and blooms fast.In a sense that is true but from an agronomy point of view it is the need for a fast reproduction cycle to grow and form and spread the seeds before it is dry again.

We at Polymath, deal with a large set of interconnected smart contracts. The sheer number of smart contracts cause the compilation time to go over 80 seconds on my daily driver.And adding more contracts everyday :)Lucky for us, we can make the compilation go faster.Truffle uses solc.js by default rather than native binaries for the compilation of smart contracts. solc.js offers greater portability but is significantly slower than natively compiled binaries.How much faster are the native binaries, you may ask? I managed to cut down Polymath-core\u2019s compilation time from 80 seconds to just under 15 seconds!It\u2019s that fast!Why doesn\u2019t everyone already use native binaries? Managing native binaries especially when you need to use different versions of Solidity in different projects is hard but don\u2019t sweat, we can easily use docker images as a sweet alternate solution. I\u2019ll guide you through the process.Truffle 4.X does not allow us to set a custom compiler but Truffle 5.X supports this feature. However, Truffle 5.X uses Web3 1.X while Truffle 4.X uses Web3 0.X which makes migrating to Truffle 5.X harder. We don\u2019t actually need to migrate completely to Truffle 5.X just to get faster compilation though. I\u2019ll show how we can keep using Truffle 4.X for tests and migrations while using Truffle 5.X for faster compilation.Let\u2019s start by setting up the Truffle 5.X. Later, I\u2019ll explain how we can use Truffle 5.X in conjunction with 4.X to get best of both worlds.Setting up Truffle to use Docker Image for solcFirstly, you need to install Docker. The easiest way is to follow the Instructions on https://docs.docker.com/install/#supported-platformsYou need to pull the docker image that you want to use by using the following command:docker pull ethereum/solc:0.4.25Replace the solc version with the one you need.3. Head to your project\u2019s root directory and Install truffle 5.X using:npm install truffle@next4. Edit your truffle config (present in the root directory of your project) to specify the version of solidity to use. For using docker image, you\u2019ll need to add:compilers: {  solc: {    version: \"0.4.25\",   // Change this to whatever you need    docker: true,  }}Your truffle config file should look something likemodule.exports = {  networks: {    development: {      host: 'localhost',      port: 8545,      network_id: '*'     },  },  compilers: {    solc: {      version: \"0.4.25\",        docker: true,      settings: {        optimizer: {          enabled: true,           runs: 200            }      }    }  },  mocha: {    enableTimeouts: false  }};5. Try out the new speedy compiler by executing the below command:./node_modules/.bin/truffle compileBonus: To make the command shorter, add it under scripts in your package.json like:\"scripts\": {    \"compile\": \"node_modules/.bin/truffle compile\"}and then you can directly use the command by runningnpm run compileNote: We are not directly calling truffle compile as we will be installing Truffle 4.x globally. If you want to use Truffle 5.x only then you can install it globally and directly use truffle commandsUsing Truffle 4.X along with Truffle 5.XInstall Truffle 4.X globally usingnpm install truffle -g2. Run ./node_modules/.bin/truffle compile or npm run compile before truffle test/migration commands so that you enjoy faster compilation.3. Use truffle commands normally. For example, to run tests, use:truffle testThe above command will run tests using Truffle 4.X as it is globally installed.Note: I am using paths supported by *nix systems in this article. If you are using windows, replace / with \\\\ in the paths and make any other relevant changes if required. Also, consider dual booting a Linux system for development :)Final ThoughtsSolc.js is Slow and Serious while native binaries are Fast and Furious!

Incidentally I started getting \u201cThank You\u201d emails from the service center for every time the new owner visits them.The problem lies that the CRM records were not updated and they are unaware of the new owner and the vehicle registration records are with government and Road Transport Authority(RTA) . Also the service requests are on pen & paper and does not update their CRM records. In the above there are few entities that work in isolation for the same vehicle.1)Does Blockchain apply to my scenario ?Blockchain appeals to the scenario , it adds efficiency , transparency and transformation. In above scenario multiple parties are involved and hold their version of \u201csystem of record\u201d for the same asset, their business processes does not converge or share information.2)What technology I can use for the scenario ?There are multiple blockchain platforms available , I am using Ethereum on Test/Dev node.3)How do I translate existing process into smart contracts ?A smart contract essentially represents a \u201cstate\u201d stored on blockchain with the rules of asset transfer.In the following smart contract stored and executed on Ethereum blockchain will register a new vehicle with its owner and also record any transfer of the vehicle to new owner. The vehicle service history can be retrieved which will explore in Part 2.The contract is implemented using Solidity.Solidity is a contract-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts.a.The Vehicle object is created with the vehicle information and maintains a state.struct Vehicle { bytes32 vin; string year; string model; string make; string vehicleOwner; int8 status; // 0 not exist, 1 created, 2 transferred\u2026}b.Registering the Vehicle using the VehicleManager contract takes the VIN as key identifier along with YMM and the owner of the vehicle.function registerVehicle(bytes32 _vin,string _year,string _model,string _make,string _vonwer) isOnwer(msg.sender) public{  require(!isVehicle(_vin)); vins.push(_vin); vehicleMap[_vin] = Vehicle(_vin,_year,_model, _make,_vonwer, 1);  }c.Transferring the vehicle to the new owner uses the VIN as identifier and registers the vehicle under the new owner. The vehicle status represents different states the vehicle has been .function transferVehicle(bytes32 _vin,string _voner) public isOnwer(msg.sender) returns(string) { require(isVehicle(_vin)); vehicleMap[_vin].vehicleOwner = _voner; vehicleMap[_vin].status = 2;}We will use the Remix online Solidity editor to compile and test the contract. The advantage of using Remix editor is that you can quickly deploy the contract on Javascript VM and it will create a simple Test GUI to run the functions. It also includes a debugger.As you can see the contract has been compiled and deployed (hit the create button) on Javascript VM. One can test the functions of the contract ,clicking greyed buttons one returns the getters which does not need to spend \u201cGas\u201d and peach buttons are setters that are executed for consensus on each node in the network and thus you need to spend Gas for execution on the blockchain.The full contract code can be found at github .", "responses": 1, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Truffle", "Solidity", "Tutorial", "Remix"]}, {"title": "Using Truffle framework with Arkane", "post_link": "https://medium.com/arkane-network/using-truffle-framework-with-arkane-60cef3df95bc?source=search_post", "author_name": "Karel Striegel", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@karel.striegel", "publish_date": "2018-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2018-11-23", "readtime": "2.97", "claps": 497, "voters": 15, "content": "Using Truffle framework with ArkaneKarel StriegelFollowNov 23, 2018 \u00b7 3 min readExtending the most popular blockchain development framework.Undeniably, Truffle suite \ud83c\udf6b is the most used development framework for Ethereum today. Like many of our colleagues, we use the framework to deploy and migrate our smart contracts, and a key piece in the deployment process is signing the transaction. The standard flow is to send the transaction to a web3 client, for example, a local geth or Parity node, after which the client signs the transaction and forwards it to the chain. This approach requires a sync node.\u26a0\ufe0f Spoiler alert \u2014 Demo at the bottom of the articleWeb3 ProvidersA commonly used alternative is to change the default Web3 provider by the HD Wallet provider. This extension uses a predefined mnemonic phrase to sign before forwarding it to an Ethereum node. The node can be hosted locally, internally, or even externally. Infura is an example of an external node service. A variation for the HD Wallet provider is the Ledger Wallet provider, which allows you to sign the transaction using a Ledger Nano S or Ledger Blue.While those providers have definitely increased the usability, a few issues still remain. \ud83d\udc1eAccidental pushThe provider configuration is stored in a file which lives in your code base, so the risk of an accidental commit is present, not to mention a push to a public repository on GitHub. In the case of the HD Wallet provider, it would expose your mnemonic phrase, giving anyone access to your account.Professional useAs we all know a deploy to Mainnet is not free. If you are a one-man team there is no discussion who should pay for the deployment, but if you are part of a larger team or organization, who will be responsible for the development costs? Usually, one account is created, funded by either multiple people or by the organization and the people that perform deployments get access. Now imagine one of the team members leaving. How would you revoke his access to the deployment account? The only available option is to change the account, transfer all the remaining funds and have all the developers change their configuration.Truffle Arkane Wallet ProviderCompared to other providers the Arkane Wallet provider allows you to access accounts via API keys \ud83d\udd10. You are able to create multiple keys for one wallet and revoking a key happens in just a single mouse click.Using Arkane grants you several benefits:Fine-grained access management to your deployment account, for example, one key for each developer.Easy way to revoke access if you think a key might have been compromised.It allows you to implement a security policy, where for example you change the API keys every month.And in case of a leak, it also prevents from identifying your account in any way.At the bottom of this article, you can find an animated gif where you can see the magic in action.How to add the Arkane Wallet Provider to Truffle\ud83d\ude48 If you don\u2019t yet have an Arkane wallet and an API key, let\u2019s start by creating one here.To get going you need to install the Arkane Wallet provider, which is a node package \ud83d\udce6.npm i @arkane-network/truffle-arkane-provider Then add the new provider in truffle.js and you are good to go \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\ude80.var ArkaneProvider = require(\"@arkane-network/truffle-arkane-provider\");module.exports = {  networks: {    development: {      host: \"localhost\",      port: 8545,      network_id: \"*\" // Match any network id    },    ropsten: {      provider: () =>        new ArkaneProvider({            apiKey: 'my-api-key',             baseUrl: 'https://api.arkane.network',            providerUrl: 'https://ropsten.infura.io'        }),      network_id: '3',    }  }The compilation and deployment of the smart contract is done by executing:truffle compiletruffle migration --network ropstenFor more details on the Arkane Wallet provider, you can have a look at the package on npm.arkane.network powered by fundrequest.io", "responses": 1, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Truffle", "Solidity", "Blockchain Development", "Blockchain Startup"]}, {"title": "Ethereum DApps without truffle: compile; deploy; use it :)", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@doart3/ethereum-dapps-without-truffle-compile-deploy-use-it-e6daeefcf919?source=search_post", "author_name": "Duarte Arag\u00e3o", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@doart3", "publish_date": "2016-06-14", "last_modified_date": "2018-05-15", "readtime": "6.43", "claps": 102, "voters": 16, "content": "Ethereum DApps without truffle: compile; deploy; use it :)Duarte Arag\u00e3oFollowJun 14, 2016 \u00b7 7 min readRecently I discovered Ethereum and since than I have been completely obsessed with figuring out how the whole thing works, from blockchain, to smart contracts. Although understanding the blockchain where Ethereum lies is important, there is no need for a deep knowledge on this to start doing something.Note: I might (and probably) have done some errors, or implemented some weird solutions to a very simple problem. Still this was a nice learning experience which I hope to expand more and to something better. You can get the scripts here: https://github.com/daragao/FirstEthereumExperimentdaragao/FirstEthereumExperimentFirstEthereumExperiment - This is my first experiment to understand how Ethereum works :) Something to just, compile\u2026github.comWhat should you know before starting:JavascriptWhat is a contract?What is a DApp?The first experience I had with Ethereum was to make a simple contract using truffle, the truffle generator allows you to scaffold a whole DApp project, creating a nice file structure and even providing you an example, compile smart contracts, deploy smart contracts, and use your smart contracts with JS. It is amazing! And it can be summarised into 3 main command line calls (although it has much more).truffle init: creates the scaffolding for your projecttruffle compile: compiles the smart contracts into JS filestruffle deploy: deploys the smart contracts and makes it possible to access the deployed contracts through JS callsSuper simple right?! My only issue was not knowing what the hell was happening behind the scenes. Just by thinking a bit about it is easy to get into conclusions about what is happening but still, I was missing the practice. So I decided to make 3 little scripts that just compile, deploy and use the Greeter example contract.SetupThe setup is pretty basic. We will use nodejs to execute our scripts, npm to install them, and testrpc to test the contract in a memory network (we can also use an actual private network for that).\u201cdependencies\u201d: { \u201cether-pudding\u201d: \u201c^3.0.3\u201d, \u201csolc\u201d: \u201c^0.3.4\u201d, \u201cweb3\u201d: \u201c^0.17.0-alpha\u201d }You can use package.json with these dependencies to install what you need.solc: compiles the solidity contractether-pudding: promises for web3web3: Ethereum blockchain JS api (implementation of the RPC calls made to Ethereum)ContractThe contract we will use is this one that you can get from the Greeter tutorial.Greeter.sol from https://www.ethereum.org/greeterThe contract is written in solidity, and can be compiled through the command line by the solidity compiler (although in our case we will be using a nodejs script).Compile the contractThe first step to be able to use this contract is to compile it. For that we can use this simple script, that will search for a .sol file with the same name as its argument.$> node compile_contract.js GreeterThe first part of the contract gets the .sol file depending on the argument that the nodejs script got and reads it into a string.The 3 libraries we need to achieve this are the fs from node, the solc library to compile the solidity contract, and the ether-pudding to save the compiled contract file so that we can import the Greeter object later. As you can notice, we don\u2019t need the web3 library to be able to compile anything.Unfortunately the solc compiler does not do a very complex parsing of the .sol file, so we need to remove any \\n or open comments // from the string we just got (here I am assuming the file doesn\u2019t have any // comments on it, and only removing the \\n).var solc = require(\u2018solc\u2019);var fs = require(\u2018fs\u2019);var Pudding = require(\u2018ether-pudding\u2019);//var contractName = \u2018Greeter\u2019;if(process.argv.length < 3) { console.log(\u2018needs the contract Name as argument!\u2019); process.exit(1);}var contractName = process.argv[2];var source = fs.readFileSync(__dirname+\u2019/\u2019+contractName+\u2019.sol\u2019,{encoding: \u2018utf8\u2019}).toString().replace(/\\n/g,\u2019 \u2018);The next step is to compile the contract using solc. The compilation is done by calling:var compiled = solc.compile(source, 1);if(!compiled.contracts[contractName]) { console.log(\u2018Contract must have same name as file!\u2019); process.exit(1);}Where the 1 flag is an optimization flag only.var bytecode = compiled.contracts[contractName].bytecode;var interface = compiled.contracts[contractName].interface;var contract_data = { abi: JSON.parse(interface), binary: bytecode};From the compiled JS contract object we can get our interface object, which tells us, which functions this contract has available.//interface[      {        \"constant\": false,        \"inputs\": [],        \"name\": \"kill\",        \"outputs\": [],        \"type\": \"function\"      },      {        \"constant\": true,        \"inputs\": [],        \"name\": \"greet\",        \"outputs\": [          {            \"name\": \"\",            \"type\": \"string\"          }        ],        \"type\": \"function\"      },      {        \"inputs\": [          {            \"name\": \"_greeting\",            \"type\": \"string\"          }        ],        \"type\": \"constructor\"      }    ]And our bytecode string, which is the binary representation of our contract. This is basically a set of (kind of) assembly instructions for the Ethereum Virtual Machine to execute, each time the functions in the contract are called.//bytecode\"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\"The interface and bytecode are used for ether-pudding to save a Greeter.sol.js file which serves as an API for our contract. ether-pudding gives us the great advantage of using promises in our code.Pudding.save(contract_data,\u2018./\u2019+contractName+\u2019.sol.js\u2019).then(function() { console.log(\u2018File \u2018+\u2019./\u2019+contractName+\u2019.sol.js\u2019+\u2019 was created with the JS contract!\u2019 );});DeployTo deploy out contract to the network we should use testrpc, that will create a network in memory, it is faster and simpler for us.$> node deploy_contract.js Greeter 'Hello World!'contract address: 0xe5e5978c67b6fed87bf938053094c7f8791c9e2aThe Greeter contract has a contructor that receives a string and that is the argument that we give after the Greeter filename. The response that we get from the contract is the address of the deployed contract in the network. We will use this address later to be able to interact with the deployed contract.This is the script we use to deploy the contractvar Web3 = require(\u2018web3\u2019);var web3 = new Web3();var provider = new web3.providers.HttpProvider(\u2018http://localhost:8545');web3.setProvider(provider);The web3 library is used to get the provider object. The provider is simply the node running locally to your computer, this can be a testrpc node, as it can be a proper network.if(process.argv.length < 3) { console.log(\u2018needs the contract Name as argument!\u2019); process.exit(1);}var contractName = process.argv[2];var GreeterContract = require(\u2018./\u2019+contractName+\u2019.sol.js\u2019);GreeterContract.setProvider(provider);GreeterContract.defaults({from:web3.eth.accounts[0]});var params = process.argv.slice(3,5);The first part of the deployment script, gets the contract name, and associates the contract object with the provider (our network node). Because for the deployment we need to specify a owner of the contract and to supply gas (the amount of gas you need is calculated based on the contract functions, the more complex the operations you do, the more gas you need) for it. web3 gives us a neat API to get which accounts are available to our node, the web3.eth.accounts is just an array of accounts that associated with our node. The params value is just to get 2 or less arguments for the Greeter contructor (making it 2 or less was just a random choice at the moment).GreeterContract.new.apply(GreeterContract,params).then(function(greeter) { console.log(\u2018contract address: \u2018+greeter.address);}).catch(function(err) { console.log(\u201cError creating contract!\u201d); console.log(err.stack);});The deployment after having setup the provider and owner account is just a matter of running the new function on the contract (we used apply to spread the array as arguments of the Greeter contructor, but you can ignore that) with the parameters as arguments. Because we compiled using ether-pudding we can already take advantage of promises. The promise returns then when all went alright, and catch in case of something failing.Here happens one of the magic steps from truffle: instead of finishing there, truffle gets the address where contract was deployed, stores it in the contract, and re-saves the contract (just like we did in the compile step). By doing that, truffle always knows where the last deployment was made to :)Note: Besides this, truffle also has another nice step, that is to check the contract dependencies before deploying and after deploying all the contracts dependencies before the contract itself. By not using that this script might break\u2026 although it didn\u2019t heheheUseThe final step is to use the contract we just deployed.$> node use_contract.js 0xe5e5978c67b6fed87bf938053094c7f8791c9e2acontract greeter: Hello World!As usual the first argument for node is the js script described bellow, and the second argument is the contracts address. The contract address was retrieved from the last deployment we did.On the first part of the scrip we get the web3 library to be able to setup the provider node, and the contract we want to use. After that we setup the provider in the contract and the account we wish to call functions from, this account, doesn\u2019t need to be the owner of the account.var Web3 = require('web3');var web3 = new Web3();var provider = new web3.providers.HttpProvider('http://localhost:8545');web3.setProvider(provider);// the contract name is hardcoded herevar GreeterContract = require('./Greeter.sol.js');GreeterContract.setProvider(provider);GreeterContract.defaults({from:web3.eth.accounts[1]});if(process.argv.length < 3) {    console.log('needs the contract address as argument!');    process.exit(1);}var contractAddress = process.argv[2];There is an important note: if you intend just to get a value from the contract without changing anything in the contract, there is no need to pay for gas, although if you intend to alter the contract in any way, you need to do a transaction so you need gas for that.var contractInstance = GreeterContract.at(contractAddress);contractInstance.greet.call().then(function(result) {    console.log('contract greeter: '+result);}).catch(function(err) {    console.log(\"Error creating contract!\");    console.log(err.stack);});To call a function in the contract you need to setup the contract address in the contract (in the case of truffle this is already done for you), and use the call() function of your object. call() makes sure you are calling a function and not making a transaction. If you wish to make a transaction you can just call the function normally, and a transaction will be made, as long as you provide enough gas for it.ConclusionThere is not really a conclusion here, but truffle is awesome and I intend to use it many times for my experiments, although whenever I want to make something more serious I will probably write my own scripts to be run with a normal task runner like gulp or something.Also, I am sorry the article isn\u2019t really well written, but I will do better next time.

That my friend in is what\u2019s called a \u201ccommand line interface\u201d, or CLI, or Terminal, but for us windows users, it\u2019s a command prompt \u2014 which is still used by developers.All those fancy menus are nice, but let\u2019s say they can sometimes get time-consuming, and sometimes slow us down.As such, you\u2019ll even notice that truffle and Testrpc don\u2019t use UI or User interface. In order to interact with our Dapp as we build it, we\u2019ll have to use the command prompt. Don\u2019t be scared\u2026and no this doesn\u2019t make you a hacker\u2026To get started, first find the command prompt application on your computer. After you locate it, go ahead and open it up so we can start.Command PromptSetting up your environment is fairly straight-forward. You\u2019ll need just a few things.1. Nodejs : A platform built on Chrome\u2019s JavaScript runtime for easily building fast and scalable network applications.2. Truffle : Development framework for Ethereum3. Ethereum TestRPC : A Node.js based Ethereum client for testing and development. It uses ethereumjs to simulate full client behavior and make developing Ethereum applications much faster.NodeIf you\u2019re downloading node on a windows machines, you can go to: https://nodejs.org/en/ and just click the \u201cDownload for windows\u201d button on the front page.Node installation button on websiteThen click \u201cnext\u201d all the way through the defaults and then \u201cfinished\u201d once installed. Once node is successfully installed you can open the command prompt terminal to verify that nodejs has been installed and type the following:node \u2013vPress the \u201cEnter\u201d key on your keyboard and you should see the version of node that was installed. Mine is currently v6.11.2. Do the same thing to ensure that npm (node package manager) is installed correctly also.npm \u2013versionIf you\u2019re on:\u00b7 Mac: You can download the package: https://nodejs.org/en/download/\u00b7 Linux: https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/Great that looks good, let\u2019s continue on shall we.TruffleIn the same command prompt terminal type the following:npm \u2013g install truffleEthereum TestRPCOnce again in the same command prompt window you can type the following:npm \u2013g install ethereumjs-testrpc@betaLet\u2019s do a quick check to make sure that everything is working as expected.I don\u2019t intent to dive too deep into the command prompt, but this ones on the house. There are 4 windows command prompts commands that we\u2019ll be using:1. mkdir \u2014 this is used to create a new folder2. dir \u2014 this is used to see the current files in that directory3. cd \u2014 used to change directory to the specified folder path4. cd.. \u2014 when you want to jump one folder back in the path.5. \u201ctab\u201d \u2014 This isn\u2019t really a command. If you type the first few letters of the folder you want and press the \u201ctab\u201d key on your keyboard it will autocomplete the folder name for you.Let\u2019s put those commands and tricks to good use. When you opened the command prompt you probably noticed that the path is pointing to your user account name. So in the same command prompt you had opened before, type in the following command (don\u2019t forget to press the \u201center\u201d key after you\u2019ve typed your command:cd desktopNoticed the last listed name in the path is now \u201c/desktop\u201d. Perfect! Let\u2019s speed this up a little. And then I\u2019ll quickly explain what I did.1. I created a folder called \u201cmyapp\u201d2. Then changed directory into the \u201cmyapp\u201d folder and the created another folder name \u201ctruffle_test\u201d3. After that I changed directory into the \u201ctruffle_test\u201d_ folder4. With \u201ctruffle init\u201d I told truffle to grab some files for me because this is where I\u2019ll be create my super awesome Dapp.5. And finally we took a look into the folder to see what files truffle created for usNow this is one of those times that we\u2019ll have to make a slight adjustment in order to get windows to play nicely. After you initialize truffle it creates a file called \u201ctruffle\u201d, please go ahead and rename that file to \u201ctruffle-config\u201d. Perfect! We now know that truffle works.What about that TestRCP package. Simple, open a separate command prompt (you don\u2019t need to navigate back to the folder) and just type Testrcp. If you see below, you\u2019re golden.Verify TestRPCFinal WordsWhat have we learnt?\u00b7 Command line is your friend, when it comes to Dapps\u00b7 We might have to make some adjustments every now and then if you\u2019re on windows, so bear with me please.Join the conversation, follow us on Twitter: @Tap_Coin, Reddit, or swing by and have a chat with us on Telegram: https://t.co/eIP47QmZ1E to discuss all things Tap Project.\u201cFueled by gamers, inspired by the community, disruptive to all\u201d", "responses": 4, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Development", "Blockchain", "Dapps"]}, {"title": "How to debug Solidity Smart Contracts with Tenderly and Truffle", "post_link": "https://medium.com/tenderly/how-to-debug-solidity-smart-contracts-with-tenderly-and-truffle-da995cfe098f?source=search_post", "author_name": "Bogdan Habic", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@BogdanHabic", "publish_date": "2018-11-30", "last_modified_date": "2019-08-15", "readtime": "5.61", "claps": 239, "voters": 15, "content": "How to debug Solidity Smart Contracts with Tenderly and TruffleBogdan HabicFollowNov 30, 2018 \u00b7 6 min readThe Tenderly team at Google Launchpad 2018By the end of this guide, you will be all set up with a development environment that uses Truffle and Tenderly to speed up your Smart Contract development process.What are we going to makeTo showcase the power of the Tenderly CLI we are going to make a simple calculator and use it to debug any problems we might encounter.Installing and configuring TruffleIf you already have Truffle installed and configured, you can skip to the Contract section below.To install the Truffle framework just run the following command:$ npm install -g truffleNow let\u2019s create the directory for our calculator project and initialize truffle:$ mkdir calculator$ cd calculator$ truffle initDownloading...Unpacking...Setting up...Unbox successful.

The basic installation process would be to download the latest binary from the releases page and move it somewhere in your $PATH so you can use it globally.For everyone\u2019s convenience, we have simplified the process explained above so you can install the Tenderly CLI just by running the following commands.Installing on macOSVia Homebrew:$ brew tap tenderly/tenderly$ brew install tenderlyAlternatively, via cURL (the command downloads the latest release and moves it to /usr/local/bin):$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tenderly/tenderly-cli/master/scripts/install-macos.sh | shInstalling on LinuxThe command downloads the latest release and moves it to/usr/local/bin:$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tenderly/tenderly-cli/master/scripts/install-linux.sh | shInstalling on WindowsGo to the tenderly-cli release page, download the latest version and put it somewhere in your $PATH.Using Tenderly for debuggingNow that we have the CLI all set up we can easily find why the smart contract is failing. First, we start the CLI with the proxy command which proxies requests to an Ethereum node and turns unusable errors which we saw into stack traces that we can use for easier debugging.For the sake of speed, I\u2019m going to use Ganache locally, but you can use Kovan or any other testnet if you want. You can see which options are supported by the CLI by running tenderly proxy --help:$ tenderly proxy --helpCreates a server that proxies rpc requests to Ethereum node and builds a stacktrace in case error occurs during the execution timeUsage:  tenderly proxy [flags]Flags:  -h, --help                   help for proxy      --path string            Path to the project build folder.

So let\u2019s make the ./test/calculator.js file and write out the test:We can run the truffle test --network tenderly command to see if we\u2019ve set up everything properly:You can see that we get a stack trace that gives us enough information to fix the issue.Let\u2019s add the require statement as the first line of the div function to fix our division by zero edge case:require(b > 0, \"The second parameter should be larger than 0\");And let\u2019s update our test with the assertions that assure we are seeing expected behavior:If we run our tests we should see everything is working as it should:truffle test --network ganacheUsing network 'ganache'.Compiling ./contracts/Calculator.sol...

Truffle allows developers to compile, deploy, and test smart contracts and decentralized applications all in one environment. Prior to this collaboration, the Truffle Suite of blockchain tools was only available to developers building on Ethereum.The collaboration, which will broaden Truffle\u2019s scope by integrating Truffle tools with Tezos protocols and languages, will make developing Tezos applications easier by lowering the barrier to entry and providing Tezos developers with a set of industry-leading tools in one accessible location.Truffle Suite is designed to manage blockchain developers\u2019 entire workflow, from smart contract development to front-end applications. Launched in 2015 within ConsenSys, Truffle is one of the most popular sets of developer tools in the Ethereum ecosystem based on GitHub stars, earning over three million downloads across all tools in the suite. While Truffle currently supports multiple high-level languages, Tezos is the first public, non-EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) smart contract platform to be supported in its suite of tools.Truffle plans to extend its existing features by adding support for Tezos smart contract languages and networks (Mainnet, Alphanet, and Zeronet). It will offer developers an environment for contract compilation, automated test validation, and application deployment.As part of the integration, Truffle will support Tezos through:Built-in support for Tezos networks (mainnet and test networks)Support for Michelson, LIGO, and SmartPy smart contract languagesAutomated testing frameworkTezos-specific documentation and tutorials", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Tezos", "Blockchain", "Development", "Truffle"]}, {"title": "Your First Truffle Dapp \u2014 An attempt at a beginners guide to the Truffle Framework \u2014 Part 3", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@tapdev/your-first-truffle-dapp-an-attempt-at-a-beginners-guide-to-the-truffle-framework-part-3-2c77b9feb97d?source=search_post", "author_name": "Hugh Knight", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@tapdev", "publish_date": "2017-08-19", "last_modified_date": "2018-05-06", "readtime": "6.30", "claps": 51, "voters": 14, "content": "Your First Truffle Dapp \u2014 An attempt at a beginners guide to the Truffle Framework \u2014 Part 3Hugh KnightFollowAug 19, 2017 \u00b7 7 min readSo when I sat down this week to continue our journey into developing a Dapp using truffle, I realized something. Since I\u2019m preparing this series as we go along, I\u2019m essentially shooting from the hip and I realized that we are going to need to write a Dapp in order to keep going.I\u2019m going to be honest, it\u2019s not the most world changing Dapp, and so you\u2019ll have to forgive me. With that being said, we\u2019ll need to create something simple, but yet something that allows us to explore the many features options Truffle has to offer as well as solidity\u2019s programming language.I think that one of the most common mistakes beginners make when trying to learn something is that they try to leap massive bounds without fully understanding what they need to accomplish and don\u2019t really have a clear idea of what they are trying to build. It\u2019s like going for a drive without setting a destination, sure you\u2019ll go somewhere, but you\u2019ll never actually know if you\u2019ve arrived at the right destination. You don\u2019t need to have all the answers at the beginning, but you should at least know what your end destination looks like.With this being said, I figured we would build a simple scoreboard Dapp.Our Dapp projectLike I said, nothing fancy, but it should do. I\u2019ve gone ahead and taken care of the conceptual parts of the application, so that means you don\u2019t have to worry about the css, and html, etc for now. This allows us to focus on Truffle and Solidity for the most part.To get your hands on the boilerplate application, I\u2019ve gone ahead and created a github repo that houses the initial files as well as will house the changes that we make in the future. You\u2019ll find the installation instructions in the repo as well, to download visit: https://github.com/3of5of7/scoreboardLet\u2019s have a look at some of the simple features:You have a list of names and each name is given an ID - Currently in json format, but we\u2019ll switch this to solidity using truffle.Each player is given an starting score.You can select a player by ID and increment their score by 5. We will be programming this incremental increase with truffle + solidity also.We\u2019ll create other features and flush this out later in the series.Creating Our ProjectTo create our first Dapp, we\u2019ll need to initialize our first project. A project is just a self-contained set of files that form the foundation of your project.Every Dapp is different, but will generally contain the following files:HTML and JavaScript files to create and interact with the interface.CSS files, to handle styling for your Dapp.Solidity files, to define the application logic and interact with Ethereum blockchain.Folders, to keep them nice an neatly sorted.Of course you can store other file types, like images and so forth, but we\u2019ll try and keep things as simple as possible and try to work with only what we need.Currently Truffle has a few ways to start your project. One of which is \u201ctruffle init\u201d, which will download the default files you need to create your Dapp, example contracts, migrations and test folders. The other way is using truffles new \u201ctruffle unbox [name of box]\u201d command. This will download helpful boilerplate files that allow you to get your Dapp up and running faster.At the time of this series, there are only a few Truffle boxes that you can download and it\u2019s not currently possible for developers to create their own box for others to download. So as noted above, I just put a boilerplate in a github repo for you to get started: https://github.com/3of5of7/scoreboardSince we\u2019re using windows, let click the link and download the scoreboard zip file.Using your command prompt, let\u2019s make a folder to store those files in using the following command:mkdir scoreboardThen let\u2019s extract the contents of the git repo file into our folder. Remember if your following along on windows also, change the \u2018truffle\u201d file to \u201ctruffle-config\u201d.Your folder structure should now look something like this:From the command prompt, change directory into your scoreboard folder:cd scoreboardLocal Development ServerNot all Dapps are made equal, and not all of them you can just open the \u201cindex.html\u201d file and see the dynamic information you\u2019ve brought to life.To get the Dapp working as we planned, we need to be able to have our own local server. This is a local server that we can run on our own computer. I know that it might sound a little scary, but not to worry, we have the power of our command prompt and NPM.We\u2019re going to grab an npm package called lite-server, which is just a lightweight development server that will allow us to see our changes and Dapp locally without needing a heavy duty webserver.Run the following command in our scoreboard directory:npm install lite-server --save-devNow let\u2019s go ahead and start up lite-server, by entering the following command:npm run devIf it doesn\u2019t open up your browser automatically, you can open your favorite browser and navigate to: http://localhost:3000 and we should see our scoreboard Dapp. Now we are no longer working with static files, any changes we make to our Dapp will automatically be updated to the browser with what they call \u201clive reload\u201d. Go ahead give it a try. Using your mouse, go the the \u201csrc\u201d folder and in their open \u201cusers.json\u201d file with your code editor of choice (I\u2019m a sublime text guy) and change one of the names. Save it, and then switch back to your browser and you\u2019ll notice the name is automatically update. This is great, we\u2019re taken a few steps in the right direction.To continually see the result of our future changes, we\u2019ll need to keep the local server running. That just means leaving the command prompt open going forward. You will however, need to open up another command prompt to run future commands. So that should make 3?If you do need to stop the server, just press CTRL + C on your keyboard in the local server terminal window. You may have to press it twice to fully stop the server. Then when you\u2019re ready to start the local server again just run the same command as before:npm run devJust make sure that you\u2019re in the scoreboard directory to run the command.Default Boilerplate DappAs you can see, the default application is nothing special. You\u2019ve got a list of names, which id, name & points. Then you have an input box and a button to the right. The true code behind the Dapp, hasn\u2019t been created yet, but that\u2019s where we come in.Final WordsWhat have we learnt?We can take boilerplate project files as our starting point.The command prompt can be used to quickly achieve tasks.We can initialize an empty folder with simple files by running \u201ctruffle init\u201d or download boilerplate \u201cboxes\u2019 by running \u201ctruffle unbox [name of file].How to download a local development serverTo view our Dapp on our local machine, we can use the npm run dev command.We might have to make some adjustments every now and then if you\u2019re on windows, so bear with me please.If you want to get a deeper understanding:If you haven\u2019t already, using your code editor, browse through the scoreboard Dapp files. IT doesn\u2019t do much now, or have lots, but doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t try to understand what it all does.Close the local server command prompt window, then try to navigate back to the folder and start the local server with: npm run devCreate a second Dapp folder, and try running \u201ctruffle init\u201d to see what default files it downloads for you.Join the conversation, follow us on Twitter: @Tap_Coin, Reddit, or swing by and have a chat with us on Telegram: https://t.co/eIP47QmZ1E to discuss all things Tap Project.Fueled by gamers, inspired by the community, disruptive to all", "responses": 3, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Development", "Guide", "Blockchain", "Dapps"]}, {"title": "Deploy Smart Contract with Web3js & Account Private Key, No Truffle\u2014 Solidity Tutorial 2", "post_link": "https://medium.com/coinmonks/deploy-smart-contract-with-web3js-account-private-key-no-truffle-solidity-tutorial-2-5926fface340?source=search_post", "author_name": "Francis Hor", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@francishoe", "publish_date": "2018-10-07", "last_modified_date": "2018-10-08", "readtime": "2.36", "claps": 80, "voters": 14, "content": "Deploy Smart Contract with Web3js & Account Private Key, No Truffle\u2014 Solidity Tutorial 2Francis HorFollowOct 7, 2018 \u00b7 3 min readAfter you read my Solidity Tutorial 1, you able to compile the .sol source code into JSON file in ./build/contracts/ folder.

The sample code is using the account generated from Ganache as my private test net. You can replace it with your account wallet no address and private key to deploy smart contract.let selectedHost = 'http://127.0.0.1:7545';Change selected host setting if you want to deploy to main net & test net like Ropsten.

The miner will determine priority of inserting the transaction into the next block base on gas price.In the deployContract() function, we need to retrieve the abi & byte code data from the compiled JSON file to instantiate the contract object for deployment purpose as like below// Retrieve the ABIlet abi = jsonOutput['contracts'][contract][path.parse(contract).name]['abi'];// Retrieve the byte codelet bytecode = jsonOutput['contracts'][contract][path.parse(contract).name]['evm']['bytecode']['object'];let tokenContract = web3.eth.contract(abi);After that, we will provide the byte code data to the contract object to generate the payload data to submit as a transaction.contractData = tokenContract.new.getData({  data: '0x' + bytecode});If the smart contract constructor has input parameters, you can provide the parameters like thiscontractData = tokenContract.new.getData( param1, param2, ..., {  data: '0x' + bytecode});Once the payload data is ready, it is the time we instantiate the transaction object with the payload data, gas price, gas limit & nonce. After that, we need to sign it with our private key.let rawTx = {  nonce: nonceHex,  gasPrice: gasPriceHex,  gasLimit: gasLimitHex,  data: contractData,  from: accounts[selectedAccountIndex].address};// Get the account private key, need to use it to sign the transaction later.let privateKey = new Buffer(accounts[selectedAccountIndex].key, 'hex')let tx = new Tx(rawTx);// Sign the transactiontx.sign(privateKey);let serializedTx = tx.serialize();Last step, we need to submit the signed transaction data to blockchain for contract creation/deployment.web3.eth.sendRawTransaction('0x' + serializedTx.toString('hex'), (err, hash) => {...});If sendRawTransaction() is success, it will return a transaction hash. We need to use the transaction hash to check whether the transaction is confirmed and successfully mined into a block.Once the transaction is confirmed, getTransactionReceipt() will return Receipt object which contains the new contract address.receipt = web3.eth.getTransactionReceipt(hash);...console.log('Contract address: ' + receipt.contractAddress);Hopefully this tutorial can help you understand about the alternative method of deploy smart contract without using Truffle.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Solidity", "Tutorial", "Web3", "Smart Contracts"]}, {"title": "Truffle TestRPC Accounts Can Cost Unwarry Developers Real World Ether", "post_link": "https://medium.com/coinmonks/truffle-testrpc-accounts-can-cost-unwarry-developers-real-world-ether-c314c9bc970a?source=search_post", "author_name": "Aaron Lyn Anderson", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@andersonmmi", "publish_date": "2018-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-12", "readtime": "3.75", "claps": 134, "voters": 14, "content": "Truffle TestRPC Accounts Can Cost Unwarry Developers Real World EtherAaron Lyn AndersonFollowMar 4, 2018 \u00b7 4 min readIt is common practice for DApp developers to import account keys from Truffle TestRPC to MetaMask while they are developing user interfaces that interact with their smart contracts. This is a great way to simulate user experience and work flow while developing using a testRPC or a test EVM. Unfortunately, this is also a quick and efficient way to lose real world ETH.While my team was converting a web3 enabled React component into a wordpress plugin, one of my teammates, let's call him Brian to protect the innocent, started freaking out because Etherscan.io was showing a whole bunch of transactions taking place on his Rinkeby account. It turned out he was looking at the transaction history for 0x627306090abab3a6e1400e9345bc60c78a8bef57. If that address looks familiar, that\u2019s because it\u2019s Accounts(0) when you run Truffle Develop.It never occured to any of us before that the same private keys would create the same addresses on every network. In practice we would import the private key for the address we are working with to MetaMask and assign it a name like TruffleDev0 or MewRinkeby0. Then, when we switched provider from localhost to Rinkeby Test Network, we would switch addresses as well. This is the first time one of us forgot to switch accounts in MetaMask to reflect the change in web3 provider.Here are the notes Brian wrote describing how he discovered the vulnerability:Exploit we found1. ran truffle dev2. MetaMask imported using truffle dev seed phrase or private keys3. THEN connected to networks other than local using the same MetaMask accountWhat that did:Created the same wallets (with the same private keys) on each network I connected toHow we found it:MetaMask didn\u2019t show other people\u2019s transactionsWhen we went to Etherscan, noticed a bunch of transactions we didn\u2019t initiateExploit:Everyone that runs truffle dev knows those private keysSo, when I connected to live net, every other Ethereum developer had access to real fundsHaving realised that the Truffle private keys worked on Rinkeby, we switched providers over to Main Ethereum Network and hit the \u201cView account on Etherscan\u201d button. It turns out that since the deployment of Truffle 4.0, Accounts(0) has been very active on the main net. At the time of this writing there have been 378 transactions representing about ten thousand dollars in value passing through a completely open address.We reviewed the history for all ten Truffle TestRPC addresses and discovered that they are currently being exploited by a few GETH scripts that redirect all ETH that lands at those addresses. After continued discovery we uncovered the following vulnerabilities within several popular web3 applications:By storing transaction nonce locally, MetaMask can return a transaction history that is not complete for a given address. Furthermore, it could create collisions while deploying contracts due to the nonce being estimated.Coinbase allowed the purchase of ETH by that account. In our test, we purchased 0.001 ETH from Accounts(0) and the transaction executed without any error handling. 3 blocks later, another actor had sent a portion of that ETH to another address. That target address has collected over $500 in ETH from Accounts(0) and Accounts(1) in the last 33 days.Etherscan does not have these addresses flagged in any way, nor have any comments been left by concerned citizens in the Disqus comment sections for these accounts.A Poloniex contract deposited 0.9 ETH at one point, which suggests that their interface does not prohibit their users from withdrawing to these accounts.Various accounts associated with legitimate ICOs have sent money to these accounts during their pre-sales and token sales.My company, Web3Devs, is currently in the process of raising this issue with the teams identified above so that they can flag these accounts for their customers\u2019 protection. But in the meantime we would like to offer some tips to help other developers stay safe when working with these accounts.Name your accounts in MetaMask so that you can easily see which network each account should be active on.Do not use testRPC addresses on a Test EVM as their are thousands of other transactions at those addresses which will make testing needlessly buggy.Do not store your savings or accept real payments at addresses that are stored in your development environment.Keep the funds necessary for production deployment to an absolute minimum in your development environment.Truffle 4.0 has done us all a huge favor by keeping the Accounts and seed phrases the same from one instance of Truffle TestRPC to the next. But this convenience has come with a cost. Let\u2019s all be sure to keep our teams adhering to best practices and keep addresses seperate between networks.Also, we found this contract during discovery, read the comments if you need a good laugh.", "responses": 2, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Truffle", "Testrpc", "Vulnerability", "Technology"]}, {"title": "", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@nikicarr/chocolate-truffle-cookies-cfaa734561d1?source=search_post", "author_name": "Niki Carr", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@nikicarr", "publish_date": "2017-11-01", "last_modified_date": "2018-02-26", "readtime": "3.01", "claps": 13, "voters": 2, "content": "Niki CarrFollowNov 1, 2017 \u00b7 4 min readChocolate Truffle CookiesAfter a long and hot summer, I\u2019m loving the cool fall weather that allows me to turn the oven on and bake some goodies. All the veggies are begging to be roasted and the sweets waiting to be baked. I had some yummy cocoa powder to use so I recreated the recipe for Chocolate Truffle Cookies that I got in a Scratch & Grain Cookie Kit last year (www.scratchandgrain.com). They are deliciously gooey and chocolatey, but include walnuts and flax seed so you can feel a bit healthier while eating them. I made this recipe Gluten Free and whole grain by using the Namaste Perfect Flour blend.Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.Melt 6 tbsp of butter and then add 1 tbsp of baking powder, \u00bd tbsp of vanilla powder and 1 \u00bd tsp of salt and stir until smooth.Add 3 large eggs, \u00bd cup of sugar and 2 tbsp of ground flax seed.Beat this mixture until it is light and fluffy. Baking powder is the leavening agent in this recipe. Baking powder works by releasing carbon dioxide. This gas enlarges existing bubbles in the batter, so this is the time to whip air into your ingredients.Once you\u2019re done whipping your batter, add 2/3 cup of cocoa and \u00bc cup of Gluten Free Flour blend. The baking powder reacts with acids, so chocolate is a great partner for this leavening agent.Fold the flour and cocoa in very gently, until everything is just wet. You don\u2019t want to destroy all the air bubbles you just whipped in.Next, gently fold in 2/3 cup of chocolate chips and 1/3 cup of walnuts. Don\u2019t overmix!Voila! You\u2019re batter is done.Now, grab your cookie sheets. I used a tablespoon to scoop my batter into 2 dozen balls. Leave plenty of space between them as these cookies spread out.Lastly, sprinkle some coarse finishing salt for a little crunch (plus it looks like the cookies are sparkling!).Place these little beauties into the oven. They will bake in precisely 12 minutes. If you overbake them, all the lovely air bubbles will disappear and your cookies will fall flat. While you\u2019re waiting, clean your dishes so you\u2019ll have all the time to enjoy your hard work. Here they are!They should cool for about 10 minutes before you take them from the cookie sheet.

It\u2019s written in a Pythonic way which appeals to me and as a more secure alternative to Solidity I think it has a lot of potential. I plan on writing more about working with Vyper in the future.Truffle \u2014 Too Much Of A Sweet Tooth?I\u2019ve recently finished working on a hackathon project and completed the 2018 ConsenSys Academy and during that time, for better or worse, I\u2019ve become pretty accustomed to using the Truffle development environment for writing code, testing and deploying\u2014 it just makes life easier.So, in an ideal world I\u2019d like to use Truffle for working with Vyper. After a bit of investigation I found this ERC721 Vyper implementation by Maurelian who did the work to make it Truffle compatible. I thought it might be useful to document the build process for use in other projects.How To \u2014 Vyper Development Using TruffleInstall VyperThe first step is to make sure Vyper is installed locally. If this has been done before you can skip \u2014 you can check by running the $ vyper -h command. There are various ways to install, including using PIP, the docs are here. I\u2019m using a Mac and did the following:Set up virtual environment:$ virtualenv -p python3.6 --no-site-packages ~/vyper-venvRemeber to activate the environmet:$ source ~/vyper-venv/bin/activateThen in my working dir:$ git clone https://github.com/ethereum/vyper.git$ cd vyper$ make$ make testInstall TruperNext I installed Truper, a tool written by Maurelian to compile Vyper contracts to Truffle compatible artifacts. It uses Vyper which is why we installed it previously. (See the next section for details of what it\u2019s doing). To install run:$ npm i -g truperCompiling, Testing, DeployingFrom your project dir (you can clone the ERC-721 project for a quick test).Run ganache test network:$ ganache-cliCompile any Solidity contracts as usual using:$ truffle compileCompile Vyper contracts using the command:$ truper* this must be called from the project dir and you must have the virtual environment you built Vyper in running.Truffle tests can be written and run the usual way, i.e.:Use artifacts in test files:const NFToken = artifacts.require('NFToken.vyper');Run tests using:$ truffle testTruffle migrations also work the usual way. For example I used the following migration file to deploy to ganache:2_deploy_contracts.jsconst NFToken = artifacts.require('NFToken.vyper');const TokenReceiverMockVyper = artifacts.require('NFTokenReceiverTestMock.vyper');module.exports = function(deployer) {  deployer.deploy(NFToken, [], []);  deployer.deploy(TokenReceiverMockVyper);};$ truffle migrateWhat\u2019s Going OnTruper uses Vyper which is why we installed it in the first step. If we look at https://github.com/maurelian/truper/blob/master/index.js we can see Truper is creating Truffle artifact files for each Vyper contract and writing them to the ./build/contracts folder of the project.Truffle Artifact FilesThese *.json files contain descriptions of their respective smart contracts. The description includes:Contract nameContract ABI (Application Binary Interface \u2014 a list of all the functions in the smart contracts along with their parameters and return values). Created by Truper using: $ vyper -f json file.vyContract bytecode (compiled contract data).

The latest version of solidity essentially meant that all your smart contracts are now broken. It all seemed ok though; just a couple day\u2019s work to get caught up. Then, just before Christmas came Truffle 5 with support for solidity 0.5 and web3 beta, and guess what? Now all your tests and migrations are broken as well. Happy holidays!I\u2019ll try to list the challenges we came across while upgrading and how we solved them. I hope that this will help other devs save some time while upgrading their Solidity/Truffle projects.The whole ethereum ecosystem and developer tools are in a nascent stage, but at least they were somewhat explored and tested. They were like known unknowns. The latest updates, on the other hand, felt like unknown unknowns.How it felt after updating truffleWe started fixing all the syntax errors, incompatibilities and whatnots one by one. Just like how little drops of water make the mighty ocean, our small-small fixes made the refactored code a reality. We have done all these changes in the dev-3.0.0 branch of Polymath-core.The first task was to set up our work environments to work with both older tools and newer tools. We did this by installing Truffle 4 globally while installing Truffle 5 locally. We also had to update our truffle-config.js accordingly. You may read more about this in my previous blog post about compiling smart contracts faster using native solc.The next challenge was to refactor our Solidity 0.4.24 code to work with solidity 0.5.X. There are quite a few breaking changes in Solidity 0.5 that are mentioned in the official docs. As you may have noticed, most of the required modifications are due to the new explicitness requirements. Most of these changes can be done automatically, so we decided to create an AI (a few if-else statements) that does most of the work for us.Artificial Intelligence!The refactoring tool was mentioned in a week in ethereum edition, and you should try it on your projects. More details about its features and usage instructions are available on GitHub. It is essentially a plugin for the famous code formatter, prettier, that refactors Solidity 0.4.X syntax to Solidity 0.5.X syntax while beautifying your code.There are limitations to what a tool can do (mentioned on GitHub), and we had to make a few changes manually as well. For example, we had to write a new function to extract the function signature from bytes data as the earlier version used a casting that is no longer allowed.Now that we had our contracts compiling with Solidity 0.5, we had to make them work on our CI as well. To simplify this, we created a docker image which had everything we need pre-installed. You can grab it from docker hub and use it in your projects. The Dockerfile is available on GitHub if you want to customize the image. Feel free to pick a thing or two from our CircleCI config on GitHub.So we now have our CI running to remind us that all our migrations and tests are broken. Truffle 5 uses web3 1.0 beta rather than web3 0.20 that Truffle 4 uses. The main changes in web3 1.0 are that it uses BN.js instead of BigNumber.js and it has a lot more going on with promises. We started refactoring our migrations for the latest version of web3 but soon came across a bug that breaks web3 when using huge numbers. A workaround is to use an older version of web3 like 1.0.0-beta.35.Refactoring our test cases and migration scripts was a long and tedious task that took us days to complete. We have some tips for you that may help speed up the process:Use regex. You can search and replace a lot of old syntax to new syntax by using patterns detected by regex.BN can be converted to a string using toString() . This will help you assert conditions on BNs. You may also use bn-chai.You can not directly add numbers to BN. You\u2019ll need to convert the number to BN and then use add method of BN. Same applies for other mathematical operations.You need to pass full addresses of ethereum accounts now rather than just partial like 0x0.You need to convert ASCII to Hex before passing it in bytes datatype. web3 does not automatically convert it anymore.Loading contract instance in truffle using .at now returns a promise so you need to use await or handle the promise.After days, we finally had all our migrations and tests working as expected. You\u2019d think that everything is working now, but no\u2026 there\u2019s more stuff to do. solidity-coverage does not support Solidity 0.5. The main problem was that the parser wasn\u2019t updated to support the latest Solidity version. The community came through on this one, and with a combined effort, we were able to fix solidity-coverage unofficially. More info on this GitHub Issue.You can mostly fix it by using the updated parser. To fetch the updated parser, use:curl -o node_modules/solidity-parser-sc/build/parser.js https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maxsam4/solidity-parser/solidity-0.5/build/parser.jsFeel free to fork my repo so that you can download it from your repo directly. You\u2019ll need to replace this file every time you add an npm module. You\u2019ll also need to make it a part of your CI if you run coverage on your CI.We finally had everything working! Or did we?When you think you are done but\u2026During the days we were refactoring the code, we were also working on the older code to fix bugs/add features. Now, we\u2019re in the process of solving the gazillion merge conflicts it created.As we were one of the first teams trying out the tools against Solidity 0.5, we came across numerous bugs among various tools. We created pull requests to fix a few of them in tools like solidity-coverage, solidity-parser, solidity-parser-antlr, prettier-plugin-solidity, and solidity-docgen. A lot of other bugs in other tools were fixed by their respective maintainers. Most of the developer tools are now considerably more polished than when we started refactoring our code.We hope that it will be a bit easier for you to update your smart contract code, tests, and deployment scripts now.

These two shells provide features far beyond the standard Command Prompt, and will make your life on the command line much easier.Non-WindowsLet\u2019s install Testrpc.Testrpc is a Node.js based Ethereum client for testing and development. It uses Ethereumjs to simulate full client behavior and make developing Ethereum applications much faster. It also includes all popular RPC functions and features (like events) and can be run deterministically to make development a breeze.$ npm install -g ethereumjs-testrpc$ testrpcNow, while Testrpc is running in a brand new terminal, we can go ahead and install Truffle, initialize and app and run it.$ npm install -g truffle$ cd ~/Desktop$ mkdir truftest$ cd truftest$ truffle unbox reactHere we are using a shortcut truffle unbox react which does an initialization and adds the necessary modules for react. If you want to have a pure installation you should instead run truffle init inside of the folder you created.Go into your Truffle folder.$ cd ~/Desktop/truftest$ truffle compile$ truffle migrate$ npm startThese commands will migrate the current contracts into testrpc. Now, when your app starts, head over to localhost:3000 and you should see this screen:SolidityLet\u2019s mess around with the Solidity contract. We are going to be making a contract called MySale. truftest/contracts/MySale.sol$ truffle create contract MySaleNow we have to add a migration file for deploying this contract to the EVM. Create a file called truftest/migrations/3_add_Sale.jsNote that the filename is prefixed with a number and is suffixed by a description. The numbered prefix is required in order to record whether the migration ran successfully. The suffix is purely for human readability and comprehension.Okay, let\u2019s fill out the migration.var MySale = artifacts.require(\"./MySale.sol\");module.exports = function(deployer) {  deployer.deploy(MySale);};Now you will be provided with a Solidity file with no functions. I went ahead and filled it in with 3 rudimentary functions. truftest/contracts/MySale.solpragma solidity ^0.4.4;contract MySale {  mapping(address => uint) balance;  uint total_coins = 1;  function printCoin(uint howMuch) public{  \tbalance[msg.sender] += howMuch;  \ttotal_coins += howMuch;  }  function allCoins() constant public returns(uint){  \treturn total_coins;  }    function myCoin() constant public returns(uint){   return balance[msg.sender];  }}Now, let\u2019s go ahead and make our app have a touch event to trigger both a get and a set function from that contract.Go to truftest/src/App.js and add this.import React, { Component } from 'react'import MySale from '../build/contracts/MySale.json'import getWeb3 from './utils/getWeb3'import './css/oswald.css'import './css/open-sans.css'import './css/pure-min.css'import './App.css'const contract = require('truffle-contract')const mySale = contract(MySale)class App extends Component {  constructor(props) {    super(props)    this.state = {      storageValue: 0,      web3: null    }  }  componentWillMount() {    getWeb3    .then(results => {      this.setState({        web3: results.web3      })    })    .catch(() => {      console.log('Error finding web3.')    })  }  coinCount(){    mySale.setProvider(this.state.web3.currentProvider)    var mySaleInstance    console.log(\"...getting data\");    this.state.web3.eth.getAccounts((error, accounts) => {      mySale.deployed().then((instance) => {        mySaleInstance = instance        return mySaleInstance.allCoins.call({from: accounts[0]})      }).then((result) => {        console.log(\"result\", result);      })    })  }  printCoin(){    mySale.setProvider(this.state.web3.currentProvider)    var mySaleInstance    console.log(\"...setting data\");    this.state.web3.eth.getAccounts((error, accounts) => {      mySale.deployed().then((instance) => {        mySaleInstance = instance        return mySaleInstance.printCoin(4, {from: accounts[0]})      }).then((result) => {        console.log(\"result\", result);      })    })  }  render() {    return (      <div>        <div id=\"get\" onClick={this.coinCount.bind(this)}></div>        <div id=\"set\" onClick={this.printCoin.bind(this)}></div>      </div>    );  }}export default AppI added some CSS to #get and #set so I can see those div\u2019s. You can find this in truftest/src/App.css#set{  height:50px;  width:50px;  background-color:red;  float:left;  margin: 20px;  cursor: pointer;}#get{  height:50px;  width:50px;  background-color:blue;  float:left;  margin: 20px;  cursor: pointer;}What we get is two boxes that when clicked execute our contract and console.log the result. But what if we didn\u2019t want to run the app inside of Testrpc? For that we will need Mist and Rinkeby. Rinkeby is the test EVM.

In this tutorial I\u2019ll take things a little further by demonstrating a couple of interactions with the contract, and going through an example with the Truffle debugger.Make sure that you\u2019ve followed through the steps in part 1. At the end of that tutorial, we had shown how to deploy and test a contract, but hadn\u2019t really done much with it yet.Open up VS Code, and open the console again with Ctrl+\u2019. In the console, enter one after the other:truffle developmigrate --resettestThese steps will take us back to the place that we left off in the previous tutorial, showing the contracts are deployed, and that the five tests have passed.Getting started with Web3Web3 is a JavaScript library that allows interactions with smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain (or test chains). It comes bundled into the Truffle development console, and so is available to use to interact with the contracts that have been deployed.When the Truffle development console is started, it automatically configures 10 addresses, and assigns each of the addresses 1000 test Eth to get going with. You can check the ten available addresses by entering:web3.eth.accountsThis will return an array of the available addresses. Note that these are the addresses that were displayed when entering the Truffle development console.You can pick out individual elements in the array in the usual way:You can check the balance of each address in fake-Eth by typing:web3.eth.getBalance(web3.eth.accounts[1]).toNumber() * 10e-18;Note, that the getBalance call returns the value in Wei, so convert to Eth.The full web3 capabilities are described here.Interacting with the contractSo far we have compiled, deployed, and tested the MetaCoin example, but we have barely even looked at the actual code, let alone interacted with it.Lets take a quick look at the code, and think about a couple of interactions that may be useful.As you can see, there are four functions available. They are:MetaCoin, the constructor. Called when the contract is deployed.sendCoin, for transferring coins between addresses.getBalanceInEth, to convert between MetaCoins, and Ethereum.getBalance, to show the balance in the requested address.The concept of constructors is of course well understood to anyone familiar with object orientated programming, but its use in blockchain coding is a little less obvious. The constructor is called only once, and this is when the contract is deployed to the blockchain. In these examples, that is when the truffle command migrate is called. Deploying a contract to a blockchain is analogous to calling \u2018new\u2019 in traditional OO coding, and so once deployed, the constructor cannot be called again.Inspecting the code in the constructor shows only a single line:balances[tx.origin] = 10000;This sets the balance of the address which has initiated the transaction to 10000 MetaCoin. Note, this is the balance in MeteCoin, not Eth, which will remain \u20181000\u2019. In these examples, the initiating address is the one found at:web3.eth.accounts[0]This can be shown by inspecting the balance at that address by entering:MetaCoin.deployed().then(function(instance){return instance.getBalance.call(web3.eth.accounts[0]);}).then(function(value){return value.toNumber()});The balance at account[0] is shown to contain 10000 MetaCoins, as per the value set in the constructor.The function \u2018sendCoin\u2019 can be used to move the coins around between accounts. Note that the sender in this case is accounts[0], and we are sending the balance to accounts[1].MetaCoin.deployed().then(function(instance){return instance.sendCoin(web3.eth.accounts[1], 100);});The transaction can be shown to be successful by checking the balance of both accounts. Note that this is the MetaCoin balance, NOT the Eth balance:MetaCoin.deployed().then(function(instance){return instance.getBalance.call(web3.eth.accounts[0]);}).then(function(value){return value.toNumber()});MetaCoin.deployed().then(function(instance){return instance.getBalance.call(web3.eth.accounts[1]);}).then(function(value){return value.toNumber()});We have used the Truffle development console, and the Web3 libraries to deploy and interact with the contract. Next, we\u2019ll look into the actual execution of the function, by starting the Truffle debugger, and stepping through the code line by line.Debugging the TransactionThe final piece of the Truffle-puzzle that I want to demonstrate, is the Truffle debugger.In the above examples, a call was placed to the sendCoin() function, which resulted in a transaction occurring on the blockchain. This transaction can be stepped through line by line, using the Truffle debugger. To do this the Truffle debug command is used, passing in the transactionHash. This can be found in the console output following the sendCoin function call. Note that your transaction hash will differ from mine.Copy the transaction hash and enter the Truffle debugging environment with:debug YOUR_TRANSACTION_HASHThis will start the Truffle debugger. The instructions for interacting with the debugger are printed to the console:You should start by adding a watch to the passed variables. do this by entering:+: receiver+: amountAs you step through the code, the values passed into the function will be shown. Note, these are \u2018undefined\u2019 at the start of the function call.You can hit enter a few times to step through the code that was executed in this transaction.The debug commands can be used to inspect the variables, and add watched variablesThe experience debugging with Truffle is not quite as \u2018rich\u2019 an experience as you may be used to, say coming from a .NET background. But, it\u2019s still a fantastic tool to use to make your life significantly easier when writing your contracts.What\u2019s Next?Part one of this series described some basic environmental setup. In this tutorial, we have interacted with the MetaCoin contract, and worked through a transaction with the debugger. However, all of this has been carried out against the build in Truffle \u2018fake\u2019 blockchain. In the next post, I\u2019ll go though the alternative, and more \u2018realistic\u2019 test environments.I am currently working on EdgeFund, an open-source platform which offers a decentralised shared bankroll on the Blockchain.

I recently learned how to do it the hard way, bashing my head against the wall, so I wrote this article to spare you the hassle.I will further assume that:Your testing framework is Truffle, Ganache + Mocha.You want to your tests to be as accurate as possible (<5 seconds error margin).Manipulating time in tests written for Ethereum smart contracts comes with some gotchas.Gotcha #1: RPCWhile it is totally possible to jump forwards and backwards in time in Ganache, there are multiple ways to achieve this. To get accurate results, you must use the evm_mine RPC method in the following way:Also as a promise in javascript:Notes:Without the NUMBER_OF_SECONDS parameter, the RPC call increases only the block height but doesn\u2019t jump in time.The \u201cid\u201d parameter is optional but good to have. It doesn\u2019t really matter what value you put in there while testing.There is also evm_increaseTime, which increases the \u201cinternal clock\u201d of Ganache so that whenever the next block is mined it has a timestamp offset. This adds overhead though:That\u2019s right, you\u2019d have to make two RPC calls, compared to only one with the first approach.Props to Jakub Wojciechowski for coming up with PR #13 for ganache-core. It would\u2019ve been hard to write accurate tests without a deterministic and atomic way to jump in time in Ganache.Gotcha #2: Run TimeCode itself takes time to execute. Specifically, javascript promises take a non-negligible amount of time to resolve.This is obvious, right? When writing time-dependent tests for Ethereum smart contracts, things get delicate.Consider the following:The time it takes for the test case to runThe amount of seconds you want to jump in the futureThe unix timestamp for the moment when you submit yarn run test in your consoleContingent on these variables, your test block may get caught in between the passage of one or more seconds, hence your assertions may break.For instance:What this does is that it calls the Sablier contract to withdraw a previously deposited wad of money. The rules that dictate how much the caller can withdraw are specified in ERC-1620.I expected the test to pass consistently, but I was wrong. So wrong. It started to break ~1 in 8 times and the thing I feared most happened, that is, non-deterministic variance.I logged the unix timestamp in mocha\u2019s before block and I measured how long it takes for the test to run using node\u2019s performance timing api:If you add 115 to 1565455128964, you end up with a number that ends with 9079, thus the number of seconds increases from 8 to 9. This is what broke the assertion, because I was expecting a balance of x, when I was actually getting x + 1 (more seconds passed = more money).While it\u2019s impossible to write a program P1 that can compute how long it takes for another program P2 to finish (see Turing\u2019s Halting Problem), we could safely assume that no more than 1 second should pass between your beforeEach and it blocks. This is assuming the back and forth communication between your node instance and ganache is almost instantaneous, even when running coverage.Here\u2019s the fix:Where ONE_UNIT is one monetary unit allocated per second, as per the Sablier model. It is imperfect, but way better than using a \u201cgreater than\u201d or \u201cless than\u201d equality check.Finally, as the OpenZeppelin team argues here, you might not need this level of precision. If your dapp doesn\u2019t involve timestamps or block numbers directly, tolerating larger chronological offsets is perfectly fine. Nonetheless, it\u2019s good to be aware of run time.Gotcha #3: BeforeEach and AfterEachYour mileage may vary, but you may want to jump forwards in \u201cbeforeEach\u201d and jump backwards in \u201cafterEach\u201d. This is because your contract might have some variables defined in the scope of the \u201cdescribe\u201d block and you want to run a sequential set of \u201cit\u201d blocks that all assume the same state. Not reverting back in \u201cafterEach\u201d would only increase the timestamp forever.Example:As you can see in the snippet above, we have three tests in which we assume the amount withdrawn is 5. In the context of Sablier, advancing in time 15 seconds would yield a withdrawable amount of 15, thus we have to go back to the original state in the \u201cafterEach\u201d block.Gotcha #4: SnapshotsWhile truffle provides its own clean-room environment, it\u2019s not a bad idea to implement your own snapshotting mechanism. That is, going back to the original state after all tests are done. It may be helpful for CI or other external environments.Define those functions in your codebase and then insert his in one of your root test files:Voil\u00e0, now your blockchain will revert to its original timestamp after all magical time jumpings.Wrap UpSome of the bits and pieces used throughout this article are inspired or taken from other writings, such as Ethan Wessel\u2019s amazing Standing the Time of Test with Truffle. \u0336T\u0336h\u0336e\u0336 \u0336o\u0336n\u0336l\u0336y\u0336 \u0336c\u0336a\u0336v\u0336e\u0336a\u0336t\u0336 \u0336w\u0336i\u0336t\u0336h\u0336 \u0336t\u0336h\u0336a\u0336t\u0336 \u0336a\u0336r\u0336t\u0336i\u0336c\u0336l\u0336e\u0336 \u0336i\u0336s\u0336 \u0336t\u0336h\u0336e\u0336 \u0336u\u0336s\u0336a\u0336g\u0336e\u0336 \u0336o\u0336f\u0336 \u0336b\u0336o\u0336t\u0336h\u0336 \u0336e\u0336v\u0336m\u0336_\u0336m\u0336i\u0336n\u0336e\u0336 \u0336a\u0336n\u0336d\u0336 \u0336e\u0336v\u0336m\u0336_\u0336i\u0336n\u0336c\u0336r\u0336e\u0336a\u0336s\u0336e\u0336T\u0336i\u0336m\u0336e\u0336,\u0336 \u0336a\u0336n\u0336d\u0336 \u0336w\u0336e\u0336 \u0336e\u0336x\u0336p\u0336l\u0336a\u0336i\u0336n\u0336e\u0336d\u0336 \u0336a\u0336b\u0336o\u0336v\u0336e\u0336 \u0336w\u0336h\u0336y\u0336 \u0336t\u0336h\u0336i\u0336s\u0336 \u0336i\u0336s\u0336 \u0336n\u0336o\u0336t\u0336 \u0336i\u0336d\u0336e\u0336a\u0336l\u0336.\u0336Update: Ethan was really cool and he updated his post and ganache-time-traveler package with a few methods that use evm_mine as indicated in his article.Also, here\u2019s a very good StackExchange thread on the inherent security of block.timestamp and some GitHub threads that shed some light on the history of deterministic time jumping in Ganache (1 and 2).Thanks for reading!

The sense memory of them did, anyway. You know how it is with association, well, that made me think of sex, wait, no, not exactly sex, what was it, maybe rutting animals. Following my nose further led to rich discoveries in the local life around the black truffles of Perigord.They became a metaphor for my own romantic involvement with the culture and landscape of southwest France. I was smitten the moment I landed in the comforting, ancient hills for I thought would be a nine-month fling. The taste turned to commitment, however, and I decided to move here for good. The love affair grows with each experience, and I wake up each day wanting more.This particular incident began on a cold, misty Wednesday in January. Around here, in the rural Dordogne department, there\u2019s always a buzz about mushrooms. Even the roadways are dotted with giant wooden champignons. The c\u00eapes of autumn aren\u2019t the topic of discussion in winter though. It\u2019s truffles, specifically, tuber melanosporum, the black truffle of Perigord. Elusive in the wild, expensive in the markets, and elegant in haute cuisine, it\u2019s in fact, a fungus that grows in the roots of trees, mostly oak and hazelnut trees. I kept hearing talk, and saw signs taped in storefront windows, \u201cFor truffles, call\u2026\u201d The Wednesday wholesale market was where I started down this truffling trail, which led to farms, and then to forests. Sometimes you begin a story in the middle.Sarlat, a postcard-perfect medieval town in Dordogne, near the famous Lascaux caves, is the first and smaller wholesale market I visited. At precisely 2 p.m. in the town square, the bell announces the opening of business. The cordon is pulled aside and buyers are permitted to approach the six sellers, in what turns out is a well-understood dance step. Each man selling truffles has a small basket in front of him. Inside, nestling in a heavy dishcloth, are his black nuggets. They range in size from malted milkballs to small muffins. They\u2019re lumpy, black, almost hard, that is, not spongy. I recognize one of the lookers, a market vendor, because he is a handsome character I notice each week at his produce stand. He smells like an animal, I think as he passes by me. Wait, it is not him, it is the truffles. There goes that association thing.The rest of the buyers, hard-eyed and well-groomed, wear black leather jackets. They lean in towards each basket, peering in, then on to the next one. They return to one, and with a nod from the seller, lift a truffle to the nose. A side note here about sniffing in France \u2014 it is perfectly acceptable, normale, to sniff truffles and produce, but do not sniff the hot dish the chef has just presented you, before chowing down \u2014 what\u2019s the matter, you question its freshness?If the truffle sniff passes muster, then bantering begins, fraternal on the surface, but underneath, the questions gauge the supplier\u2019s desperation. The buyer and seller look each other in the eye, step aside briefly, whisper, then lightly graze knuckles. That\u2019s it. The bell rings shortly after, and the market is over for the day. The couple approaches the official scale, to confirm the weight of the product, and folded bills change hands. The public price that day was around \u20ac900 per kilo for top quality truffles.Hooked on this intimate and foreign business I had observed, I returned to le march\u00e9 controll\u00e9, the retail market where smaller quantities are sold to individuals. The controlled aspect refers to the examination the truffles must pass before being sold. The Truffle Association handles this, so that quality and authenticity can be assured to the ordinary buyer. It\u2019s in the interest of truffle sellers to be members, because it is by guarding the quality of the merchandise, that the reputation and price remain top-notch. That truffle oil you bought on sale probably did not originate here.It was in the small exposition room, where I began to understand the power of the odor. Warm bodies, and the heat of expectation lifted and expanded the smell molecules. My interest was aroused again. More sellers this time, keen to make some money on the side, were mostly friendly to potential customers, as one would expect in a room full of competitors. I headed towards the smilers.The vendor was glad to see me, and told me all about American states and politics, the warm-up banter. A lively conversation among his friends erupted about how they prepare the truffles. It is generally agreed that the black Perigord truffles should not be cooked, but added in tiny quantities to warm, or cooked, neutral bases, like bread, eggs, or pasta. Those molecules that had expanded to fill the room, can also shrink so small, they will penetrate an eggshell, so many people store their truffle in a plastic container overnight (one night only, or they will rot) with eggs destined for a gentle scrambling in a double-boiler in the morning.A couple of giant truffles changed hands right next to me. A chemist shelled out \u20ac800 for the biggest, plus a basketful of others. She uses them to \u201cartificially inseminate\u201d oak seedlings to sell for cultivation.I bought my first truffle, a trifle, for \u20ac15. Returning to my car, I passed through a couple boutiques, sure the shop girls wondered what I had been up to, from my satisfied grin, to those pungent molecules emanating from my pocket. Saturday night was indulgent, with the slivers of truffle on warm baguettes with salted butter, a flute of champagne, and a sense that there was more to uncover.The next week at the Lalbenque wholesale truffle market, in the department of the Lot, this otherwise shabby town fills with commotion, as it is world famous for being the real thing. Buyers in impeccable tweeds did the same dance as I had seen the week before. This time, forty or so sellers stood on one side of the makeshift counter, and when the market officially started were approached by hundreds of buyers. The truffles weren\u2019t as impeccably clean as at the small market \u2014 perhaps one gets just a little more money by selling dirt. The same whispered agreements followed the inspections. This time, because of the sheer volume of transactions, the buyer is given a handwritten card by the named seller, with the specified quantity purchased.At the end of the market, all the parties rush on one single scale, manned by the head of the truffle association. The vendor presents truffles, and if the weight agrees with the card, the buyer pays up. Only the two of them know the price. I was baffled, therefore, when I saw pricing statistics on the Lalbenque website. Mysteries abound.The other question is taxes. When I asked an official looking man about this, I received a familiar look, the one that wonders what kind of idiot I am, and he answered, \u201cBut no, they have already paid taxes on their land, they do not have to pay taxes again.\u201d So, France avoids even attempting to tax what could be a lucrative revenue source. Property taxes in this country are extremely low compared to the US, so I am left to wonder why France, which seemingly taxes everything, would turn its head on this matter, perhaps to avoid a populist revolution.In Italy, home of the white truffles that are five times more expensive than those around here, the chase for tax revenues appears to be mostly a serial comedy, with no result expected or rendered. The secret trade in white truffles from Croatia further complicates play among the Italians. Truffles resist taxation, no matter where they come from. Country people know a thing or two about this game.Speaking of country folk, after the impressive wholesale market, replete with gastronomic \u201cpoppers\u201d, mouth-sized breaded morsels of oozing foie gras, tickled with truffles, a pig show was offered. Pigs are no longer used for truffle hunting because they eat the truffles, and are expensive to feed and keep. However, the town of Lalbenque understands the rustic charm of truffle-hunting pigs, and has contracted with a gentleman to show tourists how pigs work. With his porker on a leash, he led the group to the grove where he had hidden some practice truffles. The pig found them, the man rescued the nuggets, and the pig was rewarded with\u2026 dry cat food.This little pig was bought in early November, did her basic training immediately, and began earning her keep in mid December. Her career will be short, and sometime in late February, she will be served for dinner. Country living is both intimate and hard-nosed.Yes, truffles are a part of the traditional culture of southwest France, and they are also big business. This would become abundantly clear the following weekend at the Truffle Festival in Sarlat. Another side note, there are so many \u2014 I asked a group of interesting French people whether this part of France is considered the \u201cheart of French country cooking.\u201d The idiot look again, then, \u201cNon, non, non,\u201d they resounded, practically in unison. They agreed that people in the southwest \u201creally know how to eat.\u201d but they went on to clarify that each region has its specialty, and that one seeks out, for instance,not just cassoulet, but cassoulet from Castelnaudary, or Carcassonne, or Toulouse. If you have a long afternoon, for instance, start a conversation about cheeses; almost always, cheeses are referred to with their place names intact.So, the black truffles of Perigord were being celebrated on every street corner of Sarlat, along with companion competitions of foie gras cooking involving hundreds of chefs, and samplings of Bergerac wines, much of it promoted by the tourism industry of the region. Gastronomy is a huge part of the region\u2019s identity.One of the many interesting offerings that weekend was a visit to a trufficulteur. Monsieur Blanc, handsome with his canvas coat, rugged features, and pronounced patois, explained how to attempt cultivating truffles, attempt being the operative word. The frost and fog clung to the slope as we followed him and his Lagotto Romagnolo up the hill. I had recently been enquiring about the purchase of this Italian breed, because it\u2019s hypoallergenic and smart. Perhaps it could earn me some tax-free money, too. Back to the truffles.Growing requirements of truffles are specific, while the output is capricious. The soil must be a combination of limestone and clay, well-drained, but not dry. The tree roots must extend wide, rather than deep, so the tree is pruned hard, and sometimes even the roots, to encourage spread. He and his wife are experimenting with companion plantings of lavandin, a scrub version of lavender, the roots of which retain moisture in dry landscapes.Truffle spores depend on a wet May and June to spawn. The summer must be evenly warm while they are in their nursery stage. Rains in August are vital for the adolescent tuber that does almost its entire growth at one time. The last seasonal factor for success is no early frosts in December. He plants green oaks, bought from the chemist I\u2019d seen at the market, but does not expect any truffle appearance for at least five years. This is an occupation for people with patience and money, I could see.What do you know, the dog sniffed one underground, and the gentleman worked the nugget out with his tool. The perfumed black Perigord truffle is firm, darkest brown, the skin does not flake when scratched, and inside it displays a filigree of fine white veins when ripe. If any of these factors appear off, it may be the lesser and stinky brumale, or unripe, or, gasp, Chinese. This one appeared to have been fully, truly in the ground, but, well, the timing and location were perfect for demonstration purposes. Presto, in his hand, a \u20ac50 black magic nugget.In fact, the whole festival was beautifully orchestrated to showcase the fragrant fungus that brings fame and fortune to Perigord.\u201cMeet me at the crossroads on the way to the abbey,\u201d Jean Louis said to me on the phone, later that week. So, there I was at a crossroad; literally, a cross stood there. Did you know that these crosses one sees in rural France, erected by Louis XIV\u2019s road workers, (For more on French country roads, read Graham Robb, The Discovery of France) often mark Roman roads that were, and are, still in use? That wasn\u2019t all. On this same road that leads to the abbey, founded in 1115 (!), I stopped for a couple minutes at a rough wooden arrow pointing to a dolmen, a Celtic burial site. Sure enough, a hundred meters down the path, a mound of earth was topped with a tunnel of stones leading to a portal marked by a mammoth horizontal lintel stone. In this short length of road, so much history lies everywhere. This pays, this layered landscape, promises a lifetime of interest to me. The rare January sunshine warmed my face, as I waited at a crossroad for a man and a dog. It sounded like the beginning of a good song. Oh right, back to the truffle hunting.When we sat down at his kitchen table, I asked him if he was born here, thinking he might answer yes, he was from the Dordogne. He answered, \u201cYes, in that house over there,\u201d pointing to a crumbled farmhouse down the hill. Clearly, I would be getting truly local insights that day. He spent half an hour explaining truffle lifecycles, and soil requirements, then he showed me how he works with his dog. The golden retriever wagged, announcing the good times had begun.Jean Louis hid a couple of perforated film canisters around the yard, and then invited the dog and I out. He instructed the animal to go find them. Inside the containers are old bits of training truffles, the crumbled parts not suitable for cuisine. Each time Bilou found one, he was rewarded with a bit of bread. Apparently, he loves bread. With his hint of what was to come, the dog jumped in the back of the twenty-year-old car, and off we went to look for wild truffles. I was warned not to expect anything, as the heat spikes in the summer had killed the juvenile fungus. This is a great approach to life in general, I thought \u2014 keep expectations low, and jump for joy when luck strikes.The slope where we looked was perfect, Jean Louis said, because it faced south, and had just the right mix of limestone and clay, a Ph of 8 to be specific, that truffles like best. Although it\u2019s private property, the owner allows him to hunt there because he had cut up a lot of fallen trees for free in a huge storm some years ago. Relationships matter in this small world.We moved up the hill \u2019til he pointed out a clearing where the tall grass did not grow. Truffles leave a burnt look around the trees they infect and inhabit. The dark circle should be twice as large as the canopy of the tree, because the root system, the truffle\u2019s home, extends that far. Then, once the burnt area has been spied, the truffle hunter takes a small twig to wave above the sedum and mosses that hold moisture underneath. He is hoping to rustle up the particular flies that are attracted to the truffle odor.As he moved over the small patch of ground, he piped in, \u201cI once found a huge one under this rock. Then, another year I noticed the soil around it had been scratched. It was hunters, not an animal. I could tell.\u201d As he kept moving, I marveled how he remembered specific incidents and the exact truffle he found, all in a circle about fifty feet wide. This would not be a day for such a discovery, though.The three of us headed to a small parcel that Jean Louis owns where he is attempting trufficulture. Remember, one does not plant truffles, one plants trees that have been implanted with the truffle fungus. It is a long term wager, with uncertain results. Thinking back to the taxation comment in Lalbenque, one does not want the tax man, who thinks in absolutes, to believe one is a truffle farmer. Why? The taxes will come every year, but the truffles may not. So, as we looked at the few rows of green oak and pubescent oak seedlings, I nodded in agreement \u2014 truffles are a most uncertain asset; they are more a way of life.Before waving goodbye, I offered to email Jean Louis photographs, should any of them turn out well. \u201cI don\u2019t do internet, but my neighbor does,\u201d he said. A truly rural existence can be lived out here. He had augmented his hereditary knowledge of the terroir with the latest scientific findings on truffles, so, make no mistake, he is no rube. He is highly adapted to the specific ecosystem he inhabits, like, say, a trader is to Wall Street. He just doesn\u2019t need a worldwide web to flourish.These several cold weeks in January, observing the microcosm of the black truffles of Perigord have yielded small and large insights. The small have to do with relationships \u2014 between knowledge and science, passion and profit, fungus and trees, buyers and sellers. The larger gift, for me, though, is a metaphor. Heady and fussy tubers, so difficult to cultivate in a controlled environment, just under the surface if you know where to look, have tweaked some ancient attraction, like a first date with someone destined to become a companion. I expect I\u2019ll be in love with southwest France the rest of my life.\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014Emily Conyngham now lives in France, after a nine-month fling with the country turned into true love.

In a traditional interactive zero-knowledge protocol, several rounds of exchanges between the prover and the verifier are needed before a verifier can be convinced. A zk-SNARK is essentially a non-interactive zero-knowledge protocol that allows this exchange between a prover and a verifier to be very short. To implement a zk-SNARK in Ethereum, you can use the ZoKrates toolbox. With ZoKrates, you can create a smart contract to act as the verifier. You can also use it to generate your proof that you know some secret information and convince the verifier of this. Instead of convincing a verifier over some kind of online channel, you simply publish the fact that you convinced the verifying smart contract to the Ethereum network.Getting StartedThis article will act as a tutorial for setting up ZoKrates and integrating your zk-SNARK with your Truffle environment. You will need to have truffle and docker installed before proceeding.It is also recommended that you read this article to get a primer on zk-SNARKs and their role in Ethereum. In that article, the functions of the Generator, Prover and the Verifier are outlined \u2014 these are going to be the points of reference for the following sections.To start off, create a new working directory and run truffle init to create a new Truffle environment.GeneratorAs the Generator, you\u2019re going to run the trusted setup for the zk-SNARK to generate the verifying key and the proving key. The key generation function takes in a secret value as an extra parameter, and you are trusted with the important task of deleting this secret value after it\u2019s used so that people can\u2019t generate false proofs down the line. Luckily, ZoKrates will handle this for you.Running the generator functionYou will run the generator off-chain to produce the verifying key vk and the proving key pk. The vk will be hardcoded into the generated smart contract, and the pk will be a file you will need to share with provers. To get started, you will need to start up ZoKrates:docker run -ti kyroy/zokrates /bin/bashIn the container you need to cd ZoKrates/ before proceeding.The function used to generate vk and pk requires a program that's modelled as an arithmetic circuit, and a secret value. For the setup to be a 'trusted setup' you need to delete the secret value, but as discussed earlier ZoKrates handles this for you. So the only thing you need to worry about is the program, which you need to provide in the form of a .code file. You can either use one of the example files in the ZoKrates examples/ directory, or create your own. To model the program as an arithmetic circuit, you need ZoKrates to compile it:./target/release/zokrates compile -i FILE_NAME.codeThis creates two files, out which is used in the next step, and out.code which you can read if you want. Now you need to run the setup phase:./target/release/zokrates setupNo arguments are required as it picks up the out file automatically. This creates verification.key and proving.key, the proving.key file is what you will need to share to provers as the pk. It also creates a file called variables.inf which provides details of the constraints for the original program. Finally, to create the actual smart contract:./target/release/zokrates export-verifierAgain, no arguments are required as it picks up the verification.key file automatically. This creates verifier.sol, which has the vk hardcoded into the Verifier contract. It has a function verifyTx which is used by a Prover (by passing their generated proof) to verify that their proof satisfies the original program.Exporting the required filesThe whole fun of having a verifying smart contract for a zero-knowledge proof is for a prover to be able to show off that they know some secret information, so for the contract to be of any use, it will need to be deployed to either the main net or a test net. To start, we need to get the required files out of the Docker container and into the Truffle environment. The required files are the verifier.sol file to deploy the contract to the chosen network, the proving.key file so provers can generate proofs, the out file so provers can compute a witness, and the variables.inf file which is also needed to generate a proof. In a separate terminal window or tab, run docker ps to get the container id that ZoKrates is in. To get the files in the right directories:docker cp CONTAINER_ID:root/ZoKrates/verifier.sol ./contractsdocker cp CONTAINER_ID:root/ZoKrates/proving.key ./docker cp CONTAINER_ID:root/ZoKrates/out ./docker cp CONTAINER_ID:root/ZoKrates/variables.inf ./This is assuming you started up ZoKrates in your Truffle working directory in the first place. You can now close the Docker environment by running exit.Deploying the smart contractSet up your migrations/2_deploy_contracts.js and truffle-config.js files for deployment to whichever network you want to put the Verifieron. For this tutorial we\u2019ll use Rinkeby, and an easy way to deploy it is by using Infura through Truffle. With the configuration finished, run:truffle migrate --network rinkebyAnd that\u2019s you done! Now for a prover to use the Verifier contract, you need to share the verifier.json artifact so they can interact with it through truffle-contract or truffle console (or just share the ABI and address for non-Truffle interaction), the proving.key and variables.inf files so they can generate their proof and the out file so they can compute their witness.ProverAs the prover, you have found a contract Verifier which provides a verifyTx function, taking in a proof as a parameter which you know you can generate \u2014 because you know some secret information to satisfy the original program generated in the setup! You want to generate this proof that you know the secret information, so you obtain the verifier.json Truffle artifact (or ABI and contract address), the pk in the file proving.key, the variables.inf file and the out file which represents the original program as an arithmetic circuit.Importing required files to ZoKratesAs before, to start ZoKrates run:docker run -ti kyroy/zokrates /bin/bashIn the container you need to run cd Zokrates/ before proceeding.Before you can generate your proof you need to compute a witness, in which you enter the public arguments as well as your secret information in order to satisfy the proof. First, you\u2019ll need to import the required files to the Docker container. In a separate terminal window or tab, run docker ps to get the container id that ZoKrates is in, then run:docker cp ./out CONTAINER_ID:root/ZoKrates/docker cp ./proving.key CONTAINER_ID:root/ZoKrates/ docker cp ./variables.inf CONTAINER_ID:root/ZoKrates/Now to compute the witness, in the Docker container run:./target/release/zokrates compute-witness -a [arg0 arg1 .. argN]Where you input your arguments as needed as a space separated list. Note that the newer version of ZoKrates takes the secret information (private parameters) as arguments here, whereas in the older version you would enter an interactive environment to input private values. This creates a file witness which will be used in the next step.Generate your proofNow with your computed witness and the pk available, you can generate your proof. To do this, run:./target/release/zokrates generate-proofNo arguments are required as it picks up the witness and proving.key files automatically, as well as the variables.inffile. ZoKrates doesn't actually generate a proof file here \u2014 instead it will spit out some output that looks like this:A = 0x5743c0dd166bacb272bf191c57c62a7f9e6fa5350a75ec10d04e951988044e0, 0x1a7c371ef983a24a64f6e0a0895699dd3ee47291a02582ad01575d6f40937389A_p = 0x1727fe01690803f370b0529bb867d538f21a0243e01498bd7d75e5581adf1543, 0x103e9cc0800f170b7fd56563397e4423e92ada4885fc5775edbad2ee0182c5a6B = [0x1042ffb222d04811503565dd0383e394dbf14123cc59e7a96a4e38724c54e410, 0xf90d20c5a22207f2194aa31a27050ed3163e140e10b683b60c05d8f4b90838f], [0x28711042902b5a93688396fd3d335a99ee2f3ac23b678b2b16972a7794fa58f5, 0x26c0a26e2690ffea68b3add058e817b126d25fc8f76184701a392241cd95e94c]B_p = 0x3a6788801c11e76a999762e6ce9553829921269e59bbc0daec5f05e360e6c8f, 0x7046c0a74b42d7711918521ef9894e2e7816f53aad3730cb0e6eb26e76a3830C = 0x1a3f691edfac16abfd8eaa44cdf72208e5fdcfea1c851314e37fff46d89def46, 0x5ca8c10703d97653a90c231244037f6da778a60e7b90c866fc9e8234cba4719C_p = 0x21f34e4b0c6d82c8fe018a81dab2fa7791addc41307a909bcede640043f9211d, 0x24d412695575320871eac309e74198de60c229fe3693706395c859f64de24157H = 0x241dbdaa080c3fcbaa2421eec29e8118486b1eee7e769b295564fe1af86bb141, 0x13ba9419b8445c675c727bf6201faa79be892bc078e24f46aae20ac0f49fb4b3K = 0x1f758dd7c493067b7d288fb37028d6d3f8fe0117a66cf51c40f327defcf4a0cf, 0x11f9990afa4b102507da488d481d5e0cf7fb95c89e5c5c038ee8da2978b4a063Verify your proofThese are the eight variables that make up a zk-SNARKs proof. You can now pass these eight variables into the verifyTx function in the verifier contract (using the truffle-contract abstraction of the contract using the verifier.json artifact, or whichever mechanism you see fit). If you do have the verifier.json artifact, you can easily verify your proof through truffle console. To start up the Truffle console run:truffle console --network rinkebyIf the verifier.json file is correct, you should be able to run Verifier.deployed() in the console and it will spit out the artifiact details. Unfortunately, the 8 proof values need to be defined as string arrays, so you need to wrap each value in quotation marks and then wrap those in an array. For example:truffle(rinkeby)> let A = [\"0x5743c0dd166bacb272bf191c57c62a7f9e6fa5350a75ec10d04e951988044e0\", \"0x1a7c371ef983a24a64f6e0a0895699dd3ee47291a02582ad01575d6f40937389\"]And do this A through K. The verifyTx function actually takes 9 parameters, and this 9th parameter I is an array with 2 elements in it of the form [...publicInputs, ...outputs]. Say the public input was 5 and you want verifyTx to output 1, you would define I astruffle(rinkeby)> let I = [5,1]Finally, to validate your proof to the network, you run:truffle(rinkeby)> Verifier.deployed().then(instance => { return instance.verifyTx(A, A_p, B, B_p, C, C_p, H, K, I) })Note, if you have trouble at this step and a TypeError is raised, see this issue. If the Verified event is emitted, then you have completed the zero knowledge proof! The role of the Verifier would simply be to observe this transaction, and note that the Verified event was emitted, so the prover must know the secret information to satisfy the original program.Linked articles and further readingZoKrates projectIntroduction to zk-SNARKs with examplesHow zk-SNARKs are constructed in Zcashzk-SNARKs: Driver\u2019s edZcash and the Trusted Setupzk-SNARKs in a NutshellUsing Infura with TruffleZoKrates Verifier Truffle IssueIf you would like to arrange a consultation, or would like to hire us to develop a bespoke blockchain solution, visit our website and get in touch.", "responses": 2, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Blockchain", "Zksnark", "Zero Knowledge", "Zero Knowledge Proofs"]}, {"title": "5 Tips To Beat The New Facebook Algorithm", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@trufflewoo/5-tips-to-beat-the-new-facebook-algorithm-c8ecdbc2fcb6?source=search_post", "author_name": "Truffle Woo", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@trufflewoo", "publish_date": "2018-01-25", "last_modified_date": "2018-03-18", "readtime": "4.82", "claps": 48, "voters": 9, "content": "5 Tips To Beat The New Facebook AlgorithmTruffle WooFollowJan 25, 2018 \u00b7 5 min readThis year 2018 started with major changes for Facebook marketers, community and content managers. These changes were announced by the Facebook CEO, Mark Zuckerberg through his Facebook post on January 12th.\u201cWe built Facebook to help people stay connected and bring us closer together with the people that matter to us. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve always put friends and family at the core of the experience. Research shows that strengthening our relationships improves our well-being and happiness.But recently we\u2019ve gotten feedback from our community that public content \u2014 posts from businesses, brands and media \u2014 is crowding out the personal moments that lead us to connect more with each other.It\u2019s easy to understand how we got here.\u201dTo sum up what he said and rephrase it in my own words, he clearly means the newsfeed will contain less content from pages, and more & more content from friends and family.The algorithm change that Mark Zuckerberg announced has left many marketers unsure of how to proceed with their Facebook strategy, but here are some of my suggestions to keep your business relevant on Facebook and still get the same reach and results.Facebook Groups are the new pagesIf you\u2019re a community manager or you\u2019re doing Facebook marketing for a while, you must have stumbled on the Community category on the side menu of your page, just like the following.This feature allows you to create a Facebook group related to your page, in which you can add your followers, customers, audience and any Facebook users who are interested in your content or product.This can keep your content close to your followers because the Facebook reach rule and algorithm doesn\u2019t apply on groups. What you publish will be seen by all group members, I got you excited right?But I advise you to publish the post on your Facebook page first, and then you share it to your Group. That way you ensure you\u2019re still getting high reach on your page, while still making sure your content is accessible to your followers.This is just one of my predictions, I\u2019m 100% sure this will be the case few months from today, I can feel it.CEOs & marketers as influencersAnother alternative and this is another prediction, in 2018 we\u2019ll see more marketing managers and CEOs as marketing influences on Facebook, using their personal Facebook profile.It is not just a random prediction but here is the logic behind it.Mark Zuckerberg said that we\u2019ll be seeing more content from our friends on newsfeed, right? So if you\u2019re keeping your Facebook profile public and becoming an influencer, you can have up to 5000 friend who are your customers and people who are interested in your content or product.Not only, you can allow unlimitedly people to follow your profile if you reach the 5000 friends limit.Guess what! On the newsfeed and Facebook algorithm, you\u2019re still considered a \u2018Friend\u2019 ;) The rules do not apply to Friends as Mark said.See first notificationActually this is not that recent feature for pages on Facebook, and it looks ready to become more relevant during this year.When your followers select this option for your page, your posts will appear at the top of their newsfeed and also they can subscribe for the option of receiving a notification when you publish a new post.But this has 2 sides. The first side is if you\u2019re followers are really engaged with you and you\u2019re providing them with high quality content that matches with their interests, you shouldn\u2019t worry that much because they would do it for you when you ask them.The second side obviously is, \u201cHow do I get my followers to select the See First option?\u201dHave no fear, Truffle is here. I got you a solution.You can promote a random giveaway for followers who:\u00b7 Subscribe to See First option\u00b7 Screenshot it\u00b7 Send it via DM to the page, post it in comment\u2026 Whatever works for youAnd you offer the winner a coupon, free sample product, gift\u2026 You can buy the winner a car if you want.This will keep your content alive on the newsfeed.Make it rain for reach \u2014 Boost postsIncreasing your reach is an advertising objective which will optimize your ad to be shown to as many unique individuals as possible. Boosting a Post is what is done when you want to spend money to increase the circulation of a particular post. By Boosting your Post, you essentially pay money and turn your post into an advertisement which can then have targeting selected for it so that it goes out to the people who you want to see it.Video content\u201cIf we have data let\u2019s look at data. If all we have are opinions let\u2019s go with mine.\u201d -Jim BarksdaleNever mind my opinion now, I got data for you:According to Buffer video consumption on mobile has increased 233% since 2013, and more than half of video views take place on mobile.With more and more people viewing videos on mobile, it\u2019ll be great to experiment with square videos to see if they improve your video performance. Including subtitles can get you higher reach and viewers. I take it for myself, most of time I\u2019m around people or at the office and I watch muted videos without actually clicking to open with sound.Lastly, live videos get even higher organic reach than other Facebook videos. Hosting live streaming keep your page on newsfeed also, you can include it in your Facebook strategy.ConclusionTo sum up, it is not the first time Facebook algorithm decrease the organic reach of business pages. Between January and July of 2016 alone, Facebook pages have experienced a dramatic 52% decline in organic reach. The same way we survived that, we can also survive this. But only when we do it right.Enjoyed that read? Click the \u2764 below to recommend it to other interested readers!I\u2019d love to hear your feedback, questions and thoughts as well.

You can view the code and presentation from that talk on Github. While preparing for that talk, I looked at a lot of smart contract tutorials that showed smart contract tests using MyContract.deployed() in their mocha tests. While this benefits your tests by making use of the Truffle Clean Room Environment and speeds up your tests by only deploying a new set of contracts once per test file, I do not believe this leads to clean, easy to understand unit tests for your smart contracts. As I describe in that talk, I believe it is better to use beforeEach blocks in your tests to deploy new contracts for each test, creating a clean state in which each individual test can run. For instance:const MyContractAbstraction = artifacts.require('MyContract');contract('My Contract', function(accounts) {  const from = accounts[0];  let myContract;beforeEach(async () => {    myContract = await MyContractAbstraction.new({from});  });describe('.transfer', () => {    it('test that transfer works', async () => {      // some tests that start with a fresh MyContract contract instance    });    it('test that transfer works again', async () => {      // the balance of this test would be unaffected by the first test    });  });});After presenting my talk and thinking about the different uses of Truffle migrations during testing (i.e. they can be very helpful for writing integration tests where you want state to persist between test statements), I realized there was an important type of test that these migrations do help with and that I hadn\u2019t read about or used before.Testing Migrations with TruffleTruffle migrations serve two purposes:They setup the clean room environment for your truffle testing.More importantly, if you want to use Truffle to manage your singleton contracts on test- and mainnets, they are how you deploy and potentially upgrade contracts.It is this second use case that led me to think about testing truffle migrations. In most simple Dapp tutorials you only need to launch one contract. However, even if it is an ERC-20 token contract, it could be important how it is configured. If you didn\u2019t hard code your decimalUnits, totalSupply, and symbol into your contract, you will have to set those via your constructor when making the new contract call. Lets say you have this contract:pragma solidity 0.4.24;import \"openzeppelin-solidity/contracts/token/ERC20/StandardToken.sol\";contract SimpleToken is StandardToken {  constructor(        uint256 _initialAmount,        string _name,        uint8 _decimalUnits,        string _symbol    )        public    {      name = _name;      decimals = _decimalUnits;      symbol = _symbol;      totalSupply_ = _initialAmount;      balances[msg.sender] = _initialAmount;      emit Transfer(address(0), msg.sender, totalSupply_);    }}This will launch a very basic ERC-20 token that can be setup dynamically. So you might write a migration like this: /migrations/2_deploy_token.jsconst SimpleToken = artifacts.require('SimpleToken');module.exports = function(deployer, network, accounts) {  deployer.deploy(    SimpleToken,    1000000000000000000000000000, // 1 billion tokens initial supply    'Simple Token',    18,    'STK',  );};Great, you now have a very simple ERC-20 and a migration to launch it. You can launch ganache locally, run truffle migrate and start interacting with your new token on your local testnet.However, once your ready to go to Rinkeby, or even Mainnet, you\u2019re trusting that that migration was setup correctly. If you forgot to convert your token\u2019s initial supply based on decimal units, you might launch a token with 100 as the initial supply and have an impossibly small supply of tokens. What if you change your token contract to improve it and have to introduce a new constructor parameter? This will break your migration and you might not discover it until you try to launch. These all sound like good reasons to write a test. You want to know your code works now as expected and will continue to work in the future as expected.Thankfully, Truffle gives us a really great way to test our migrations. (Remember, MyContract.deployed() from above that I said I didn\u2019t like to use in my tests\u2026) To test my Token migration here I could have a test file like:const SimpleTokenAbstraction = artifacts.require('SimpleToken');contract('deploy_SimpleToken', function(accounts) {  let deployed;  const expectedArgs = {    owner: accounts[0],    initialAmount: 1000000000000000000000000000,    name: 'Simple Token',    decimalUnits: 18,    symbol: 'STK',  };before( async () => {    deployed = await SimpleTokenAbstraction.deployed();  });Then I could write a test that made sure the contract got deployed:describe('Deployed', () => {    it('it should deploy the SimpleToken contract to the network', async () => {      assert.isNotNull(deployed, 'The contract was not deployed');    });  });And ones to make sure it was deployed with the correct parameters, like:describe('constructor', () => {    it('it was deployed and assigned the correct balance', async () => {      const errMsg = 'Owner did not receive the initialAmount';      const ownerBalance = await deployed.balanceOf.call(expectedArgs.owner);      assert.equal(ownerBalance.toNumber(), expectedArgs.initialAmount, errMsg);    });  })});This allows me to ensure my migrations, a critical part of my application, will function as expected.In this simple example it may not seem that important, but as you get into more complicated smart contracts and interactions between smart contracts, knowing that your migrations are going to deploy your system correctly, can be incredibly important.One such example I have run into while working on Meridio is with upgradeable smart contracts. When the smart contract that holds the functionality gets launched it needs to be initialized. We can\u2019t use constructors with implementation contracts because the proxies we launch later won\u2019t get the constructor state run. However, in order to ensure the continued and expected functionality of that implementation, it needs to be initialized. This is a great example where a simple oversight could lead to disastrous consequences\u2026 say if you didn\u2019t initialize and therefore the owner of your implementation is never set\u2026 (for more details about how important this is see CoinTelegraph\u2019s the Parity Multisig Hack post mortem from Nov 2017).I\u2019m hoping to write more about upgradeable contracts, implementations and initialization in the near future, but in the meantime if you want to learn more about those topics, check out this great blog article from Zeppelin and Elena Nadolinski.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Smart Contracts", "Testing", "Development", "Truffle"]}, {"title": "How to fix your Truffle and Solidity version errors with NPX (from npm)", "post_link": "https://medium.com/blockchangers/how-to-fix-your-truffle-and-solidity-versioning-with-npx-from-npm-51b5fcb0825f?source=search_post", "author_name": "Jonas Therkelsen", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@jonas.foyn", "publish_date": "2019-05-09", "last_modified_date": "2019-05-09", "readtime": "1.60", "claps": 166, "voters": 9, "content": "How to fix your Truffle and Solidity version errors with NPX (from npm)Jonas TherkelsenFollowMay 9 \u00b7 2 min readStruggling with different versions of your global and local node packages? npm has a brilliant way to solve all your worries!\u201cError: \u2018module\u2019 is undefined\u201d is a normal bug to encounter when cloning repositories with old truffle versions, where the Truffle configuration file used to be a javascript file called truffle.js.When developing, testing and migrating smart contract with the Truffle Framework, it is common to stumble upon versioning problems with Truffle.Given that your coding predecessor has done his job correctly setting up the node package configuration file (package.json) you will find it easy to overcome versioning problems with Truffle and Solidity.If you followed the steps on Truffle\u2019s documentation site, you probably executed a global installation of your truffle package.A better way to do it, is simply not to do it!How then, you ask? Use npx! (which you probably already have)An example flow could be as follows:Step 1. You clone a repository using Gitgit clone https://some-old-truffle-repository.comStep 2. You change to this directorycd some-old-truffle-repositoryStep 3. You install the node packagesnpm installStep 4. You try to compile, test and migrate contracts with your global installation of Truffletruffle compiletruffle testtruffle migrateBut\u2026 errors!\u201cSource file requires different compiler version (current compiler is 0.5.0+commit.1d4f565a.Emscripten.clang \u2014 note that nightly builds are considered to be strictly less than the released version)\u201d is a common problem to encounter.FIX: A more reliable way to using Truffle!Swap your Step 4: Compile, test, and migrate using your local Truffle version!npx truffle compilenpx truffle testnpx truffle migrateWhat\u2019s going on here?npx is a native npm package, so it comes with your installation of nodejs & npm.It allows you to run local node package binaries. This way, you can get rid of a lot of your global package installations, and use the local binaries that are defined in your package.json.Kat March\u00e1n has already written an awesome guide to using npx, check it out!For your own and others\u2019 sake, remember to always have correct versioning in your package.json in the future!Cheers!Anything else on Ethereum development you want to hear about?

or private Ethereum networks using a NodETH Ethereum nodeJoseph RosFollowAug 23, 2017 \u00b7 3 min readNodETH takes the hassle out of deploying Ethereum nodes. Truffle makes it easy to develop Ethereum smart contracts. We\u2019re going to show you how you can combine the two to create a powerful contract creation and deployment solution.So. You\u2019ve spent hours working on a smart contract using truffle? Debugged it locally? Written comprehensive tests? (please please please do this! especially if it\u2019s for an ICO!) Now it\u2019s time to move beyond testprc and let the world see your work by deploying to a public blockchain.1. Create a nodeTruffle needs to connect to an Ethereum node to deploy your contract to the blockchain. So the first step is to create your node and open it up in the NodETH interface. You can deploy with any node size (light, fast or full) and to any network \u2014 main, test or even private networks created on NodETH.2. Expose the APIs truffle needs to deploy contractsTo deploy a contract Truffle needs your node to expose certain JSON RPC API endpoints. Make sure your node is accessible via RPC API and is allowing access to the eth, net, web3 and personal APIs:Hit save and grab the RPC URL for your node. We\u2019re going to need this to connect to your node.3. Create a deployment address and give it some ETHBehind the scenes, when truffle deploys a contract it is sending transactions with your new contracts code to a an empty address on the network\u2014 the contract creation address. All transactions have to come from and be signed by an account. So your node will need at least one account associated with it to deploy from.Solidity trivia: in your contract\u2019s constructor msg.sender will be the address of the account from which your contract is deployed. You can use this to set an \u2018admin\u2019 account for a contract with additional permissions for subsequent sensitive method calls.You can import an existing keyfile for an account if you have one or create a new one by attaching to your node via geth installed on your local machine:> geth attach rpc:<node rpc url>Welcome to the Geth JavaScript console!instance: Geth/v1.6.6-stable-10a45cb5/linux-amd64/go1.8.1modules: admin:1.0 debug:1.0 eth:1.0 miner:1.0 net:1.0 personal:1.0 rpc:1.0 txpool:1.0 web3:1.0> personal.newAccount()Passphrase:Repeat passphrase:\u201c0x7b1d07eb6dc0ad1ad6f3e6b2e922b3f454b53e24\u201dYou\u2019ll have to beg, buy, borrow, steal or mine some ETH for this account to pay the gas cost of deploying your contract.Now attach to your node\u2019s geth console and make sure the account is an unlocked state so truffle can send deployment transactions from it:> personal.unlockAccount(eth.accounts[0])Unlock account 0x3b0a89c8dc5dead7ef230e6cb057eddb740bd1ebPassphrase:true4. Configure truffle.js to use your nodeAlmost there \u2014 next up is the fun part! But first we need to tell truffle about your NodETH node.Fire up a new terminal and cd into your contract directory. Generate a package.json file if you haven\u2019t got one:npm init -fNext We\u2019re going to install web3 as a dependency:npm install --save web3@0.20Now, open up truffle.js and add your NodETH network configuration:var Web3 = require('web3');var provider = new Web3.providers.HttpProvider(\"<node rpc url>\");module.exports = {  networks: {    development: {      host: \"localhost\",      port: 8545,      network_id: \"*\" // Match any network id    },    nodeth: {      provider: provider,      network_id: \"*\", // any network associated with your node      from: \"<deployment account address>\"    }  }};Additional network configuration options can be found in Truffle\u2019s documentation.5. Deploy!Now you\u2019re ready to go. Head back to the console and run:truffle deploy --network nodethWatch in amazement as your contract is deployed into the network via your NodETH node \u2014 ready for the world to interact with.", "responses": 2, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Blockchain", "Bitcoin", "Cryptocurrency"]}, {"title": "Migrating an Ethereum Smart Contract to a Live Network with Truffle", "post_link": "https://medium.com/coinmonks/migrating-an-ethereum-smart-contract-to-a-live-network-with-truffle-d5d35fcec327?source=search_post", "author_name": "Jason Smythe", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@jasoons", "publish_date": "2018-05-11", "last_modified_date": "2019-01-05", "readtime": "5.09", "claps": 147, "voters": 8, "content": "Migrating an Ethereum Smart Contract to a Live Network with TruffleJason SmytheFollowMay 11, 2018 \u00b7 6 min readThe next step once you have built your first Ethereum smart contract is to deploy it to a live network, because lonely smart contracts running onlocalhost are sad and lonely.This tutorial will use the simple react truffle box as a starting point, for the sake of simplicity. First we will test and run this app on a local test ethereum environment, then we will deploy the smart contracts to the Rinkeby test net and run it from there.**disclaimer ** This tutorial is aimed at people who are familiar with the basics of ethereum and smart contracts already. If you are new to ethereum it is possible to follow along with this tutorial, but recommend starting with a simple \u2018built your first dapp\u2019 kind of tutorial first.Setup(If you have an existing truffle project running locally feel free to skip this section, and go to the Deploy to Rinkeby section below.)The first requirement is to set up your javascript environment (if you already have npm installed you\u2019re golden). My preferred method of installing node/npm is with nvm (node version manager) for Linux/Mac, or just use the standard installer. You will also need a web3/ethereum enabled browser, I recommend using MetaMask for this purpose.Next you will need to install truffle and ganache; do this with npm install -g truffle ganache-cli.Then open the terminal in a folder you are want to work from and run truffle unbox react . This will download the pre-made boilerplate which is a minimal set-up of truffle and react, be prepared to wait quite a few minutes for it to download and configure everything.Thereafter run npm start to fire up the UI and view it in your browser at http://localhost:3000 and see the interface as below.The running truffle box.On the surface everything looks good but if you open the browser console you will see the following error:This is error is because the contract hasn\u2019t been deployed to the ethereum network that MetaMask is injecting into the browser (yay, to reading error messages!). If you don\u2019t get the line saying \u2018Injected web3 detected.\u2019 please make sure that your MetaMask is set up correctly.So what we need to do is to deploy the smart contract to the network. We do this by opening another terminal and running ganache-cli -m \u201cyour twelve work pass phrase from metamask \u2026\u201d . When we open MetaMask and set the network to \u2018Localhost 8545\u2019 we will see 100.0 Eth has appeared in our account.Selecting the Ganache testnet in MetaMaskNow we need to tell Truffle about this network so that it can deploy to it. Edit the \u2018truffle.js\u2019 (or \u2018truffle-config.js\u2019 on Windows) file contain the following:module.exports = {  networks: {    development: {      host: 'localhost',      port: 8545,      network_id: '*' // Match any network id    }  }};Now run truffle compile followed by truffle migrate --network development . Reload the UI and a MetaMask dialogue asking you to confirm a transaction will display; provided MetaMask is unlocked. Once you accept the transaction the code will set a variable in the smart contract to \u20185\u2019 and display that in the browser.So far so good! Onwards to Rinkeby my dear friends.Deploy to RinkebySet MetaMask to use the \u2018Rinkeby Test Network\u2019. If your balance is zero go to this faucet to get hands on some test ether for your primary ethereum address (your first address in MetaMask). Deploying contracts to ethereum is an expensive process (it can be as much as 50 USD for complex contracts), so I highly recommend practising with test ether.We will be using Infura as a hosted node for the sake of convenience; so go ahead and create an Infura account here and record the key that you receive. I will cover how to use a locally running ethereum node in the next section.Next, runnpm i -s truffle-hdwallet-providerto install a provider that will connect you to the chosen network, sign your transactions and submit these transactions to the network.A \u2018provider\u2019 is used by web3 to submit transactions to the ethereum network and in this case sign these transactions. To use the provider add the following to your truffle.js file. We are using a network_id of 3 for rinkeby, but other network IDs that may be of interest are 1, 4, 42 for main-net, ropsten and kovan respectively.const HDWalletProvider = require(\"truffle-hdwallet-provider\");const memonic = \"your twelve work pass phrase from metamask \u2026\"module.exports = {  networks: {    development: {      host: 'localhost',      port: 8545,      network_id: '*' // Match any network id    },    rinkeby: {      provider: function() {        return new HDWalletProvider(memonic, \"https://rinkeby.infura.io/<<your_infura_access_token>>\")      },      network_id: 3    }  }};Now you are ready to run the migrations again truffle migrate --network rinkeby . This will take a bit longer than last when we used Ganache before since we need to wait for the blocks to be mined by the network.You can then copy the hash from the transaction, in this case 0xbdf619456e2a48065c176304b806b9d334bfd8b5cd389d477ac8d5007f9ba9e5 , and search for it on rinkeby etherscan to confirm and view the details of your transaction.Open the user interface again and confirm the transaction to set the storage and confirm that the transaction went through on etherscan.Congratulations, you have deployed your first contract to a public network!ChallengeIf you want to try something slightly more difficult you can try deploying your contract with this modified provider engine that uses a private key directly rather than a memonic phrase. This is directly modified from the original truffle-hdwallet-provider.Using a locally running nodeYou can also deploy directly to a local node with an unlocked account. Please be extremely careful with this method, as if your ethereum node is opened up to the public they can execute a transaction with your unlocked account (read steal all your ethereum). This can be done with parity or geth running locally. Please refer to their respective documentation to set them up.Once your node is running correctly you can deploy your contract in exactly the same way as you did with Ganache, since it also just provides you with a set of unlocked accounts.Another fun way to deploy your contracts to public networksYou can use https://remix.ethereum.org, paste your code there or use remixd, chose your environment (injected web3 is refering to metamask, as seen in the image below), and click deploy. If you use this method you will need to manually save and link the contract address to Truffle if you want to use Truffle for your UI.I hope you had fun deploying your first dapp to the world!Please

What if I told you that you could easily set up a blockchain development environment and work on your decentralized application (dapp) completely locally?Yes you can, with Truffle!What We Are Going To DoFor this tutorial, we will be deploying a simple smart contract with Truffle, and try to interact with it with a very simple web application.Function ListGetting the message\u2014 we will be retrieving data (string data) from our Smart Contract and display it in our web pageSetting the message \u2014 we will be able to change the message textToolsSmart ContractSolidity, Metamask, Truffle, GanacheFrontendWeb3.js, live-serverAbout TruffleTruffle is basically a development environment where you could easily develop smart contracts with it\u2019s built-in testing framework, smart contract compilation, deployment, interactive console, and many more features.It is mostly recommended for developers who want to build Javascript projects based on smart contracts (like dapps). With Truffle, you are able to have a better simulation of a real blockchain environment.Making the ProjectWorkflowGetting Started with TruffleInteracting with the Smart ContractGetting Started with TruffleFirst, we install the packages we will be using by first opening Terminal/CMD and then execute this command:npm install -g truffle ganache-cli live-serverAfter that, let\u2019s create our project folder, which we will call HelloWorld. You can do this using the same Terminal/CMD, and executing these commands:mkdir HelloWorldcd HelloWorldWith Truffle, you can create a bare project template, or use Truffle Boxes, which are example applications and project templates. For this tutorial, we will be starting from scratch, so we execute this command:truffle initThis command creates a bare Truffle project without anything else included.After doing so, you should have the following files and folders:contracts/: Directory for Solidity contractsmigrations/: Directory for scriptable deploymenttest/: Directory for test files for testing your application and contractstruffle-config.js: Truffle configuration fileContract CompilationNow let\u2019s proceed to smart contract compilation with Truffle. Before anything else, let\u2019s create a very simple smart contract named HelloWorld.sol and place it inside the contracts folder. All smart contracts you create should be placed inside this folder.The smart contract will contain code that\u2019s as simple as this:Basically, our smart contract has a variable named message, which contains string data that is initialized as hello world. Then we have functions that can get or set that variable\u2019s value.Let\u2019s try compiling our smart contract! Execute the command:truffle compileNow, compilation could fail and show an error similar to this:SyntaxError: Source file requires different compiler versionBy default, Truffle uses Solidity version 0.5.0, but our contract uses 0.5.3. And so, we need to tell Truffle to use Solidity version 0.5.3 to compile our contracts by editing the Truffle configuration (truffle-config.js). Currently, the configuration should look like this:module.exports = {  networks: {  },  mocha: {  },  compilers: {    solc: {    }  }}To briefly describe the parts that make up the configuration:networks: will hold the configuration of our Ethereum client where we will be deploying our contracts. We will discuss more on this on the later part of the tutorial.mocha: configuration for automated tests using the Javascript testing framework called \u201cMocha\u201d.compilers: specification of compilers to be used, like solc (Solidity compiler), and what version should be used.You might have already guessed which part we will be editing for now, which is the compilers part of the configuration.Since we want Truffle to use Solidity version 0.5.3, we must use the following compilers configuration:compilers: {  solc: {    version: \u201c0.5.3\u201d,    docker: false  }}Let\u2019s run truffle compile once again. The contracts should successfully compile this time. Basically, the compile command compiles Solidity code to bytecode (the code that the Ethereum Virtual Machine or EVM understands).Now all that\u2019s left is the deployment!Contract DeploymentNow that we\u2019ve created and compiled our sample smart contract, let\u2019s see how we can deploy it to the blockchain. In order to do this, we\u2019ll need to create a new file in the migrations directory. So, create a new file named 2_deploy_contracts.js, and place the following code:Truffle migrations are basically scripts that help us deploy our contracts to the blockchain. The first line is there to import the HelloWorld.sol file from the contracts folder, and line 4 deploys it to the blockchain.Let\u2019s try deploying by executing the command:truffle migrateYou\u2019ll notice that it will raise an error saying something likeCould not connect to your Ethereum client. Please check that your Ethereum client: \u2014 is running \u2014 is accepting RPC connections (i.e., \u201c \u2014 rpc\u201d option is used in geth) \u2014 is accessible over the network \u2014 is properly configured in your Truffle configuration file (truffle-config.js)Yes, you guessed it right, it\u2019s because we haven\u2019t specified our Ethereum client yet in the networks part of our configuration. We can use a locally setup blockchain here, via the truffle develop command or Ganache. We could even deploy straight to Ethereum\u2019s Ropsten Test Network if we configure it here. For this tutorial though, we\u2019ll be using Ganache.Let\u2019s open truffle-config.js, and change the networks part to look like this:networks: {  development: {    host: \u201c127.0.0.1\u201d,    port: 8545,    network_id: \u201c*\u201d  }}This means that we will be using a local Ethereum client (hosted at 127.0.0.1, which means local) on port 8545.Your truffle-config.js file should now look like this:Then, open a new Terminal/CMD and start Ganache on port 8545 by executing the following command:ganache-cli -p 8545Now, back to our first Terminal/CMD, we executetruffle migrate -network developmentto deploy the code to the blockchain. In our case, the blockchain could be found in the network development which we set earlier in the truffle-config.js file.truffle deploy (Left), ganache-cli (Right)If everything went well as expected, you should be able to see a summary of the deployment on the Terminal/CMD where we did truffle deploy (as shown on the left image), and the transaction data on the Terminal/CMD with Ganache running (as shown on the right image).At this point, we\u2019re basically done deploying our contract!Interacting with the Smart ContractLet\u2019s try interacting with our deployed contract through a very simple web application! Here, we\u2019ll just be calling the getMessage() function, and display the text.Create a folder named src (same level as contracts folder and truffle-config.js) and create a file named abi.js inside it. Then, from the build folder, and then contracts folder, open HelloWorld.json (build/contracts/HelloWorld.json), and copy the value of the abi key.Now in abi.js, make a variable named abi and paste the data we previously copied. Now, abi.js should look like this:The Application Binary Interface (ABI) is basically a specification in the form of a JSON, that describes the contract. We will need this for the web3 connection later.Simple Web PageOn the same folder (src), create a file named index.html, and add the following code:Simply put, we are creating a web page with one <div> having the ID, message. And as you see, we have 3 <script> tags in place.The first one just imports the web3 from a CDN, as can be seen in their short documentation right here. The second one imports the abi.js file that we created earlier. Finally, the third one will be where we will be putting some Javascript code to interact with our deployed contract. Now, in this part (3rd script tag), we will now be adding some code which will make it look like this:Let\u2019s briefly go through the code. On the first line, window.addEventListener(\u2018load\u2019, async () => {} just means that when the page loads, we do the commands inside {}. Then, invar contract;const contractAddress = \u201c0x9abd5ea4f8fd7194efa51a3435bfceb24acbee31\u201d;we initialize some variables that we will be needing in the later part of the code. Make sure you change the value of contractAddress to your own deployed contract address. You can find it in the Terminal/CMD where you did truffle deploy, somewhere in this part:Following that part is an async() call definition stored to const contractMessage:const contractMessage = async () => { contract = new web3.eth.Contract(abi, contractAddress); let message = await contract.methods.getMessage().call(); return message;}Here, we first get our contract instance using our ABI (the one we stored in abi.js), and contractAddress (the one we got from deploying our contract). Then, we call our smart contract\u2019s getMessage() method by doing contract.methods.getMessage().call(). Finally, we return the message.Now, on this next part:if (window.ethereum) {  window.web3 = new Web3(ethereum);  try {    // Request account access if needed    await ethereum.enable();    var message = await contractMessage();    var elm = document.getElementById(\u201cmessage\u201d);    elm.innerHTML = message;  } catch (error) {    // User denied account access\u2026  }} else { // Non-dapp browsers\u2026  console.log(\u2018Non-Ethereum browser detected. You should consider trying MetaMask!\u2019);}```We first check if the browser being used supports Ethereum transactions. If not, we display a console message saying so, but if it does, then we do several commands.Basically, we get the message by calling the async() call that we previously defined, named contractMessage(). And then, we set the text being displayed in the <div> tag with the ID, message.Now, all that\u2019s left is setting MetaMask to connect to our locally running Ethereum client with ganache-cli.MetaMask ConnectionFirst, open the Terminal/CMD that you used to run ganache-cli, and scroll up a bit until you see the part that shows a list of private keys. Ganache basically gives us 10 accounts with 100 ETH each, which we can use in MetaMask. The list of private keys looks like this:Now copy any of them (just one), and open your browser (make sure you already have MetaMask installed). Open MetaMask, and change the Network to Localhost 8545.Then, click on the icon beside the Network dropdown, and click Import Account. You should now see that MetaMask will ask for a private key.Now you\u2019ll have an account in MetaMask with ~100 ETH. Time to open our simple web app!Starting the Web AppNow, using the Terminal/CMD where you did truffle deploy, do the following:cd srclive-serverWe\u2019re just navigating to our src folder, and using live-server to run our very basic web app. You\u2019ll now notice that we got the message we put in our smart contract!You might encounter a MetaMask pop-up window that asks for access permission though. You should just click the \u2018Connect\u2019 button right here:We\u2019re done! Easy! You should now be able to see the text from our smart contract, being displayed on the page like this:ConclusionWe\u2019ve only touched on the basic usage of Truffle for local development.Perhaps the next steps you can take are either improving the current web app to also call setMessage(), or start using Truffle Boxes for the development of your next dapp.\u2019til the next tutorial!openberry is a tutorial marketplace, designed to allow anyone to learn blockchain programming.openberry | blockchain tutorialAnyone using openberry can become a blockchain engineer.

This article is intended to provide you with a comprehensive overview on how to configure your project so you can deploy your contracts to the main network, test networks (Ropsten, Rinkeby, Kovan) or private network faster and effortlessly without the need to run your own Ethereum node. I assume that you already have Truffle installed on your machine and know the basic commands (init, compile, migrate, etc). Without further ado let\u2019s jump into the article.Obtaining Infura API keysInfura provides an access to the Ethereum network, so you don\u2019t have to run your own node. Signup on Infura (enter your name, email and password) and you will receive an email message with your API keys. We will use them later.Downloading GanacheGanache is a simulation of a private Ethereum blockchain. It is very useful to for testing your DApp at the early stage, as you can have instant transactions (no need to wait for the confirmations). Make sure to download it and get familiar with its interface.Ganache user interfaceSetting up Truffle projectIf currently you don\u2019t have your Truffle project, you can follow me and start with a fresh Pet Shop project.Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you want this project to be located. Then, run this command to initiate a new project with some boilerplate code:truffle unbox pet-shopRun the server:npm run devYou should be able to see your project running on localhost (if not, make sure that Ganache is running).But what if you want to test your DApp on a more realistic simulation or even on the main Ethereum network? I hope you have heard about test networks like Ropsten, Rinkeby or Kovan. These are the simulations of the real Ethereum network, where you can test your smart contracts in a realistic environment without spending real Ether.Adding different networks to the configurationFirst, you will need a HD Wallet-enabled Web3 provider. Run the installation command:npm install truffle-hdwallet-providerOpen truffle.js file on your favorite text editor. I am using (and highly recommending) Sublime Text (+ Solidity highlighting plugin for developing smart contracts).First, include the required module:var HDWalletProvider = require(\u201ctruffle-hdwallet-provider\u201d);Then, you need to declare your mnemonic phrases. You can use default Ganache phrases, but I would not recommend that, as everyone has access to these accounts and you can not use it for Ethereum mainnet (for obvious reason). What I would recommend is to add a Metamask extension to your browser and create an account there. Please make sure to backup your phrases somewhere safe and then add it to the configuration file:var mnemonic = \"candy maple cake sugar pudding cream honey rich smooth crumble sweet treat\"; // replace with your own phrasesNote: it is not recommended to leave it as a plain text in the final production version, but we will cover that later.Next, add a configuration for different networks. Add a comma in module.exports after the development network and declare a configuration for other networks (do not forget to replace your-api-key with the actual API keys from Infura):ropsten: {      provider: function() {        return new HDWalletProvider(mnemonic, \"https://ropsten.infura.io/your-api-key\");      },      network_id: 3    },    rinkeby: {      provider: function() {        return new HDWalletProvider(mnemonic, \"https://rinkeby.infura.io/your-api-key\");      },      network_id: 4    },    kovan: {      provider: function() {        return new HDWalletProvider(mnemonic, \"https://kovan.infura.io/your-api-key\");      },      network_id: 42    },    main: {      provider: function() {        return new HDWalletProvider(mnemonic, \"https://mainnet.infura.io/your-api-key\");      },      network_id: 1    }Also, for each network I like to explicitly declare gas limit and price (put it after network_id):gasPrice: 20000000000, // 20 GWEIgas: 3716887 // gas limit, set any number you wantThis is optional, but it is very useful when you are deploying to the main network, as it makes sure you are not overpaying and the transaction will be provided with a reasonable amount of gas. To test how much gas the deployment costs, I use Remix IDE.Here is the final truffle.js file:var HDWalletProvider = require(\"truffle-hdwallet-provider\");var mnemonic = \"candy maple cake sugar pudding cream honey rich smooth crumble sweet treat\";module.exports = {  // See <http://truffleframework.com/docs/advanced/configuration>  // for more about customizing your Truffle configuration!  networks: {    development: {      host: \"127.0.0.1\",      port: 7545,      network_id: \"*\" // Match any network id    }, ropsten: {      provider: function() {        return new HDWalletProvider(mnemonic, \"https://ropsten.infura.io/your-api-key\");      },      network_id: 3,      gasPrice: 20000000000,      gas: 3716887    },    rinkeby: {      provider: function() {        return new HDWalletProvider(mnemonic, \"https://rinkeby.infura.io/your-api-key\");      },      network_id: 4,      gasPrice: 20000000000,      gas: 3716887    },    kovan: {      provider: function() {        return new HDWalletProvider(mnemonic, \"https://kovan.infura.io/your-api-key\");      },      network_id: 42,      gasPrice: 20000000000,      gas: 3716887    },    main: {      provider: function() {        return new HDWalletProvider(mnemonic, \"https://mainnet.infura.io/your-api-key\");      },      network_id: 1,      gasPrice: 20000000000, // 20 GWEI      gas: 3716887    // gas limit, set any number you want    }  }};Now you are ready to deploy your DApp to any of these networks!Deploying to different networksTo deploy your contracts on Ropsten, run:truffle migrate --network ropstenRinkeby:truffle migrate --network rinkebyKovan:truffle migrate --network kovanMain network:truffle migrate --network mainMake sure you have some Ether on every network. If you get \u201cNetwork up to date\u201d message, add reset flag, for example:truffle migrate --reset --network ropstenIf you get \u201cexceeds block gas limit\u201d message, try to adjust the gas limit (as I mentioned earlier, you can use Remix to see how much gas is needed for deployment).If you do not specify a network, the default one is development. You can track your transactions on Etherscan.Bonus: storing mnemonic in a separate placeMaybe you are working with a team using git and have your project uploaded online or at some point you are planning to open source it. Storing your mnemonic online is not the safest option, as if someone knows it, they have access to all your funds on these accounts.A simple solution is to add mnemonic as an environment variable and replace hard-coded values:var mnemonic = process.env.MNEMONIC;Find a way to add environment variable to your OS (it may differ in Windows, Linux and Mac) and enjoy the safer way to access your mnemonic phrases.Adding new environment variable in Windows 10That\u2019s all!

Where do you start?Without further ado, here comes the step-by-step guide.While this article is primarily for Mac users, it should be similar on Windows.Pre-requisitesYou\u2019ll need these:Truffle Framework: npm install -g truffle@4.1.13Ganache: Download and install the GUI ClientGithub: You may clone the repo to speed up the tutorial.Truffle is the framework we\u2019ll use to help us easily manage and deploy our Solidity codes. Ganache runs a local instance of the Ethereum network for our testing purposes.Note that since Truffle and Solidity are quite version sensitive, doing this tutorial with a different Truffle version other than 4.1.13 might break.Step 1: Start GanacheWhen Ganache is started, you will see 10 Ethereum addresses automatically generated for you. These are the wallets that we can test against later.By default, Ganache starts at http://127.0.0.1:7545. Take note of this address.Ganache GUI ClientStep 2: Initialize TruffleLet\u2019s create a new folder for our demo project and initialize Truffle Framework inside. Open up your terminal and type:cd ~/Ethereummkdir democd demotruffle initYou should see a couple of files being injected by Truffle in the demo folder.Step 3: Create Demo ContractOpen up the demo project in your favorite editor, create a new file called Demo.sol inside the contracts folder. Paste the following codes into Demo.sol:pragma solidity ^0.4.23;contract Demo { uint public balance; // Initialize global variables constructor() public  {  balance = 0; } // The payable keyword allows this function to accept Ether function contribute() public payable {  // msg.value is the value of Ether sent in a transaction  balance += msg.value; }}Here, we have a very simple smart contract where it has a contribute function that takes in Ether and update its balance.Step 4: Add a New MigrationIn order to deploy our Demo contract to our test Ethereum network on Ganache, we need a migration script.Inside migrations folder, create a new file called 2_demo_migration.js. The 2_ prefix is important so that Truffle knows it\u2019s the step 2 of all the migration steps for this project.Paste the following codes:var Demo = artifacts.require(\"./Demo.sol\");module.exports = function(deployer) {  // Demo is the contract's name  deployer.deploy(Demo);};Step 5: Update the ConfigurationsOpen up truffle-config.js , paste the following codes:module.exports = {  networks: {  development: {   // from: \"\", // Defaults to first address from Ganache    host: \"127.0.0.1\",     port: 7545,    network_id: \"*\"  }  }};Step 6: Deploy!Now we are ready to deploy to Ganache for testing. Let\u2019s do it! Open up your terminal and type:truffle deployOnce it\u2019s done, let\u2019s check our Ganache. You should see a few transactions being recorded:2 contracts are generated by our deployment due to us having 2 migrations, with 1 being the default Truffle Framework\u2019s migration.For our Demo contract, we need to check the second transaction from the top (circled in blue). Click on it, and copy the contract address (circled below) for our next step.Step 7: Interact with Our Demo ContractNow that the Demo contract is deployed, we want to play around with it. Truffle provides a nice console tool for this purpose. Open up your terminal and type:truffle consoleOnce you are inside the console, type Demo (the name of our contract) and you should see some data dump on our contract. But that\u2019s not very useful, let\u2019s type these instead into your terminal:var dm; Demo.at(\"0x85365158Ed31cF2d8D9E8c070898d19419eA5B6E\").then( function(x) { dm = x });Here, the 0x85365158Ed31cF2d8D9E8c00708981d9419eA5B6Eis the contract address that you needed to copy in Step 6.We assigned this instance of the Democontract to the variable dm so that we can manipulate the contract easily afterwards.Step 7a: Check the BalanceNow let\u2019s check our balance, which supposed to be 0:dm.balance().then( function(x) { return x.toString(); });Step 7b: Let\u2019s Add Some EtherFirst you\u2019ll need to copy one of the wallet address in Ganache. Let\u2019s take the third wallet for this:Accounts screen in GanacheNow to transfer the money from our wallet to our Demo smart contract, we will need to run this command in the console:dm.contribute({from:\"0x3e08faaf30F2B04B1AD7851Eaac01534d8Cda1bB\", value: 10000000000000000000});Here we are sending 10000000000000000000 wei (or 10 ether) from our third wallet to the smart contract. You should see some data dump on screen if it\u2019s successful.Note: 1 ether = 10\u00b9\u2078 wei. See: https://etherconverter.online/Step 7c: Check the Balance AgainNext let\u2019s check our balance, do you see 10000000000000000000?dm.balance().then( function(x) { return x.toString(); });ClosingNow that you have just created your first smart contract, deployed it to a local testnet and even made some transaction, hopefully this quick example has provided you some foundation to work on the more advance topics in the future.A few things to note before we go:Ganache is not persistent. Once you restart the app, all the addresses and transactions will be reset.You need to re-deploy every change you make in your contract. The simplest way to do so in the local testnet is by usingtruffle deploy --reset. This will also create a new instance of your smart contract.All the codes used for this demo is available at Github.

Out-of-the-box it offers a test setup, easy integration with front-end code, and a migration tool.Migrations are probably the most challenging part of the framework to understand. To me they resemble database migrations from Ruby on Rails, but there might be older prior art of this pattern.Truffle migrations allow the developer to roll out new smart contracts, or change contracts, in a controlled manner.When the developer wants to change or deploy a contract, they create a new migration using the \u201ctruffle create migration <name>\u201d command. Truffle will create a new migration file and prefix the filename with the current timestamp in milliseconds. This timestamp is the version of the migration.When executing migrations, the Truffle migrate command will first check the last migration version for the network, and then run any migrations that are newer. The latest version is stored in a Migration contract on the network. The first thing that Truffle migrate does is deploy the Migration contract. The address of this contract is stored in it\u2019s Truffle compiler artifact (i.e. under \u201cbuild/contracts/Migration.json\u201d).But wait: the Truffle compilation artifacts contain some things specific to my local filesystem (i.e. the \u201csourcePath\u201d property), and the bytecode changes whenever a smart contract changes. As a developer I do *not* want to commit those build artifacts.So- that leaves us in a lurch. I don\u2019t want to commit the compilation artifacts, and yet we need the artifacts to know the address of the Migration contract.Truffle Migration LimitationsDependence on Compilation ArtifactsWhen Truffle compiles a contract it creates a corresponding JSON file that contains the contract metadata. It includes the bytecode, local filesystem location, deployed addresses for each network, and AST among other things. A good developer shouldn\u2019t commit generated files or files containing specifics to their setup. However, the address of the Migration contract needs to be known so that new migrations can be run correctly. When upgrading a global network such as Ropsten, where do we store this data?Permanence of ContractsWhen developing contracts I always use Ganache to run a local Ethereum network. Using a local node means changes are fast and free and I don\u2019t pollute the global test nets. I can reset the local node without harm, and the contracts will disappear. When I\u2019m ready to deploy to Ropsten or another global test net I can run the migrations against that network.However, when deploying to a global test net such as Ropsten the deployed contract addresses are stored in the transient compilation artifact; if I don\u2019t record them manually then the addresses vanish into the ether.Contracts that are deployed to global test nets are permanent and should have addresses and ABIs published as part of the project.Separation of ConcernsThe compilation artifact for a contract contains the addresses for the most recent deployments on all networks. However, if the contract is re-deployed to one network and the other network is still listed, then the other network will have different bytecode and potentially a mis-matched ABI. The network addresses should be linked to the specific ABI and bytecode that is deployed at that location.Truffle Off-chain MigrationsI iterated on the existing truffle-migrate code and created a new tool called truffle-migrate-off-chain. It addresses several, but not all, of the above concerns.This new tool stores migrations entirely off-chain. Each network has a network config JSON file that includes the migrationVersion as well as a list of all the contracts that have been deployed to the network. There is no more Migrations.sol contract.Here is an example network config for Ropsten under networks/3.json:The \u2018contracts\u2019 array simply holds a list of every deployed contract on that network, in order. It does not *yet* include the ABI, as I wanted the library to integrate cleanly with the existing Truffle infrastructure.When migrations are run against a particular network, the network config is checked for the migration version, and any newly deployed contracts are added to the list of contracts for the network.After migrations are run, the compilation artifacts are updated to include the latest network addresses. This means that your front-end code can stay the same and just pull in the existing compilation artifact! It\u2019s important to note that these addresses are derived from the network configs.Now, when I deploy to my local Ethereum node (network id 1234) it will create a file under networks/1234.json. I can add that file to .gitignore so that the local network information is excluded, and commit the Ropsten network (networks/3.json) to Git.ConclusionThis library has made my continuous deployment pipeline so much simpler. I hope that other people find this project useful. The truffle-migrate-off-chain package works perfectly as a drop-in replacement, but there are some additional features I\u2019d love to add (although they would require altering truffle-contract).I would love to hear opinions on this as I\u2019m sure there are plenty, and any feedback or suggestions to the library are appreciated.Thank you.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Truffle", "Software Development", "Blockchain Development", "Blockchain"]}, {"title": "Integrating Zeppelin OS with Truffle", "post_link": "https://medium.com/coinmonks/integrating-zeppelin-os-with-truffle-841e89fa34b3?source=search_post", "author_name": "Brendan Asselstine", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@asselstine", "publish_date": "2018-11-30", "last_modified_date": "2019-02-14", "readtime": "3.49", "claps": 86, "voters": 7, "content": "Integrating Zeppelin OS with TruffleBrendan AsselstineFollowNov 30, 2018 \u00b7 4 min readtldr; easily integrate Zeppelin OS into an existing Truffle-based project using a migration pattern and Zeppelin OS to Truffle merge command. You can find a mirror of the tutorial and example code on GithubZeppelin OS is a tool that manages contract deployment, upgrades, and packaging. It even cleverly detects and warns about memory structure changes in upgradeable contracts. With very little effort you can make all of your contracts upgradeable and enjoy an easy-to-use command line tool to manage them. It\u2019s essential.ZOS is designed to integrate with Truffle; a well-regarded suite of tools that allow one to easily migrate, deploy and test smart contracts.MigrationsZOS handles contract upgrades, but doesn\u2019t go so far as to directly support Truffle migrations. Migrations are valuable because they capture deployment logic in discrete, versioned steps. Developers can add new migrations and incrementally migrate their environment.To integrate Truffle migrations with Zeppelin OS, we\u2019ll need to take care of two major issues:Contracts must be instantiated using Zeppelin OS by a separate \u2018administrator\u2019 account. Zeppelin OS separates the role of contract \u2018administrator\u2019 and contract \u2018user\u2019: the administrator is the one who creates and upgrades the target contracts and the user is anyone who calls the original contract functions. Zeppelin calls this the transparent proxy pattern.Truffle migrations rely on the version as stored in the deployed Migrations contract. If the build artifacts are re-created we need to merge the addresses from the zos.*.json file into the Truffle artifacts.Let\u2019s take care of these two steps.Project SetupThe complete code is on Github, but if you\u2019d like to follow along you can run these commands to setup your project:In a separate terminal start ganache-cli:Now you will be able to follow the article.Separating Contract Creation from Privileged InteractionMany contracts define a special address as being the \u2018owner\u2019. The owner of a contract is able to use privileged administrative functions: such as mint on an ERC20 contract. ZOS does not allow the proxy admin to interact with the contract, so the owner cannot deploy the contract. We'll need to adapt our migrations so that a separate 'proxy admin' account actually deploys the contract.Having multiple transaction signing accounts introduces an added wrinkle: we now need more than one account \u2018unlocked\u2019 in the Truffle network config. For our local ganache-cli that's not a problem because the first ten accounts are unlocked in ganache-cli, but for a test network such as Ropsten we need to unlock them manually.Truffle Network ConfigThe truffle-hdwallet-provider allows one to unlock multiple addresses using an offset and count as it\u2019s third and fourth parameters:We\u2019ve unlocked address[0] and address[1]. Since Truffle uses the first address to update the migration version, let's use the second address as the proxy admin.Migrations.solOur first migration to update will be the 1_initial_migration.js that comes with every Truffle project. It deploys the Migrations contract that Truffle depends on for migration versioning. The Migrations.sol contract will need to be updated to be compatible with ZOS. Notice that we're using Ownable.sol from the openzeppelin-eth module, which is a special branch of the OpenZeppelin library that integrates with ZOS.Next we\u2019ll need to update the 1_initial_migration.js script to use ZOS. I prefer using the shell commands, but ZOS does offer a JavaScript API.Notice that we\u2019re initializing the contract using the inherited function initialize(address _owner) with accounts[0].CallMeMaybe.solTo complete the picture, let\u2019s add an arbitrary contract where we need call a function in a migration:Let\u2019s add two migrations for CallMeMaybe, the first to create it and the second to set it (arbitrary example).This demonstrates the integration with Truffle: we can simply pull in the contract artifacts as we do normally and call them.The contracts and migrations are done! Now let\u2019s run them.Running the MigrationsAssuming accounts[0] (owner) is 0x2c1e88eeb8a1aa907dcaa141f8a930565637ff57 and accounts[1] (proxy admin) is 0x81ff0179eeb3545e7d9a0e80672ea9ba88d68817 let's now deploy our contract:Check the name using the Truffle console:Merging Addresses back into Truffle Artifacts: zos-truffle-mergeWhen the Truffle build artifacts are destroyed and re-created, they lose all of the address information from Zeppelin. To merge the address information back into the files you can use a handy tool I wrote call zos-truffle-merge.To merge ZOS addresses from Ropsten back into the artifacts:This will merge the deployed contract addresses defined in zos.ropsten.json into the Truffle artifacts in build/contracts for the network id 3.Zeppelin OS has added this feature to their backlog, so this command may eventually be replaced with built-in functionality.SummaryI greatly enjoy working with Zeppelin OS and Truffle; the two tools are a powerful combination. If you\u2019re a Truffle user I hope this article helps you transition to using Zeppelin OS, as I think people can benefit from it greatly.Medium: Brendan AsselstineGithub: https://github.com/asselstineTwitter: @b_asselstineClick to read today\u2019s top story", "responses": 3, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Zeppelin", "Openzeppelin", "Truffle", "Solidity"]}, {"title": "Black gold: hunting precious Perigord truffles in Queensland\u2019s Granite Belt", "post_link": "https://medium.com/tradeandinvestmentqld/black-gold-hunting-precious-perigord-truffles-in-queenslands-granite-belt-a73e89adc94a?source=search_post", "author_name": "TradeandInvestmentQld", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@tradeinvestqld", "publish_date": "2018-02-20", "last_modified_date": "2018-08-02", "readtime": "4.71", "claps": 70, "voters": 8, "content": "Black gold: hunting precious Perigord truffles in Queensland\u2019s Granite BeltTruffle hunter Matt Hibberd explains the seductive power of the Perigord, how our truffles end up in Asia, and why it\u2019s all about the dogTradeandInvestmentQldFollowFeb 20, 2018 \u00b7 5 min readTruffle dog Conan raring to go \u2026 (Photo credit: Daniel Wells)Matt, let\u2019s start with truffles for dummies. What IS a truffle, and what do truffles taste like?Truffles are a fungus and are part of the mushroom family \u2014 but they grow below the surface, not above.French black truffles usually have an earthy mushroom type of flavour and white Italian truffles have a more delicate flavour, with a hint of garlic and onion. People have varying reactions \u2014 some love the taste and aroma of truffles, whereas others think they\u2019re \u2018expensive dirt\u2019!Truffles have a reputation for being high-end and exclusive. How much do truffles sell for?Truffles usually retail for about $2.50-$3.00 a gram. One truffle can weigh anything from 10 grams to 150 grams, so an individual truffle could range from $25 to $300 depending on its size. Remember, though, it only takes a few small slices of truffle to flavour or garnish a dish.Buying truffles is as delicate as the fungus itself. Truffles lose moisture and weight from the moment they are picked and stored, so it\u2019s important to buy and eat them as fresh as possible.Most people associate truffles with the oak forests of France. When did people start cultivating truffles in Australia, and where could we find truffles Down Under?The first truffle commercially harvested in Australia was in Tasmania in 1999. Over the last 20 years there have been commercial forests established in colder parts of Western Australia, New South Wales, Victoria, the ACT, and here in Stanthorpe on Queensland\u2019s very frosty Granite Belt.How does the quality of an Oz truffle measure up to the French version?The process of inoculating plant roots with the French Black Perigord spores doesn\u2019t vary around the world, so truffles should taste pretty much the same everywhere. Having said that, our Australian product is generally very highly regarded, due to our clean soils, air and rain. Western Australia is actually now one of the biggest truffle-producing regions in the world.Can you tell us a bit about your own truffle enterprise at Stanthorpe in south-east Queensland?Queensland truffle growers are generally very secretive because of their concerns about biosecurity and theft. With no other truffle ventures open to the public, we opened our Truffle Discovery Centre at Stanthorpe last winter to cater to Queensland truffle fans.French black Perigord truffles can sell for up to $300 each.What do you do at the Truffle Discovery Centre?We have two display truffle plantations, with a mix of hazelnut and English oak trees purchased from one of the two places in Australia that has a patent to coat the roots of the seedlings with truffle spores.In about 4 years we hope to have our first crop of French black Perigord truffles and then every winter for about 50 years. Some of our clients in the region have also inoculated trees with Italian white truffle spores and may begin harvesting them from this coming winter, which will be an Australian first. Sometimes only one in five trees will produce a truffle, or a cluster of truffles, which is why truffles are a very rare and expensive delicacy.At the Truffle Discovery Centre, we offer guided tours of our two plantations, and we also run displays of our truffle detection dogs at work.We\u2019re all familiar with images of pigs snuffling for truffles in French forests. What\u2019s the story with truffle dogs?Pigs are naturally attracted to the smell of truffles underground because the smell of the truffles is similar to the smell of a pig hormone \u2014 sort of a pig aphrodisiac! But commercial farmers don\u2019t actually want pigs eating their truffles, so our truffle areas are fenced to stop wild pigs coming in and feasting.Dogs are widely used on truffle farms because most dogs do not like the smell or taste of truffles \u2014 although I did see a Labrador eating truffles in Tasmania but, hey, Labradors eat everything! Trained dogs will show us they\u2019ve found a truffle for the reward of their toy appearing out of our pocket.We\u2019ve trained a few dogs that now work on local farms. Some farmers bring their dog to us for training, and we have our own dog, Conan, who heads out with me as a hired truffle hunter during winter. He\u2019s a mastiff-cross from a rescue organisation, which is where most of our detection dogs come from.I take Conan through a row of trees in a commercial truffiere, he smells the ground and, if he smells truffles, he shows me that we need to dig.Who are the main local customers for Queensland truffles at the moment?Chefs and home cooks right around South East Queensland buy truffles during winter. Our truffle-infused Australian olive oils and Granite Belt honeys are now an extension of the truffle product and allow us to have retail truffle products for sale year-round. They\u2019re getting more popular all the time.Matt Hibberd and Conan ready to start a demo at Stanthorpe\u2019s Truffle Discovery Centre.How about the export market for Queensland truffles? What\u2019s happening now and what lies ahead?The truly wonderful thing about truffles as a product is that we have global demand all year but truffles are only available in winter in both hemispheres. That means we have strong export demand for Australian truffles during our winter when other countries are in summer.Currently there is strong direct demand from Asia for truffles grown on the Southern and Darling Downs, and that\u2019s supported by a weekly flight from Wellcamp Airport at Toowoomba to Hong Kong.Most truffles in Australia are currently grown on small hobby farms, but that\u2019s starting to change. There are now a few large commercial ventures being undertaken, with thousands of trees being planted. Two of those are very close to Stanthorpe and the Granite Belt.Growers are starting to talk about the need for a co-op to be established to coordinate the cost-effective export of large orders to Asia and Europe where price and demand are strongest and on a scale to be rewarding for the farmer.I think we have exciting times ahead for Queensland\u2019s truffle industry.Stanthorpe will host the Tartufo Truffle Fest on Sunday 5 August 2018.If you liked this article, please click the \ud83d\udc4f button below to make it easier for others to find.Trade and Investment Queensland is the Queensland government\u2019s global business agency, helping Queensland exporters take their products to world markets, and promoting Queensland as the perfect place for investment.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Truffle", "Queensland", "Export", "Stanthorpe", "Matt Hibberd"]}, {"title": "MythX for Truffle: Painless Smart Contract Security Testing", "post_link": "https://medium.com/consensys-diligence/mythx-and-truffle-security-painless-smart-contract-security-testing-6d0fe5e938da?source=search_post", "author_name": "Nathan", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@nathan.peercy", "publish_date": "2019-03-11", "last_modified_date": "2019-03-26", "readtime": "3.49", "claps": 149, "voters": 6, "content": "MythX for Truffle: Painless Smart Contract Security TestingNathanFollowMar 11 \u00b7 4 min readThis article gives an introduction to the MythX security analysis plugin for Truffle.Do you develop smart contracts? Would you like to be able to check your contract for vulnerabilities without sacrificing your other responsibilities?This article will introduce you to MythX for Truffle. MythX for Truffle extends the Truffle framework to be able to leverage the MythX platform to test contracts for security holes. It creates actionable reports for your smart contracts to help you remove easy-to-miss weaknesses and vulnerabilities.Setting up MythX for TruffleMythX for Truffle is a Truffle plugin, and uses MythX on the back end to inspect your smart contracts for security vulnerabilities. It makes testing your smart contracts for security holes as simple as running a single command.You can follow along with this vulnerable Truffle project or use your own.First, install the truffle-security package:$ npm install -g truffle-securityCurrently, Truffle plugins are enabled on a per-project basis. In the future, truffle plans on having a global configuration. For now, add the plugin to truffle-config.js in the root directory of your Truffle project:module.exports = {    ...    plugins: [ \"truffle-security\" ]};Truffle allows you to set a specific compiler version for the contracts that you are analyzing, if needed. The contracts in the example project use solc 0.5.5, so ensure that the compiler is specified in truffle-config.js.module.exports = {    ...    compilers: {        solc: {            version: \"0.5.5\",        }    }}Using MythX for TruffleYou are now ready to analyze your contracts:$ truffle run verifyOutput of the MythX plugin for TruffleTo be sure you have access to the full, unlimited results, you will need to set up a free account on the MythX website. You will specify an Ethereum address and create a password. Sign up is free.(During the beta, access will remain completely free. Paid plans will eventually be available with fewer restrictions, but there will always be a free option.)Once you have obtained credentials, set the environment variables MYTHX_ETH_ADDRESS and MYTHX_PASSWORD. If you are using .bashrc, you can add the following lines::export MYTHX_ETH_ADDRESS=0x1234567891235678900000000000000000000000export MYTHX_PASSWORD='Put your password in here!'Understanding the resultsVulnerabilities in the IntegerOverflowMul contractFor the IntegerOverflowMul contract, MythX for Truffle reports an overflow at line 10.1  //Single transaction overflow2  //Post-transaction effect: overflow escapes to publicly-readable storage3  4  pragma solidity 0.5.5;5  6  contract IntegerOverflowMul {7      uint public count = 2;8  9      function run(uint256 input) public {10         count *= input;11     }12 }As all math in Solidity is mod 2\u00b2\u2075\u2076, count can be overflowed here with a large enough input. For example, if input was 2\u00b2\u2075\u2076 - 1, count will be set to (2\u00b2\u2075\u2076 - 1) * 2 % 2\u00b2\u2075\u2076, which isn\u2019t might not be what is expected. One way to prevent an integer overflow like this is to use OpenZeppelin\u2019s SafeMath.Each analysis result reports a n SWC ID. For example, the SWC ID for an integer overflow is SWC-101. The Smart Contract Weakness Registry is a resource containing examples and descriptions of smart contract vulnerabilities. If you are unsure about any reported vulnerability, look it up in the registry to understand the bug.Details about SWC-120: \u201cWeak Sources of Randomness from Chain Attributes\u201dFuture Plans and DirectionsThe MythX team is planning more integrations beyond just Truffle. MythX analysis is currently being integrated into several IDEs including VSCode and Remix. We are planning on integrating MythX in popular CI solutions as well.In addition, we are offering a 25% revenue share to developers who create their own MythX integrations, so we hope to see many more integrations after the 1.0 release. The library used by MythX for Truffle and the upcoming VSCode Solidity extension will be made available for developers wanting to write code with MythX or to write integrations.ConclusionMythX for Truffle is valuable for every smart contract developer. It helps keep your code secure throughout the entire development process and reveals vulnerabilities the moment they are introduced.Automated analysis can never replace a professional manual audit, but consistent use of automated analysis tools will certainly make the audit simpler, less painful, and cheaper.UPDATE: We have published a video showing how to use the MythX for Truffle plugin.

Truffle University solves a unique need \u2014 advanced topics in Ethereum for experienced developers \u2014 versus others like the Consensys Blockchain Developer Course, which provides a technical introduction to Ethereum and the basics of smart contract development.The Comprehensive ReviewI\u2019m a web developer from their inaugural cohort (June 2019) and with this post, I\u2019ll try to outline what Truffle University offers and how it compares to my experience at Consensys\u2019 Ethereum Developer Bootcamp. My goal here is to help you form expectations. These are purely my opinions\u2014 I didn\u2019t receive compensation from anyone.So what does Truffle University offer? You\u2019ve probably read their marketing:We\u2019re building a world class training program to turn you, an existing software developer, into a professional paid blockchain engineer. You\u2019ll learn the in\u2019s and out\u2019s of blockchain development, from theory to practice, becoming fully proficient with Truffle\u2019s entire suite of tools. After you\u2019ve completed the program, you\u2019ll be referred to our exclusive partner network with over 50 companies vying for the best blockchain talent.Truffle University screens applicants for both software development experience and a baseline understanding of Etherum. You should know how to use Truffle and you should understand the paradigm shift involved with building on Ethereum versus traditional software. If you\u2019re looking for an in-depth introduction to Ethereum, I recommend Coursera\u2019s Blockchain: Foundations and Use Cases (free, non-technical) or Consensys\u2019 Blockchain Developer Bootcamp ($1K, highly technical).Course StructureTruffle University is a 6-week course, with 3-hour classes (mostly slide decks via Zoom screen share) twice per week. Each class offers a deep dive on a given topic, for instance, Gas in Ethereum: how it works, the cost of different opcodes, and how to adapt your code structure or logic to minimize gas costs. The sessions usually include a presentation from a Truffle Suite core developer, followed by Q&A.The course is entirely project-based \u2014 there\u2019s no homework or exercises or prep reading for any given class. Students can build their own independent project (here\u2019s mine) or choose to contribute to Truffle Suite\u2019s open-source projects, such as Truffle, Ganache or Drizzle, with guidance from their team.Where Truffle University ExcelsProfessional developer supportTruffle University provides a Slack channel with direct access to Truffle developers throughout the course. This is HUGE for troubleshooting and mentorship! For example, I doubt I would have ever discovered how to interact with Ethereum\u2019s mainnet in my local development environment without their team as a resource (thanks again, Mike Seese!). Definitely the most valuable feature of Truffle University.Peer collaborationThe small class size (30 students in my cohort with only half in each class, vs. hundreds of students in my Consensys Bootcamp cohort) and the upfront screening Truffle University performs (they actually decline unqualified applicants, unlike the Consensys Bootcamp) allows for legitimate collaboration with a bright, diverse peer group. One-on-one discussions and code reviews with fellow classmates provides valuable project feedback.Alumni networkAgain, the upfront screening Truffle University performs makes for high-quality classmates. I value the connections I\u2019ve made. Truffle also facilitates ways for our group to keep in touch, including continued access to our Slack channel and monthly Zoom sessions for us all to share new learnings.Where Truffle University FailsGeneral organizationOverall, the course was a bit chaotic. I had the impression the course goals, the curriculum, and the hiring partner network were all being built on the fly. In their defense, while interviewing as a student for their first cohort, I was warned that Truffle University was an early work in progress. I give kudos to Truffle for covering our cohort\u2019s tuition while they ironed out the kinks. I respect their bias towards action in pushing it into the open vs. over-preparing in the dark. I don\u2019t expect this to be an ongoing issue as the program matures.CurriculumThe class topics felt a bit scattered. Sometimes the subject of a class changed less than a day or two ahead of time (my guess is they had trouble coordinating guest developer\u2019s schedules), which made it more difficult to prep for any upcoming topic. One class, our instructor even warned the slide deck was \u201cvery beta\u201d. An advantage of this lack of structure was that the curriculum was quite flexible. The instructors were always receptive to feedback and keen to offer any particular subjects that we wanted to cover.The curriculum also had a strong enterprise focus, including fully dedicated sessions to \u201cEnterprise Ethereum\u201d with Pegasys and \u201cManaged Blockchain Services\u201d with Kaleido, both products for private/consortium chains. I was turned off by this but perhaps it\u2019s an area of interest for other developers (please leave a comment below if so!) and perhaps that\u2019s where most of the blockchain jobs are? My hunch is that Truffle University simply favors other Consensys projects in the course material (one example: trumpeting the \u201cIMPAKT stack\u201d, which includes Consensys\u2019 Pegasys as the \u201cP\u201d to cover Ethereum clients despite Geth and Parity being by far the most popular clients). I found this annoying but reasonable considering it\u2019s likely easier for them to bring core developers from those teams to present to us. Just note that Truffle is a for-profit enterprise with roots in Consensys, a company that has a monetary incentive for developers to build on its products.Providing an on-ramp to employmentThis is another area I think Truffle will quickly solve but the upfront claims of connecting graduates to \u201chiring partners\u201d did not pan out. The networking opportunities they provided at the end of the course were access to Hired and Indeed Prime profiles, both of which are free online services.Caveat \u2014 I did find employment on my own shortly after graduating, so resources here may have improved since.SummaryI had an excellent experience and highly recommend this course. The direct access to Truffle developers and collaboration opportunities with like-minded peers made this a worthwhile time investment. You\u2019ll obviously have to take the tuition fees into account (I\u2019m not sure what the cost of the program is \u2014 they sponsored this first cohort) but my hunch is that it will be worth it.

Here is how we got that error and the main symptoms of it :1- Contract code does pass all tests in truffle (write as much tests as you can think about even if it takes longer! it is a life saver)2- Deployment on TestRPC = A1, perfect no error whatsoever3- Deployment with Geth on Testnet = A1, perfect also4- Deployment with Geth on Mainnet = Migrations contract hangs, then dies with the : Contract not found at Block 50 error. Need to say about 1 hour of patiently waiting to get that error, and Nothing on etherscan with the txid.Wow! What the hell happened ? It was working everywhere why isn\u2019t it working on mainnet ?After countless hours of debugging, hundreds of google search, posting on communities forums and chats (gitter, slack) there was no answer. Nobody seems to know how to fix that.To find the solution we did use Parity and the included Dapp that shows you what is been deployed and if it is or not. Very useful for debugging as you can see other contracts on the network too.Soooo\u2026 what did we found ? That truffle is never sending the right amount of gas to the Network. We did follow truffle documentation to the letter like probably most of you did. Unfortunately that documentation has some flaws and is not very up-to-date with the latest truffle and its bugs.The problem seems very complicated at first (we were 3 senior developers searching WHY!). However the solution is quite simple.Modify your truffle.js or equivalent file and add the following to your network :(\u2026 usual network stuff here),gas: 4712388,gasPrice: 25000000000See all those zeros ? We are all used to put something like 21000 in there\u2026 well that doesn\u2019t work ;) The minimum gas price at the time of this writting is around 24 shannon. So if you put 21000 you dont even get 1 shannon. And that is why the error comes and times out. Your transaction is never picked up by the EVM because your gas was too low ! That simple !Hope this did help you and feel free to share if it did so other people who did encounter the same problem can sort it out finally !If you found this fix useful any donations are welcome ;) Did cost me $200 and a night of sleep to come up with that !

Welcome to the edition of the blockchain dev digest for the week where Vitalik Buterin dropped the rhymes in Australia.This episode is dominated by news about ZK libraries advancements and Truffle updates. Last but not least, we have an article from 0xcert, showing how one can approach testing their smart contracts on mainnet.Tools and Libraries updatesTruffle Teams + Truffle 5.0.12Resource: https://truffleframework.com/teamshttps://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/releases/tag/v5.0.12The Truffle group had two main news this week. First of all, Truffle 5.0.12 is now released. The release contains improvements on the documentation, the CLI behaviour of unbox and a fix of an issue with the debugger. If you try to place a breakpoint on a blank line or variable declaration, the debugger will now automatically advance to the next stoppable point.Second, Truffle Teams was unveiled. Truffle teams is a continuous integration solution for teams using truffle. With it you will share common compilation and unit testing environment and streamline your delivery process.websnarkResource: https://www.iden3.io/post/websnark-zksnarks-generation-browser-now-fast-and-easyOne of the best companies working on ZeroKnowledge area has released a new library \u2014 websnark. It is a library to generate zero knowledge proofs from the web browser. This library is fully written in web assembly and allows you to generate zero knowledge proof from the browser (desktop or mobile) in a few seconds in the most common use cases.Among others, those usages include: anonymous voting, anonymous transfers, proving of a claim without revealing your identity, etc.ZoKrates Latest ReleaseResource: https://medium.com/zokrates/building-identity-linked-zksnarks-with-zokrates-a36085cdd40ZoKrates, the toolbox for ZkSNARKs for Ethereum has released a new version. The new version comes with inbuilt Elliptic Curve Cryptography for the ZoKrates language. You can now easily create proofs that you know the private key of a certain public key.In addition and as a nice transition to the next section, the ZoKrates team gives a tutorial on how one can prove the knowledge of a certain private key without showing it and tying it to their identity.Knowledge sharingTesting smart contracts live without spending gasResource: https://0xcert.org/news/live-testing-smart-contracts-with-estimategas-william-entriken-tadej-vengust/The 0xcert team has written a very nice tutorial showing a technique that allows you to test any deployed contract in arbitrary ways, without spending gas.The tutorial includes techniques such as using \u201cestimategas\u201d, The singleton transaction pattern, stubs and artifacts.Like what you read and perhaps curious about what LimeChain is up to?Follow us on:https://twitter.com/GSpasovhttps://twitter.com/LimeChainHQhttps://twitter.com/etherlimehttps://limechain.tech/Sources:Latest Week in EthereumThe latest Week in Ethereum News is: https://weekinethereumnews.com/february-8-2019/www.weekinethereum.comr/ethdevr/ethdev: Ethereum-related dev talk: Contracts, DApps, Wallets, Clients, Infrastructure, Tooling, UIs, Patterns, and\u2026www.reddit.comThanks to all the people that have messaged me about the news this week!About the author: George Spasov, Co-founder and Blockchain Architect @LimeChain, has developed a multitude of blockchain projects \u2014 public and private \u2014 and is a prominent member of several blockchains communities.

There are several competing frameworks in the Ethereum space these days but Truffle is the market leader and most commonly used so it\u2019s definitely worth keeping an \ud83d\udc40 on what\u2019s going on over at Truffle HQ.We have been using Truffle extensively for well over 18 months now, switching from a raw Web3JS library to a full build pipeline favouring features such as testing suite integration, CLI tools, multi-network support and deployment tools to name just a few.We have had some small gripes with Truffle 4 but it has served us well over the last year but with the recent release of Truffle 5 the itch to upgrade was getting to us. We went for it and below are some of the best and worst bits which we found on the path to Truffle 5.Web3JS 1.0 \u2705Truffle now come bundled with the latest Web3JS, this has a host of new additions but the one we love the most is the ability for us to use the PromiEvent construct when dealing with transactions, for example:This is a much more fluent way of handling submission of transactions to the network. Previous all we had was a simple Promise which unfortunately doesn\u2019t always fit when there are several states which a transaction can end up in. Previously, we used to use hacks like listening for events and timers checking every X seconds to work around this, the recent changes make it feel right.Async/Await \u2705All Web3 calls are async/await \u2014 either when using them in tests, migrations or a webapp \u2014 this just makes life easier in most scenarios.Additional Network Config \u2705Additional configuration options works well for us, we often price transactions at the lower end as we don\u2019t always need them to go through immediately, with the new config we can increase the timeout and block confirmation, for example:This means we can be more confident about running a migration and not worrying about it timing, which did happen with Truffle 4 migrations.Revert Reason Strings \u2705A long overdue addition \u2014 bringing the latest changes to Solidity and Web3 to Truffle. Tests can now validate the failure reason and frontend logic can surface this reason if desired.This has allowed us to tighten up our test and in one occasion find a false positive. Also surfacing some of these reasons to the frontend when needed is a big win for diagnosing potential issues.BigNumber.js to BN.js \ud83d\ude20The change to switch from BigNumber.js to BN.js took us by surprise. The majority of the time it took us to upgrade was going through the thousands of tests we have which utilised BigNumber and convert them to BN.js \u2014 I understand than the inclusion of web3 1.0 forced this move I just wished there was an easier way to do it. I have also found issues with using BN.js with bn-chai with should.js as detailed here.Explicit conversion from ASCII to HEX \ud83d\ude20This seems like an unnecessary change, presumably Truffle knows the method args and signature when making a call so I think the new requirement for explicitly converting to to HEX seems like a unneeded change, ideally it would the the type conversions for me in some way.Function arguments of type bytes must now be converted to hexadecimal bytestrings using web3.utils.asciiToHex().ConclusionTo conclude the latest Truffle 5 release is a vast improvement and should be considered by all those running production ready Truffle deployments. All those involved should be proud of the many thousands of hours and commits which have gone into the release. Above are only some of the new features which we love and we are planning to explore and utilise many more of them in the future.We will continue to use and support Truffle and see a very positive future in it.

This tool is open source and the source code can be found here.SETUPThe Ganache tool can be downloaded here and you can have a full list of releases here. For the Linux folks out there, there is a small twist in that the package to be download as it is in AppImage format. Apart from the fact that it is a relatively new format, launching it is very easy.The steps involved are as follows:After having downloaded the Ganache file, give it executable rights by doing `chmod u+x ganache-1.0.1-x86_64.AppImage` (or the corresponding version that you have).Launch the app by doing `./ganache-1.0.1-x86_64.AppImage`User InterfaceGanache welcome screenAs soon as Ganache is launched, it will display a list of 10 addresses with a default balance of 100.00 ETH. The interface allows you to view and work with the following sections:Accounts \u2014 displays a list of addresses which can be used in the Ethereum blockchain instance. You have the ability to click on the key icon to reveal the private key for the address (bear in mind that in the mainnet, you need to keep this key private, hence its name).Blocks \u2014 a list of blocks on the blockchain. Clicking on the block will open more details on the clicked block including the mined on date and block hash.Transactions \u2014 the transaction tab will provide a list of all transactions in this instance of the blockchain.Logs \u2014 this tab provides us with a descriptive list of logs related to the actions on the private blockchain.Settings \u2014 clicking on the top-right settings icon will open the settings view which will allow you to change the configuration including the hostname, port number, network ID, set defaults for the number of accounts/keys to create, gas limit and gas price. After any changes, you have the ability to restart the instance.Settings page for GanacheConclusionGanache seems to be a very nice tool to have to set up an ethereum node to get started with blockchain development. There is no need to set up a geth client, set up dependencies and so on. Downloading and installing this tool is enough to get started with Ethereum development, which is very nice for people who are starting to learn Blockchain or Ethereum development. When I started working on Ethereum with Codevigor to develop a Tamper-Proof system for document authentication on StoragePlus.io, it was a bit daunting. Having such a tool is definitely going to be much easier for other developers.Have fun!!Feel free to post your questions.

The application is a statically hosted single page vuejs app with a smart contract running on the Rinkeby testnet.The following is my development story starting with the Wish.sol smart contract.The full project repo can be found here: https://github.com/mattlockyer/wishereum-projectRemix to Truffle to TestsThe first step I took when developing my smart contract was to gather all the requirements for my app:A user can make a wish and throw away some ETHA wish object contains the address, ETH amount and wish stringA user can retrieve their own wishesA user can retrieve all wishesOnly the owner can get or send the balance of ETH in the smart contractThe next step was to hit up the remix editor from the ethereum foundation. Having already learned some Solidity development from reading the docs and tutorials online, I quickly came up with a minimum viable contract for my application.pragma solidity ^0.4.11;contract Wish {    //Wish Object  struct WishStruct {    string wish;    uint256 amount;    address wisher;  }    //public  WishStruct[] public wishes;  uint256 public totalWishes;    //private  uint256 private balance;  address private owner;  mapping(address => uint256[]) private indicies;    //modifiers  modifier onlyOwner() {    require(msg.sender == owner);    _;  }  //constructor  function Wish() {    owner = msg.sender;  }    //payable  function() payable {    balance += msg.value;  }    /**************************************  * public methods  **************************************/  function makeWish(string wish) payable returns (bool) {    if (msg.value < 1 finney) revert();    balance += msg.value;    indicies[msg.sender].push(wishes.length);    wishes.push(WishStruct(wish, msg.value, msg.sender));    totalWishes = wishes.length;    return true;  }    function getIndicies() constant returns (uint256[]) {    return indicies[msg.sender];  }    /**************************************  * private (onlyOwner) methods  **************************************/  function getBalance() onlyOwner constant returns (uint256) {    return balance;  }    function sendBalance(address dest) onlyOwner {    dest.transfer(balance);    balance = 0;  }    }Fields ExplainedStarting from the top the first thing I define is WishStruct. Since everything in the blockchain costs money, you need to define minimal structs with your main constraint being efficient retrieval of objects, so no nested queries. Even though calls to the blockchain are \u201cfree\u201d, they are slow. If made through light client APIs like MetaMask or Parity extensions, you really don\u2019t want to abuse them. Best practice is to store the response locally so the client isn\u2019t refetching (something I\u2019ll go into in another post).Next I define the public array of all WishStruct objects wishes. Public variables are compiled with getters which means you can use .call from any web3 implementation to get the value. When calling arrays you must provide the index so it will look something like this on the frontend:const wish = await wishContract.wishes.call(index);Next I define the totalWishes uint to keep track of how many wishes there are total. So let\u2019s say a client visited the site for the first time, they would grab the total number of wishes and then load each wish object by index.There are a couple of fields for managing the balance of ETH in the smart contract and the owner, fairly standard.The last field is a private mapping of address to uint[]. I tried to make this public and use the generated getter but it didn\u2019t work so instead I opted for a constant function.function getIndicies() constant returns (uint256[]) {  return indicies[msg.sender];}Handling Use CasesGiven this contract, how does it serve the use cases I originally drafted?The makeWish function is payable so you can send ETH along with some data.The WishStruct contains all information needed to display a single instance without making anymore calls to the blockchain.A user can fetch only their wishes by first calling getIndicies which returns a uint array of the indicies of only their wishes. They can then fetch each wish object.By using the totalWishes uint a user can cycle through all (or part) of the wishes array and get wish objects.The balance functions are protected by a modifier so only the owner can move the balance.Even Simple Can Be DifficultDespite being a very simple contract, there are likely still vulnerabilities I am not aware of. For example a short address attack might be possible on some of the functions, I am not checking the data payload length to make sure it is genuine.Warning: I am not a security expert and you should always have your contracts audited by a third party before deploying to the mainnet.Enter TruffleThe next step in checking that my contract behaves as expected was to boot up truffle in my development directory and write some tests.truffle initRename a few files, MetaCoin -> Wish.sol etc\u2026So I end up with:/  contracts/Wish.sol  test/wish.jsUpdate the migrations file 2_deploy_contracts.js to the following:const Wish = artifacts.require(\"./Wish.sol\");module.exports = function(deployer) {  deployer.deploy(Wish);};Copy and paste the contract from Remix to Wish.sol and then run:truffle compileCheck if everything went as planned. If so, dive into the tests.Mocha + Chai Truffle TestsI\u2019ve already written a post on writing truffle tests so I won\u2019t go into too much detail here but the basic javascript tests for Wish.sol are here:const Wish = artifacts.require(\"./Wish.sol\");contract('Wish', (accounts) => {    let wish;  const owner = accounts[0];  const random = accounts[1];  const finney = 1000000000000000;it('should have a deployed address', async () => {    wish = await Wish.deployed();    assert(wish !== undefined, 'wish contract should be defined');  });it('should have an initial balance of zero', async () => {    const balance = await wish.getBalance.call();    assert(balance.toNumber() === 0, 'balance should be zero');  });it('non-owner cannot get balance', async () => {    try {      const balance = await wish.getBalance.call({ from: random });    } catch (e) {      assert(true, 'non-owner cannot get balance');    }  });    /**************************************  * Wishes  **************************************/it('should have undefined tx if amount too low', async () => {    let tx;    try {      tx = await wish.makeWish('random wish', { value: finney - 1, from: random });    } catch (e) {      console.log('exception caught');    }    assert(tx === undefined, 'non-owner cannot get balance');  });    it('make a lot of wishes', async () => {    let tx;    for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {      tx = await wish.makeWish('random wish number ' + (i+1), { value: finney, from: random });      assert(tx !== undefined, 'wish transaction');      tx = await wish.makeWish('owner wish number ' + (i+1), { value: finney, from: owner });      assert(tx !== undefined, 'wish transaction');    }    assert(true, 'wishes made');  });      it('should return the random users wishes', async () => {    const indicies = await wish.getIndicies.call({ from: random });    for (let i in indicies) {      const w = await wish.wishes.call(indicies[i].toNumber());    }    assert(true, 'wishes returned');  });    it('should return last 10 wishes', async () => {    const totalWishes = await wish.totalWishes.call();    for (let i = totalWishes - 1; i >= totalWishes - 10; i--) {      const w = await wish.wishes.call(i);      console.log(w[0]);    }    assert(true, 'wishes returned');  });});You can run these tests using truffle test but you\u2019ll have to also be running testrpc at the same time.What happens each time truffle runs a test is that it will compile the contracts again, deploy them to the test blockchain of testrpc and in your test you will be able to reference the latest instance using Artifact.deployed() where the Artifact is your contract artifact. The artifact.require step is a convenience method to load the json in your /build and wrap it in a TruffleContract instance for testing.RecapBefore doing any of this, sketch out your idea, use cases and some UI / UX user flows. Identify all the cases and then list out a minimal schema for your contract.Note: there\u2019s also the off-chain on-chain question / debate ongoing. My personal opinion leans toward storing minimal amounts of information on the blockchain and fetching resources from elsewhere using UUIDs and hashes.Once you have your schema and a basic idea of the functions in your contract, I highly recommend starting in the remix editor, keeping your contract(s) as minimal as possible, then moving to Truffle and TestRPC locally and writing tests.Go forth, code some law or invent some money.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Dapps", "Blockchain", "Solidity", "Truffle"]}, {"title": "BlockNotary Team Develops Best Truffle-based Ethereum App", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@blocknotary/blocknotary-team-develops-best-truffle-based-ethereum-app-2a9d3eda16d2?source=search_post", "author_name": "Block Notary", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@blocknotary", "publish_date": "2016-05-03", "last_modified_date": "2018-03-13", "readtime": "1.35", "claps": 13, "voters": 6, "content": "BlockNotary Team Develops Best Truffle-based Ethereum AppBlock NotaryFollowMay 3, 2016 \u00b7 2 min readOver the course of Consensus 2016 Hackathon in New York, BlockNotary team has won ConsenSys\u2019s prize for the best solution created in Truffle environment for Ethereum developers.

I will also discuss setting up MetaMask. MetaMask allows users to run Ethereum dApps (Decentralized Applications) in the browser without running a full Ethereum node. MetaMask includes a secure identity vault, provides a user interface to manage the identities on different sites and sign blockchain transactions.We will create a smart contract where there is a string \u2014 name. We will initialize the default value and will get ( getName() ) and update ( setName() ) the values after deploying the smart contract.Softwares:1. Install ATOM IDE from https://ide.atom.io/2. Install npm, nodeJS, nvm.3. [OPTIONAL] Use ATOM\u2019s package manager and download packages for Solidity.4. [OPTIONAL]Install MetaMask extension in ChromeSetting up:1. Set up truffle npm install -g truffle2. Create a new directory and cd into it mkdir ethereum; cd ethereum3. A good way to understand the working and structure is by unboxing a truffle box. Truffle boxes are available at https://truffleframework.com/boxes.We can unbox using -truffle unbox BOX_NAME Replace BOX_NAME with any box (eg- metacoin)Here, we will set up the basic structure using -truffle initScreen Capture showing the commands4. Open truffle.js file and set your configPlace the following snippet in your truffle.js file -module.exports = { // See <http://truffleframework.com/docs/advanced/configuration> // for more about customizing your Truffle configuration! networks: { development: { host: \u201c127.0.0.1\u201d, port: 8545, network_id: \u201c*\u201d // Match any network id } }};This points to localhost(127.0.0.1) and port 85455. Install solc which provides JS bindings for Solidity Compiler -npm install -g solc Verify installation using - npm -g ls|grep solc6. Install Ganache Ganache can be used to fire up a personal Ethereum blockchain to run tests, execute commands, and inspect state while controlling how the chain operates.npm install -g ganache-cliNote: You can also download ganache software and install it. Skip Step 7 in that case. Go to settings in ganache software and update port to 8545 (Default is 7545).7. In a new terminal, execute - ganache-cli This will run the personal Ethereum blockchain on port 8545 by default.You can pass different parameters to specify a different value.Execute ganache-cli --help to learn about different flags.Eg- -p for Port number to listen on[default: 8545] -h for Hostname to listen on -g for the price of gas in wei [default: 20000000000] -l for the block gas limit in weiNote: 1 ETHER = 10\u00b9\u2078 weiYou will observe the following in your terminal \u2014karan@DESKTOP-1PPH4LK:~$ ganache-cliGanache CLI v6.1.8 (ganache-core: 2.2.1)eth_blockNumberAvailable Accounts==================(0) 0x1d3eb9ee26a02be8bf8e9d308542707cc0534817 (~100 ETH)(1) 0xd50afcddad16ac980f6c0b0525c1a07092fc5e09 (~100 ETH)(2) 0x9424ea1ecf6741c463a81f6a4fc209d0047dc726 (~100 ETH)(3) 0xad2517003654076cf73dbe66d4547c8fd414d948 (~100 ETH)(4) 0xcb2bf0998b1e1830531f9e9abf91e7194f68134f (~100 ETH)(5) 0xa07ae9b3582122d2ff8b3e37126ebf5ffac92cc8 (~100 ETH)(6) 0xc29e6e7b444fea62e9b4aea407cdc4f34eb12178 (~100 ETH)(7) 0x57462bf4020a6c139d43d77d1b60b24459ada164 (~100 ETH)(8) 0xa8dfb5a77b1a133b8bf1ab2d0398d9c21c2320fa (~100 ETH)(9) 0xa8870deea40b83c5ef4feb634d009892edf5f841 (~100 ETH)Private Keys==================(0) 0xcd12baae33031428c747428b4731aba78aefde2fb9f24a31a18d3fae37780209(1) 0x8ba634fe7d842bb516d130b31f0a4eefd3e58c935269762c780ff1d3b1f576e1(2) 0x2fa620e83f35469ccca63de00c1f4e0a139e01711697feb291432264d5c80a5b(3) 0x7b48ef3a72d38c45db605f47ff61bb7db90301f460fd7a24f9e5786437dbc7f2(4) 0x8a6f4ba253e18f3ed042a2497d470476c3ff1c0e198dad2690a6016ed1bf0c11(5) 0xea72514e18ee2ac30ca2814710f3a312285e5b1d7ad8596fb49aa100954e510f(6) 0x97ac0ef1d3a11a90121909f61599002952752e5399f2e2105e707d645b5c9b4e(7) 0xce7ca10b97f4b2dd220edc9e2ed73976c5cd7c62105842b42a308ec956991e95(8) 0x7d6c0167e3ba91eda42a8ac010093464b0a7446a69ab11fe4f086c74c2f2efb6(9) 0x830dc538d80d228aa01b83bb9732b6e43bf2e1fc790a5d26821c5e55817be0deHD Wallet==================Mnemonic: modify ball connect catch giant provide garlic zero sea bulk risk retreatBase HD Path: m/44'/60'/0'/0/{account_index}Gas Price==================20000000000Gas Limit==================6721975Listening on 127.0.0.1:85458.

Open MetaMask extension and click on Import Using Existing Seed Phrase.Enter the mnemonic and set your password. Select localhost 8545 as the network. You will get 100ETH in your account. You can import other accounts by going to import account on MetaMask. Enter one of the private keys you obtained in your terminal.Select Import AccountNote: We will not be utilizing these ETH for the purpose of the demo. These coins can be used with other truffle boxes like \u2014 TutorialToken.(Refer: https://truffleframework.com/tutorials/robust-smart-contracts-with-openzeppelin)You can import multiple accounts using different private keys and transfer ETH between different accounts.Reference: Filip Martinsson\u2019s youtube video covers this basic tutorial in a simple way without using ganache by executing all the commands in truffle develop.Thanks for reading.

No? Well maybe you should give it a try, because that\u2019s the code name of Truffle\u2019s new version 5.0!It\u2019s still a beta release, but the list of new features is mouthwatering (see what I did there?), so I\u2019m going to highlight a couple of ones that I liked the most:1. Choose Your Compiler: Not only is Truffle is evolving, but also Solidity is as well, and sometimes both present breaking changes (e.g. Solidity\u2019s new keyword \u2018constructor\u2019); so it\u2019s important to be able to change the compiler version that Truffle uses with the flick of a switch. Truffle is so good to us that it will list the compiler versions that it supports, and fetch it for you so you can use it in your project!Now inside truffle-config.js:2. Display Proper Error Messages: Didn\u2019t you love it when your front-end users used to get a \u2018revert\u2019 error that was so cryptic that Hollywood could use it in a sequel to Russell Crowe\u2019s \u201cA Beautiful Mind\u201d?Solidity 0.4.22 gave us the ability to supply error messages to \u2018revert\u2019 and \u2018require\u2019, but with a catch: support by tooling is still pending; so it wasn\u2019t quite useful at the time. Now Truffle with its new version 5.0 is one of those tools that support this feature. It\u2019s a work in progress though, so currently they only support it for their ganache-cli client (version 6.1.3 and up); below is how it looks in practice:Solidity:NodeJS:As you can see, those are some really cool features;

As development goes on, a more rapid approach may be required sooner or later.This post explains how to connect the Ethereum development framework Truffle to a Quorum Blockchain network running on SAP Cloud Platform. The instructions are based on the official Truffle tutorial BUILDING DAPPS FOR QUORUM: PRIVATE ENTERPRISE BLOCKCHAINS.PrerequisitesNode.js and NPMhttps://nodejs.org/en/download/Free Quorum instance on SAP Cloud PlatformSCP offers access to a free, shared instance using the \u201cdev\u201d plan. Read my previous post on how to get it.Note: Some of the commands (such as tree) in the post may only work on Unix-like systems such as Linux or MacOS. Similar commands may exist for Windows.Meet TruffleTruffle is a command line tool that simplifies the development process of Ethereum smart contracts. A couple of the most important features are:Management of multiple smart contractsSmart contract deployment & migrationsManagement of multiple blockchain networksEthereum package managementInstallation of TruffleNode.js and NPM are required to install Truffle. The following command installs the Truffle command line tool globally.$ npm install -g truffleCreate a Truffle projectIt is a good practice to put a Truffle project into a separate folder. The following commands create a directory and change the working directory.$ mkdir my-project$ cd my-projectNext, the Truffle tool can be used to initialize the project. The Unix command tree helps to understand which files and directories are created. For more information on the file structure, please refer to the Truffle documentation.$ truffle init$ tree.\u251c\u2500\u2500 contracts\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 Migrations.sol\u251c\u2500\u2500 migrations\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 1_initial_migration.js\u251c\u2500\u2500 test\u2514\u2500\u2500 truffle-config.js3 directories, 3 filesThe later steps in the example require the installation of additional NPM packages. The following command initializes an NPM module and creates a package.json and a package-lock.json to track this Truffle project\u2019s dependencies.$ npm initConnect Truffle to Quorum on SAP Cloud PlatformTruffle is typically connected to a local Ethereum instance using the \u201clocalhost\u201d host name and a port. Quorum instances on SAP Cloud Platform run on a shared port and are secured with an API key. Therefore a custom \u201cprovider\u201d is required to allow the use of a full URL.HDWalletProviderThe HDWalletProvider (\u201cHD\u201d stands for Hierarchical Deterministic) is an open source provider package that was originally made for public, shared Ethereum instances (such as Infura) where the account is held separate from the Ethereum node. HDWalletProvider takes a mnemonic string (a space-separated string of twelve words a human can remember) and derives a private key that constitutes the account. Since the HDWalletProvider is simple to use, it is used for this example.The following command installs HDWalletProvider via NPM and adds it to the project\u2019s package.json:$ npm install truffle-hdwallet-provider --saveConfigure Truffle to use Quorum on SAP Cloud PlatformThe following code snippet configures Truffle using the truffle-config.js file to use the RPC URL and the mnemonic string. The URL can be retrieved from the instance\u2019s dashboard on SAP Cloud Platform. The mnemonic string can be arbitrarily chosen or can be generated using this website.Please note that the code below is just an example. Never hard code the mnemonic string or the RPC URL.// Import HDWalletProviderconst HDWalletProvider = require('truffle-hdwallet-provider')// mnemonic string is secret, consider reading an environment variableconst mnemonic = 'idle belt cliff rough reward forest talent coffee bread describe legal fork'// RPC URL is secret, consider reading an environment variableconst rpcUrl = 'https://...'module.exports = {  networks: {    development: {      // Provider has to be wrapped into a function      provider: () => new HDWalletProvider(mnemonic, rpcUrl),      // Match any network id      network_id: \"*\",      // Since Quorum is used, gas price can be set to 0      gasPrice: 0,      // Gas limit      gas: 4500000    }  }}Compile, deploy and test Solidity contractNow that Truffle is installed and set up, the contract can be created. This example uses the same SimpleStorage contract that was used in the previous post. The constructor initializes an integer value that can be changed at a later point using the set function and read using the get function.Solidity contract compilationCreate a new file with the name SimpleStorage.sol in the contracts directory and paste the following Solidity code:pragma solidity ^0.5.0;contract SimpleStorage {    uint public storedData;        constructor (uint initVal) public {        storedData = initVal;    }        function set(uint x) public {        storedData = x;    }        function get() public view returns (uint retVal) {        return storedData;    }}Next, verify the successful local compilation of the contract:$ truffle compileCompiling ./contracts/Migrations.sol...Compiling ./contracts/SimpleStorage.sol...Writing artifacts to ./build/contractsThe SimpleStorage smart contract should now compile successfully on the local device.Deploy smart contract to Quorum BlockchainTo deploy a contract with Truffle, a migration is required. Create a file with the name 2_deploy_simplestorage.js in the migrations folder with the following content:const SimpleStorage = artifacts.require(\"SimpleStorage\");module.exports = function(deployer) {  // Pass 42 to the contract as the first constructor parameter  deployer.deploy(SimpleStorage, 42)}The migration script loads the SimpleStorage contract and deploys it to the configured Ethereum instance with the initial integer value \u201c42\u201d. To execute the migrations, run the following command:$ truffle migrate...2_deploy_simplestorage.js=========================Deploying 'SimpleStorage'   -------------------------   > transaction hash:    0xf043d8a233f8ab0b462b93666fec79a5937359f07e7bece910d2f6ac7996c2bc   > Blocks: 0            Seconds: 0   > contract address:    0xc711e03859383294DCa9383397CaA67AEd4D030f   > account:             0xC38995a435d3A7DD6c5D7641AD6aEb197446c1b2   > balance:             0   > gas used:            122661   > gas price:           0 gwei   > value sent:          0 ETH   > total cost:          0 ETH> Saving migration to chain.   > Saving artifacts   -------------------------------------   > Total cost:                   0 ETHThe transaction did not cost anything because the gasPrice was set to zero in the network configuration above. Unlike Ethereum, Quorum allows users to not pay any Ether for gas. Also note that gas was still used and the transaction would have failed if more gas than the gas limit was used (see the gas property in the network configuration).Write unit tests for the contractUnit tests can be written in both JavaScript and Solidity. The example uses JavaScript and leverages the Mocha framework. The async/await notation of JavaScript is used to improve readability:const SimpleStorage = artifacts.require(\"SimpleStorage\");contract(\"SimpleStorage\", async accounts => {  it(\"should write a value and read it back\", async () => {    // Retrieve contract instance    let instance = await SimpleStorage.deployed()    // Write to contract    await instance.set.sendTransaction(9999, { from: accounts[0] })    // Read from contract    let value = await instance.get.call()    assert.equal(value.valueOf(), 9999)  })})The tests can be executed using the following command:$ truffle testUsing network 'development'.Contract: SimpleStorage    \u2713 should write a value and read it back (2899ms)1 passing (3s)Additional resourcesHow to get a free Quorum instance on SAP Cloud Platform and deploy a smart contract:https://medium.com/@mitchkunzmann/sap-cloud-platform-now-supports-quorum-in-addition-to-hyperledger-fabric-and-multichain-75f4f9628c2dQuorum on SAP Cloud Platform documentation:https://help.sap.com/viewer/product/QUORUM/BLOCKCHAIN/en-USTruffle documentation:https://truffleframework.com/docs/truffle/overviewFollow me on social media for weekly content around Blockchain and other technologieshttps://twitter.com/mitchkmanhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-kunzmann-4345a491/", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Quorum", "Blockchain", "Sap", "Sap Cloud Platform"]}, {"title": "How to write and deploy first smart contract in Solidity 0.5.x and Truffle 5.x.x", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@paulina.blaszk/how-to-write-and-deploy-first-smart-contract-in-solidity-0-5-x-and-truffle-5-x-x-3054ec5328ad?source=search_post", "author_name": "Paulina B\u0142aszkiewicz", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@paulina.blaszk", "publish_date": "2019-03-10", "last_modified_date": "2019-07-22", "readtime": "7.58", "claps": 6, "voters": 5, "content": "How to write and deploy first smart contract in Solidity 0.5.x and Truffle 5.x.xPaulina B\u0142aszkiewiczFollowMar 10 \u00b7 8 min readIf you want to start your adventure with the Solidity language, first you need to set up an essential development environment for creating smart contracts. We will use Truffle version 5.0.6 and Solidity 0.5.0.Source: pexels.com1. Setting up smart contracts environment1.1 Node.js and npm installationNode.js is installed in a package with npm and can be downloaded from https://nodejs.org/en/.If you do not remember whether you already have Node.js and npm, you want to check the version or make sure that the installation has been carried out correctly \u2014 run the console command:node -vnpm -v1.2 Truffle installationTruffle is the most popular framework for Ethereum. To install Truffle globally on your computer run the command in the consolenpm install -g truffleorsudo npm install -g truffleNow we can check our Truffle version by running in the console:truffle versionI\u2019m using right now:Truffle v5.0.6 (core: 5.0.6)Solidity v0.5.0 (solc-js)Node v11.6.0The latest Truffle version you can check at https://www.npmjs.com/package/truffle.1.3. Ganache installationGanache is a local blockchain network for development purposes. It is convenient to use and it has a friendly interface. You can download it from ganache page.1.4 Code editor for smart contracts in SolidityTo start coding, you need an editor with an extension for Solidity language, so that you can use syntax highlighting or snippets. Personally, I recommend:Visual Studio Code \u2014 with the solidity extension (currently I use it),Atom \u2014 with language-ethereum extensionOf course, you can simply choose your favorite code editor \u2014 the most popular have available packages for Solidity, for example:Sublime text \u2014 with Ethereum extensionMore examples of integration you can find in the Solidity documentation.2. Creating a first smart contractOur environment for creating smart contracts is prepared, so it\u2019s time to go to the most interesting part and write the first smart contract in Solidity.We will create a very simple contract \u201cHello\u201d. Our main assumptions:we have three state variables \u2014 the name, the age and the Ethereum address of the owner,the owner can add/change the name and the age,everyone can get the value of state variables.2.1 Project initiationFirst, we create a folder and initiate Truffle there.mkdir hello-soliditycd hello-soliditytruffle initIf everything goes well, we receive information: Unbox successful. Sweet!In the folder of our project, we can find now files and folders generated during the initiation. Truffle project structure looks as follows:Folders:contracts \u2014 in this folder we place our smart contract files. Currently, there is a contract named Migrations.sol. It was created automatically and is responsible for the migration process in Truffle. Usually, there is no need to modify it.migrations \u2014 this folder contains the file 1_initial_migartion.js, which is responsible for deploying the Migrations.sol contract. We will add here a file with configuration for our smart contract.test \u2014 according to the name we place test files here (information on how to write tests will be in one of the next entries)Files:truffle.config.js \u2014 Truffle configuration file, where we place settings regarding, among others, blockchain networks that we use, the selected version of the solc compiler, etc. An example configuration is below.2.2. Truffle configuration \u2014 truffle.config.js fileThis file contains basic configuration settings allowing for the creation and implementation of smart contracts. It may require minor modification depending on the settings in Ganache. The default network used by Truffle is development. We should check if the port is compatible with the one indicated by Ganache. If not \u2014 you should change the port in truffle.config.js to the correct one (or you can change the port in the Ganache settings).In the truffle.config.js file, you can also choose the version of the compiler (solc) you want to use. In our case, we will set it to 0.5.0.Due to a Medium issue \u2014 the github code is not displayed in Safari. Use a different browser to view all content2.4 Choosing the compiler version \u2014 pragma solidityIn the Contracts folder, we create a new file and call it Hello.sol (extension .sol applies to smart contracts in Solidity). At the very top, we start by specifying the version of the compiler that should be used to compile our file. We use pragma solidity expression.pragma solidity ^0.5.0;In our case, this means that the minimum version of the compiler needed to compile our smart contract is 0.5.0. \u201c^\u201d means we can\u2019t use the version higher 0.5.X. If we use the compiler in version 0.6.X (or higher), it through an error. Why? When upgrading to version 0.5.1 or 0.5.7, the changes shouldn\u2019t disrupt our contract running, but in the upgrade to 0.6.X changes can be breaking.Important! The specific version of the compiler in smart contract inform us what version of the compiler is needed to compile our code. It does not change the version used by Truffle compiler \u2014 to do this you need to change the settings for Truffle in the file truffle.config.js2.5 Smart contract \u2014 name and state variables declarationNow we can finally write our Hello contract. We start with the word \u201ccontract\u201d and then indicate its name. In our case, smart contract name coincides with the file name.In the beginning, inside a smart contract, we start with state variables declarations. Solidity is a statically typed language. First, we define the type of the variable and then its name. In our case, it will be a state variable owner holding the Ethereum address of the contract owner and string name with our name.pragma solidity ^0.5.0;contract Hello {    address private owner;    string private name;}In the smart contract we can also define other types of variables:bool \u2014 logical type,int or uint \u2014 numeric types,contract,array,struct,enum,mapping.More information about data types, you can find in the Solidity documentation.2.6 ConstructorBelow the variables, we define a constructor \u2014 function called when deploying a smart contract in a blockchain network. In our constructor, we assign to the \u201cowner\u201d the Ethereum address which called deploy. This is \u201cmsg.sender\u201d that determine the sender of the current message. The constructor is optional. We do not need to use it in our smart contract if we do not want our contract to perform any activities immediately after creation.constructor () public {    owner = msg.sender;}2.7 Types of visibility (public, private, external, internal)There are four visibility types: public, private, external and internal. We have to specify the type for all variables and functions. For simplicity, assume that in our smart contract all variables are private (it does not mean that they are invisible to other users of the blockchain), and all functions are public. The Solidity documentation precisely explains all types.2.8 Smart contract functionsIn our contract, we will create the following functions:setName \u2014 sets a new value to the variable namefunction setName (string memory _name) public {    require (msg.sender == owner, \u201cYou are not the owner!\u201d);    name = _name;}getName \u2014 gets the value of the variable namefunction getName() public view returns (string memory) {    return name;}sayHello \u2014 gets your greeting textfunction sayHello()    public    view    returns (string memory, string memory){    return (\u201cHello Solidity! My name is:\u201d, name);}For functions that do not modify any states \u2014 in our case, they will be getName() and sayHello() \u2014 we add the \u201cview\u201d type after the visibility type.In addition, we specify a data location for the function parameters (passed or returned by the function):memory \u2014 its lifetime is limited to a function call,storage \u2014 the place where the state variables are stored,calldata \u2014 the location of special data.Our first smart contract is ready and looks like this:Due to a Medium issue \u2014 the github code is not displayed in Safari. Use a different browser to view all content3. Compiling and deploying smart contract. Implementation on the local Ganache blockchain3.1 Adding a smart contract migration fileIn the migrations folder, we create a new file named 2_deploy_contracts.js where we define the smart contract that we want to deploy during migrations. In our case, where we have one smart contract, the content of this file will look like this:var Hello = artifacts.require (\u201cHello.sol\u201d);module.exports = function (deployer) {    deployer.deploy (Hello);};3.2 Smart contract deploymentFirst of all, we need to make sure that our local blockchain network \u2014 Ganache is running. Then we go to the console and run the command:truffle compileIn this way, we check whether our smart contract compiles correctly. If everything is correct, we see will such a message:We can check now that in the location of our project, build folder was created, during compilation. We can find there also contracts folder, containing compiled versions of our smart contracts in .json format.If everything compiles correctly, we can deploy our smart contract to our Ganache blockchain using:truffle migrateThis command starts migrations to run the deployment process. As a result, we receive information about the correct migration. We can find there, among others address of our smart contract.During the work on a smart contract in a local network, I often use the command:truffle migrate --reset --compile-allIt causes that after smart contracts modifications, we force to recompile and migrate all of the contracts (not only those with changes) \u2014 this command sometimes helps to avoid emerging errors.3.3 Interactions with the smart contractTo communicate with our smart contract, we will use the Truffle console. We run it with the command:truffle consoleNow the truffle (development) mode should appear in our console (to exit we use ctrl+c).In the beginning, we save the instance of Hello contract in the app variable: Hello.deployed().Then((instance)=>{app = instance;})Now, by entering the app in truffle console, we can display our smart contract instance.Then we add our name to the state variable name:app.setName(\u201cPaulina\u201d)We check the result of this operation by calling our next function getName ()app.getName()We got the value of our name, so now we can say hello to Solidity:app.sayHello()and we receiveGreat job! We have just created and deployed to the blockchain simple smart contract.

To setup your system with necessary dependencies refer to my previous article and setup your system to begin developing your first dapp.Before we dive into the development, let me give you an overview about the architecture of Ethereum Dapp we are going to develop and how different puzzles are going to fit into the picture. So let\u2019s start the journey to build your Ethereum DApp.What are Ethereum Dapps?Dapps are the decentralized applications that runs on a peer-to-peer network unlike traditional web apps that runs on centralized servers. When these dapps are built over ethereum network, these are known as \u201cethereum dapps\u201d. In decentralized apps, all the users\u2019 data is stored on immutable distributed ledger and every participating nodes have a copy of that ledger. These dapps logic that runs on the blockchain nodes is written in solidity language and traditionally called as \u201csmart contracts\u201d.Architecture of our Ethereum Dapp:Client\u2019s Browser: It is just like a normal browser of any web application written in html, css and javascript.Web3.js: Web3.js is a collection of libraries that enables your browser to interact with blockchain. It enables you to read and write data from smart contracts, transfer ethers between accounts and much more.Web3 Provider: Ethereum network contains nodes and all nodes share the same copy of data. Setting a \u201cweb3 provider\u201d in web3.js tells our code that which node we are going to read and write data from. We are using Metamask in our implementation that injects its web3 provider in the browser. Metamask is a browser extension for Chrome and Firefox that lets users securely manage their Ethereum accounts and private keys, and use these accounts to interact with websites that are using Web3.js.Ethereum Virtual Machine: Every ethereum node in ethereum network runs their own EVM implementation and responsible for running the same instructions of smart contracts over the ethereum network.Ok that\u2019s all about the theory, to wake you up let\u2019s start with the development.What we are going to develop?We are going to develop a simple decentralized newsfeed system. News publisher can post news on blockchain with their account addresses. These news will be immutable and displayed in the same order as they are posted.Our Final Dapp will look something like this:You can refer to the code at GitHub anytime you face issues. But I urge you to code each step yourself along with me.Step 1: Setting up the StructureI presume that you have set the development environment already. In command prompt create a new directory and unbox \u201ctruffle-box\u201d in that respective directory to get the structure of project.mkdir postnewscd postnewstruffle unbox pet-shopThis will set up the following basic structure in your folder:Let\u2019s examine the project structure Truffle Box gave us.Contracts: As obvious with the name, here all our smart contracts will reside.Migrations: Includes Migration files to migrate smart contracts to blockchain.Node_modules: Contains all node dependenciesSrc: Home for all client side application codeTest: Where we write tests for our smart contract either in solidity or javascript. We are not going to write any tests in our implementation because we are building a basic implementation of Dapp. But tests are important to write when you are working on commercial projects, because each migration of smart contract on blockchain causes gas cost. Thus, you want to make sure that your smart contracts are bug free and perform the intended functionality.Step 2: Writing Smart ContractCreate a new file news.sol in contract folder and write the following code in it.pragma solidity >=0.4.0 <=0.6.0;contract news{struct newsfeed{address publisher;string newsdesc;}mapping(uint => newsfeed) public newsfeeds;uint public newsCount;function addnews(string memory newsdesc) public {newsCount++;newsfeeds[newsCount].publisher = msg.sender;newsfeeds[newsCount].newsdesc = newsdesc;}}Let me explain this code. First we specify that the current code is runnable on the solidity compiler version greater than 0.4.0 and smaller than 0.6.0 with \u201cpragma solidity\u201d. Then we initialized the contract and initialized the structure of our newsfeed containing address of publisher (initialized with address data type) and news itself (initialized with string data type).To store this created structure we have created mapping that is just like a key value pair. The key to mapping is an unsigned integer and the value is the \u201cnewsfeed struct\u201d.\u201cnewscount\u201d keeps track of the number of posted news and initially 0. Addnews function will store publisher address and news in the struct referenced by the key value. \u201cmsg.sender\u201d gets the address of account which has called the contract.Simple. Isn\u2019t it? Now let\u2019s compile this smart contract to see if it runs properly. To do this, navigate to your project folder in console and writetruffle compileNow lets migrate our current smart contract on Ganache. To do this, create a new file in Migration folder named \u201c2_deploy_contracts.js\u201d. Paste the following code in that file to migrate your contract:var news = artifacts.require(\u201c./news.sol\u201d);module.exports = function(deployer) {deployer.deploy(news);};Save it and in console type:truffle migrateMake sure that Ganache is open and running while you migrate your contract. And hurrah! Your contract is successfully migrated to Ganache.Step 3: Developing Client-side application to interact with contractGo to your index.html file and paste the following code:<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\u201den\u201d><head><meta charset=\u201dutf-8\"><meta http-equiv=\u201dX-UA-Compatible\u201d content=\u201dIE=edge\u201d><meta name=\u201dviewport\u201d content=\u201dwidth=device-width, initial-scale=1\"><! \u2014 The above 3 meta tags *must* come first in the head; any other head content must come *after* these tags \u2192<title>Decentralized Newsfeed</title><! \u2014 Bootstrap \u2192<link href=\u201dcss/bootstrap.min.css\u201d rel=\u201dstylesheet\u201d><! \u2014 HTML5 shim and Respond.js for IE8 support of HTML5 elements and media queries \u2192<! \u2014 WARNING: Respond.js doesn\u2019t work if you view the page via file:// \u2192<! \u2014 [if lt IE 9]><script src=\u201dhttps://oss.maxcdn.com/html5shiv/3.7.3/html5shiv.min.js\"></script><script src=\u201dhttps://oss.maxcdn.com/respond/1.4.2/respond.min.js\"></script><![endif] \u2192</head><body><div class=\u201dcontainer\u201d><div class=\u201drow\u201d><div class=\u201dcol-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-sm-push-2\"><h1 class=\u201dtext-center\u201d>Decentralized Newsfeed</h1><hr/><br/></div></div><div id=\u201dnewsRow\u201d class=\u201drow\u201d><! \u2014 NEWS LOAD HERE \u2192</div><! \u2014 <button class=\u201dbtn btn-default\u201d type=\u201dbutton\u201d class=\u201daaaaaddProd\u201d>Add Product</button> \u2192<! \u2014 Button trigger modal \u2192<button type=\u201dbutton\u201d style=\u201dalign:center;\u201d class=\u201dbtn btn-primary\u201d data-toggle=\u201dmodal\u201d data-target=\u201d#exampleModalCenter\u201d>Add News</button></div><! \u2014 Modal \u2192<div class=\u201dmodal fade\u201d id=\u201dexampleModalCenter\u201d tabindex=\u201d-1\" role=\u201ddialog\u201d aria-labelledby=\u201dexampleModalCenterTitle\u201d aria-hidden=\u201dtrue\u201d><div class=\u201dmodal-dialog modal-dialog-centered\u201d role=\u201ddocument\u201d><! \u2014 Modal Content \u2192<div class=\u201dmodal-content\u201d><! \u2014 Modal Header \u2192<div class=\u201dmodal-header\u201d><h5 class=\u201dmodal-title\u201d id=\u201dexampleModalCenterTitle\u201d>Add News</h5><button type=\u201dbutton\u201d class=\u201dclose\u201d data-dismiss=\u201dmodal\u201d aria-label=\u201dClose\u201d><span aria-hidden=\u201dtrue\u201d>&times;</span></button></div><! \u2014 Modal Body \u2192<div class=\u201dmodal-body\u201d><form><div class=\u201dform-group\u201d><textarea class=\u201dform-control postbox\u201d id=\u201dpost\u201d placeholder=\u201dAdd you story Here\u2026\u201d rows=\u201d5\"></textarea></div><button type=\u201dsubmit\u201d data-dismiss=\u201dmodal\u201d class=\u201dbtn btn-primary addNews\u201d>Post News</button></form></div><div class=\u201dmodal-footer\u201d><button type=\u201dbutton\u201d class=\u201dbtn btn-secondary\u201d data-dismiss=\u201dmodal\u201d>Close</button></div></div></div></div><div id=\u201dpostTemplate\u201d style=\u201ddisplay: none;\u201d><div class=\u201dcol-md-12\"><div class=\u201dpanel panel-default panel-pet\u201d><div class=\u201dpanel-heading\u201d><strong>Publisher Address</strong> <h3 class=\u201dpanel-title\u201d> Account Address </h3></div><div class=\u201dpanel-body\u201d><strong>Descrition</strong>: <span class=\u201ddesc\u201d> </span><br/></div></div></div></div><! \u2014 jQuery (necessary for Bootstrap\u2019s JavaScript plugins) \u2192<script src=\u201dhttps://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.12.4/jquery.min.js\"></script><! \u2014 Include all compiled plugins (below), or include individual files as needed \u2192<script src=\u201djs/bootstrap.min.js\u201d></script><script src=\u201djs/web3.min.js\u201d></script><script src=\u201djs/truffle-contract.js\u201d></script><script src=\u201djs/app.js\u201d></script></body></html>Ok!

Add News Button is navigating to the model that opens a dialogue for adding news. \u201cposttemplate\u201d contains the layout of how your posts will be displayed on screen.To make this code in action lets write some code in app.js and see how it is going to link up with our smart contract.In your app.js file first add the following code to setup the web3 provider for web3.js in browser.App = {web3Provider: null,contracts: {},initWeb3: async function() {// Modern dapp browsers\u2026if (window.ethereum) {App.web3Provider = window.ethereum;try {// Request account accessawait window.ethereum.enable();} catch (error) {// User denied account access\u2026console.error(\u201cUser denied account access\u201d)}}// Legacy dapp browsers\u2026else if (window.web3) {App.web3Provider = window.web3.currentProvider;}// If no injected web3 instance is detected, fall back to Ganacheelse {App.web3Provider = new Web3.providers.HttpProvider(\u2018http://localhost:7545');}// App.web3Provider = new Web3.providers.HttpProvider(\u2018http://localhost:8545');web3 = new Web3(App.web3Provider);return App.initContract();},Extend app.js with the following code:initContract: function() {$.getJSON(\u2018news.json\u2019, function(data) {// Get the necessary contract artifact file and instantiate it with truffle-contractApp.contracts.news = TruffleContract(data);// Set the provider for our contractApp.contracts.news.setProvider(App.web3Provider);return App.init();});return App.AddNewsButton();},When we compile our contract \u201cnews.json\u201d is created in build folder. Truffle has a library called \u201cTruffleContract\u201d that keeps information about the contract. So using this library we set web3 provider for our contract. This enables our client side application to interact with our smart contract deployed on blockchain.Move forward and add the following code in app.js:AddNewsButton: function() {$(document).on(\u2018click\u2019, \u2018.addNews\u2019, App.AddNews);},AddNews:function(event){var post = document.getElementById(\u2018post\u2019).valuevar postInstance;App.contracts.news.deployed().then(function(instance){postInstance = instance;return postInstance.addnews(post);});console.log(\u201cNews posted\u201d);},};This code will take the user entered news and pass it to our add news function in smart contract. Smart contract will write the publisher address and news on blockchain using mapping.Finally add the following code in app.js to render the html template with data on every page reload so your news will be displayed.init: async function() {// Load Newsvar postInstance;App.contracts.news.deployed().then(function(instance){postInstance = instance;return postInstance.newsCount();}).then(function(result){var counts = result.c[0];console.log(\u201cTotal News : \u201c+counts);for (var i = 1; i <= counts; i ++) {postInstance.newsfeeds(i).then(function(result){console.log(\u201cPublisher Address:\u201d +result[0]);console.log(\u201cNews:\u201d +result[1]);var newsRow = $(\u2018#newsRow\u2019);var postTemplate = $(\u2018#postTemplate\u2019);postTemplate.find(\u2018.panel-title\u2019).text(result[0]);postTemplate.find(\u2018.desc\u2019).text(result[1]);newsRow.append(postTemplate.html());});}});\u2018i\u2019 initialized with 1 is passed as a key to newsfeeds mapping. This will fetch the structure details on index i. Structure details are just like an array having \u201cpublisher address\u201d at 0 index and \u201cnewsdesc\u201d at 1 index. This data will be retrieved from smart contract and append to \u201cpostTemplate\u201d in index.html.Now in your console type \u201cnpm run dev\u201d to run your dapp.This will open up the dapp in your browser. Make sure you are logged in with metamask and its running on port 7545.Kudos!

Not as precious as a white Alba truffle, but still delicious! Image my own.Lila, the lean hound, zigzagged across our path in the misty hazelnut grove, her nose to the ground. Suddenly, as if she\u2019d heard her name called, she dashed to the foot of a nearby tree and began digging, paws blurring and earth flying through the air.\u201cLila! Dai!\u201d Her handler dragged her back, stroking and praising her, while we hurried to kneel at Lila\u2019s paws. He handed us our tools: a short spade and a vanghetto \u2014 a kind of slender miniature axe, with one blunt end and one pronged.\u201cBe very gentle,\u201d he warned. Carefully, we went to work. Lila had already revealed the outlines of what we sought: an earth-colored knob small enough to be cradled in the palm of your hand. We detached it from the soil \u2014 brushing as much earth off the sides as we could, seeding the find for next year\u2019s harvest \u2014 and held it up to our noses, greedily inhaling the heady aroma. We had found one: a precious white Alba truffle.Alba, a town in Piedmont, northern Italy, is known for its hazelnuts (the majority of the harvest from the grove we were hunting in would be sold to Nutella), its delicious nebbiolo wines (the best known examples are the Barolo and Barbaresco), and most famously, its fabulously aromatic and potent white truffles. White Alba truffles are among the most valuable in the world \u2014 they have been priced up to $10,000 per pound. We had come from London to spend a weekend at the International Truffle Festival, which runs in Alba for 6 weeks in October and November every year.I expected to enjoy some terrific food while we were in Alba that weekend. And we did \u2014 crispy fried eggs topped with shaved truffle, fresh buttered spaghetti with truffle, even silky vanilla gelato piled with translucent curls of delicate truffle. It was even more fabulous than I had imagined. The whole town was pervaded by that joyous, contented buzz that one feels after pushing back from the table and loosening the top button of your jeans after a really fantastic meal.Because another reason truffles are so precious is that they don\u2019t have a long shelf life. Once they are taken from the ground, they are best eaten right away \u2014 or three to five days later, at the most. There we were, in the center of a culinary capital, surrounded by rare, delicious food that we were obliged to eat right away. I\u2019m happy to report that everyone rose to the occasion. There was something wonderful about seeing a whole town tuck in to such precious delicacies without a smidgen of guilt. (Not that Italians ever evince much guilt around enjoying themselves, especially when it comes to food. I should know \u2014 I\u2019m married to an Italian.)The thing was, it didn\u2019t feel like self-indulgence, this massive truffle-fest. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it was indulgent to fly to Alba for a weekend of eating wonderful food, but I wouldn\u2019t say it was self-indulgent. Does that feel like I\u2019m splitting hairs? Self-indulgence is, to me, mindlessly eating an entire bag of salt and vinegar crisps on the couch, is binge-watching the latest Netflix series in a single weekend, is the flat, empty, alcoholic buzz on a Monday night, is blankly watching pornography in the dark. What I experienced in Alba that weekend, on the other hand, felt like something entirely different. It didn\u2019t feel like we were being self-indulgent at all. It felt like we were receiving.Receiving is not self-indulgent. Receiving is whole-heartedly accepting the good, the beautiful, the joyous aspects and moments of our lives. Where self-indulgence is oddly passive, receiving is active. Where self-indulgence is absent, receiving is present. In fact, we absolutely must be fully present, fully in the moment, to receive at all, because it is necessarily a fleeting experience. It is therefore vulnerable and very raw and somehow pure. It\u2019s joyful. Even if it\u2019s only eating a plate of simple spaghetti, and relishing every perfect al dente bite.We are inclined, I think, to think of joy like a fine wine \u2014 something to be kept out of direct sunlight, in a climate-controlled space where it won\u2019t get jostled, to be taken out reverently and enjoyed only \u201con a special occasion.\u201d Why is this? Could it be that we are afraid of joy? There is a kind of peculiar paranoia here \u2014 as if we think that the second we let joy in, someone or something will snatch it away. Or as if we\u2019re only allotted a small modicum of joy each, to be carefully rationed out over the course of a lifetime. Of course, taking a step back, this is blatantly illogical: the only person we deprive by rejecting joy \u2014 in whatever form it appears to us \u2014 is ourselves.Since our weekend trip to Alba, I\u2019m inclined to think of joy less like a fine wine and more like a truffle. When I scent it across my path, I intend to race to get my hands dirty digging it up, and then I intend to devour it \u2014 infuse my morning eggs with it, and my lunchtime pasta, and my evening ice cream. I intend to gorge myself on joy, when I find it, wherever I find it. Because I know that those moments will sustain me through the dark months when the Alba truffle is out of season, slowly re-growing in the damp, warm womb of the hazelnut groves.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Food", "Travel", "Life Lessons"]}, {"title": "Truffle Hunt Club", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@HeyTruffle/truffle-hunt-club-5c990797764e?source=search_post", "author_name": "Truffle", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@HeyTruffle", "publish_date": "2017-06-14", "last_modified_date": "2018-01-26", "readtime": "1.92", "claps": 4, "voters": 4, "content": "Truffle Hunt ClubTruffleFollowJun 14, 2017 \u00b7 2 min readWe hosted our first Truffle Hunt Club event on Wednesday June 7th at Sunday in Brooklyn.

Although probably no contracts have been exposed to it, the Solidity team urges everyone to move to 0.5.6 asap. In addition, there are further advancements in the SMTChecker and AbiEncoder v2.For the contents of the previous release check the previous episode here:Solidity 0.5.5, Opera to add iOS wallets and libraries updatesBlockchain Dev Weekly Digest 11.03.19medium.comTruffle 5.0.8 ReleasedResource: https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/releases/tag/v5.0.8Truffle has released a new version of their framework \u2014 5.0.8.

TxFlow allows you to trace the flow of a transaction inside and outside of contracts.By simply inputing your transaction hash of the transaction you want to trace, you are able to see the stack of executions in an aesthetic, visual way. I do hope we are going to see more of this tool in the next months.As far as I\u2019ve seen, it might require a certain modification of the geth node, but hopefully this can be made to work with a regular released geth and parity.Nodesmith Ethereum betaResource: https://medium.com/nodesmith-blog/announcing-the-nodesmith-ethereum-beta-eab286d5075dOn the matter of nodes, a new player has emerged at the infrastructure as a service scene to compete with Infura.The company is called Nodesmith and they have released their beta version of their tool, with support for Ethereum (except Mainnet, though).Nodesmith, as expected, support and handle Ethereum JSON RPC calls like any node. In addition, they have an exciting feature of event caching \u2014 feature that I\u2019ve seen multiple projects being forced to implement themselves. Another exciting claim is that their architecture is supposed to be cloud provider agnostic, with tons of engineering put behind to make it true.Exciting things that they\u2019ve planned ahead are:IPFS node as a serviceWebhooks APIHosted side-chains and bridgesTutorials & ArticlesTrustless, Noncustodial Exchange PrototypeResource: https://blog.enuma.io/update/2019/03/08/trustless-noncustodial-exchange.htmlLast but not least, a new exciting read by enuma.io has been published. The topic at hand is an overview of how one can create trustless non-custodial exchanges.The gist of it is creating a plasma-like layer 2 solution. The operator serves and maintains the balances of the users while committing to a Merkle Tree root of the balances they maintain. The clients are required to log in at least once a day in order to verify and dispute if needed.Such an architecture provides both security and performance to the system. The tradeoff comes in the liveness requirement for the users of this system.Follow us on:https://twitter.com/GSpasovhttps://twitter.com/LimeChainHQhttps://twitter.com/etherlimehttps://limechain.tech/Sources:Latest Week in EthereumThe latest Week in Ethereum News is: https://weekinethereumnews.com/february-8-2019/www.weekinethereum.comr/ethdevr/ethdev: Ethereum-related dev talk: Contracts, DApps, Wallets, Clients, Infrastructure, Tooling, UIs, Patterns, and\u2026www.reddit.comThanks to all the people that have messaged me about the news this week!About the author: George Spasov, Co-founder and Blockchain Architect @LimeChain, has developed a multitude of blockchain projects \u2014 public and private \u2014 and is a prominent member of several blockchains communities.

In case when they have a complex business logic it becomes much harder.Recently I needed to test a smart contract for thousands of participants and check how much gas the contract needs for its methods. It was necessary to prove robustness of business logic and predictability of costs. I spent a few days on testing and I found a pretty fast way for heavy load testing in local blockchain net.PrerequisitesI assume that you know the basics about smart contracts, Ethereum, Truffle framework and Ganache (ex. TestRPC).Versions:Truffle 4.0.3Ganache-cli v6.1.0-beta.0 (see this release notes) I had to use this beta version, because the latest stable release 6.0.3 had permanent issue with \u201cgasPrice of undefined\u201dweb3js 0.20.2Be aware that web3js 1.0 has completely different API than version 0.20.x and this article may be obsolete in a month or so. Gears are spinning, chains are moving.Demo projectThere is the demo project for this article: https://github.com/Kipriz/truffle-heavy-loadIt contains a simple smart contract, a kind of dummy lottery, and the tests for it that can operate with thousands of transactions and participants.Automining approach: limited number of txsInitially, I tried the most straigthforward and dummy way: run ganache-cli with automining and execute transactions one by one. See this test for reference.This approach was pretty fast, about 500 txs in 50 seconds. If a test waits for events, it took much longer, about 1 tx/s.However, when I tried 5000 txs, truffle was not able to wait or understand what happens and it fails: Error: Could not connect to your Ethereum client. Please check that your Ethereum clientI was wondering a way to test at least 15K txs and automining did not work. I tried to combine transaction in blocks per 100 and add delays between the blocks. It worked, but was unstable and slow. I needed to set delay with a margin to be sure than 100 txs had been proceeded. Then I tried to disable automining and set fixed block time\u2026Fixed blocktime and events: unlimited number of txs if you have enough patienceFirstly, I discovered than I can specify block time and disable automining. I run ganache-cli in the following way:> ganache-cli -m \"candy maple cake sugar pudding cream honey rich smooth crumble sweet treat\" -u 0 -u 1 --gasLimit 0x2FEFD800000 -a 100 --defaultBalanceEther 10000 --blocktime 5 > ganache.logA few useful comments:--blocktime 5 \u2014 set block time to 5 seconds.-a 100 \u2014 number of accounts to create. Ganache UI allows up to 100 accounts, CLI is able to operate with 10K.--defaultBalanceEther 10000 \u2014 feel free to allocate as much ether to accounts as you need. It is just free in your local test net--gasLimit 0x2FEFD800000 \u2014 use it to avoid permanent \u2018out of gas\u2019 exceptions. However, be careful with gas usage.Initially, I tried to submit a bunch of transaction, wait 10 to 15 seconds and than submit another bunch. It worked but not better than automining and again I needed to wait some extra time.Secondly, I found that I can subscribe to \u2018block mined\u2019 event and not wait extra time. Ethereum allows to subscribe for 2 events: pending and latest. The names are slightly cryptic, but pending event occurs when there is at least 1 pending transaction for next block. The latest event is fired after mining of a block.Subscribe for latest event to do something after a block is mined. For example, send next bunch of transactions.See this test for all details: https://github.com/Kipriz/truffle-heavy-load/blob/master/test/Test_03_buy_500_tickets_using_events.es6This test can be run with 5K txs or even 15K. I\u2019m sure than it can bear even more, but I did not have enough patience.Now, you can test thousands of transactions for your smart contract as fast as I know.", "responses": 1, "tags": ["Smart Contracts", "Truffle", "Testing"]}, {"title": "Behind the scenes of that favourite \u201ctruffle beef bowl\u201d \u2014 a UX case study", "post_link": "https://uxdesign.cc/behind-the-scenes-of-that-favourite-truffle-beef-bowl-a-ux-case-study-67f82c492694?source=search_post", "author_name": "Michelle Bridget", "author_link": "https://uxdesign.cc/@michellebridgetlim", "publish_date": "2018-09-21", "last_modified_date": "2018-09-22", "readtime": "8.07", "claps": 128, "voters": 4, "content": "Behind the scenes of that favourite \u201ctruffle beef bowl\u201d \u2014 a UX case studyFoodRazor\u2019s Website Redesigned.Michelle BridgetFollowSep 21, 2018 \u00b7 9 min readWhat goes beyond the secret recipe of your favourite dish? Rarely does the process of ordering supplies or handling invoices, or even choosing the better supplier comes to mind. Do we ever wonder what procedures the business goes through before that sizzling beef bowl reaches the table? I definitely didn\u2019t.At least, not until now.Disclaimer: This is a pro bono collaboration with FoodRazor for our final project at UXDI General Assembly, Singapore.The ask was to redesign the layout of FoodRazor\u2019s website based on user research and translate actionable insights into workable solutions for their new site.As this was our first back-stage pass to the F&B industry, we were eager to explore every corner and turn every stone for this 3-week sprint!Phase One: Understanding the BusinessWhat/Who is FoodRazor?FoodRazor is a food procurement software for restaurants to manage their orders and supplies, extract data from invoices and review personalised analytics to grow their business.Their goal for the website is for it to act as a spokesperson for the business, and have sufficient information to attend to any burning enquiries from potential customers. When you trim relayed communication, it speeds up the decision making process, in the hopes to increase the number of sign ups.We kickstarted the project with a heuristic evaluation to identify usability issues with the user interface (UI) design of the site.What was done well?The overall design of the website was clean and simple. The use of white space created a visual hierarchy and it directed the focus on the content.The \u201csticky\u201d navigation bar allows ease of access to the website\u2019s core functionalities.The current websiteWhat needed improvement?Consecutive automated carousel sliders were too distracting and confusing.Language used on the website was too technical.Overloading of information resulted in heavy cognitive load for the user.Competitor Research AnalysisWe also conducted competitive analysis to see how competitors, ZeeMart (local) and MarketMan (international), have fared with their website and how FoodRazor could learn from them. The analysis was done with the LEMErS framework, where 5 is the highest score.GIF \u2014 Competitive analysis assessing the site based on 5 criteria (LEMErS framework)Phase Two: Understanding the UsersTo see things from the flip side, we ran interviews with key project stakeholders, potential customers and existing users.Stakeholder InterviewsThe goal of interviewing the Sales and Customer Success teams was to help inform our understanding of their existing customer base, outreach processes and on-boarding sessions with potential customers.Key FindingsCustomers are driven by value.Customers are concerned with how to use the software, how will it benefit them and how it will integrate with their business.Affinity Map for Stakeholder InterviewsUser InterviewsThe scope was focused on customer usage profiling to understand the current technologies and processes that restaurant/cafe owners and chefs have adopted.Key FindingsUsers are hesitant to use new technology because of the learning curve.They have developed their own methods of doing the accounting as well as keeping track of orders.They communicate with their suppliers via WhatsApp or calls. Some have been working with the same supplier for many years.Those who have been in the industry for a long time are very comfortable with their current communication methods with suppliers.Affinity Map for User InterviewsHow did the current website fared for the users?We led usability tests with the interviewees to see what they took away from browsing the website for the first time.The display of clientele is a good selling point as it builds confidence.Case studies are not necessarily important to the users as they don\u2019t have time to read.Homepage failed to convey who and what FoodRazor is, at a glance.Persona & Customer Journey Map (CJM)With all the research data and insights collected, we created 3 personas to represent the different types of users that might use FoodRazor.The CJMs were designed to highlight key interactions that the personas have with the product through storytelling. It conveys user goals, emotions, pain points and opportunities in which FoodRazor can tap in to bridge the gaps.First Persona: Max, 28, Business-Chef OwnerMax is open to using new technology in his work processes for greater efficiency but is concerned that his older staff might not be able to adapt to the change. He needs a way for his staff to see the value and benefits of new technology in order to convince them get on board with it.Max\u2019s Customer Journey MapSecond Persona: Jolene, 54, Business OwnerJolene does not rely heavily on technology to run her business. She only uses Excel to track her accountings. Due to her low tech proficiency, Jolene is resistant to advanced technology. She needs to know that the new software will be as easy and simple to use as the current ones she is using.Jolene\u2019s Customer Journey MapThird Persona: Kenny, 41, Head ChefAs the sole decision maker in the kitchen, Kenny has to ensure that logistics are handled well and supplies are always in stock to anticipate demand and prevent cancellation of menu. He needs to know what his options are when he troubleshoots.Kenny\u2019s Customer Journey MapPhase Three: Prototyping and ValidatingBridging the gaps with Content StrategyA content strategy map was used to identify content gaps in the user\u2019s journey when they interact with the website. This helped us to focus on developing content based on the persona\u2019s intent.Our solution will bridge the following content gaps \u2013Highlight what matters the most: Users care about making informed decisions but are unable to because information are either hidden, insufficient or unavailable.Spell out the benefits in detail: Users are already comfortable with their current work processes. So what are we going to say to earn their buy-in? How will FoodRazor help their business make more money?Give assurance: Users are hesitant because of the learning curve. So we need to build confidence. Assure them that the learning process is straightforward and that help will always be readily available.Validating the PrototypesMeasuring Task UsabilityThe Single Ease Question (SEQ) is a 7-point rating scale to assess how difficult users find a task (7 being \u201cVery Easy\u201d). This test provided us with insights at every round, as we were able to ask for their reasons behind each score, in order to keep reiterating our prototype. The average scores of 6 tests made up the final scores.SEQ Test ResultsEven though the SEQ test showed good results (which means we have all the pieces we need), something was still not right.Designing with a StoryWith our first few prototypes, we were struggling to figure out the best way to manage both user needs and business goals. The prototypes were either too focused on the users or targetted at the business.And then it hit me.UX is all about telling a story \u2014 through user research, ideation and even usability testing. Because stories create impact.With story-telling, the website will be able to connect with users at a deeper level while fulfilling its goal as a spokesperson for the business. It can also address the users\u2019 needs and pain points, and illustrate how they might achieve their goals with FoodRazor.The new layout will be designed to take them on a journey where they face their fears, slay ferocious dragons and save the day with a magical sword. Somewhat.And there we have it \u2014 our design solutions for FoodRazor\u2019s website revamp. With these, we hope that we\u2019ve met the needs of the users and helped to bring the business a step closer to its goals. Here\u2019s to a successful launch!Disclaimer: As this is just a mid-fi prototype, the copies may be subjected to change at the discretion of FoodRazor. All illustrations used are for visualisation purposes only.Illustration credit: Cami Dobrin and MitasAfter ThoughtsAs my first client project came to a close, I realised I\u2019ve learnt so much about the people I designed for and the people I designed with. So here are some takeaways that struck a chord.The sweet spotFinding the right balance between business goals and user needs is something you will have to figure out for every project. And it becomes exceptionally important when it involves real world clients. Their goals and problems become as real as your user\u2019s and you want to ensure that you satisfy both ends.So you start to ask yourself questions like \u201cIf I do this, its good for the user but is it good for the business too? What value does it bring?\u201d. I guess the only way to know is to keep collaborating with them and get their two cents\u2019 worth so they have a say in the final product too.There will always be two sides to a coinAs UX designers, I feel like our main purpose here on earth is to empathise. Empathising with your users, your clients, your teams; and the list just keeps growing. And with that empathy, we go a step further and do something meaningful with it.I became a designer because it\u2019s not enough for me to theoretically make the world a better place. I needed to know how to do it and do it right, and it seems that having empathy is a good place to start.Someone once shared this and it stuck with me for a long time. Hopefully it will stick with you too.In social issues class today our professor held up a black book and he said \u201cthis book is red\u201d. We were all \u201cno\u201d and he said \u201cyes it is\u201d and we were just all \u201cthat\u2019s not right\u201d. Then he turned it around and the back cover was red and he said \u201cdon\u2019t tell somebody they\u2019re wrong until you\u2019ve seen things from their point of view.\u201dSpecial thanks to FoodRazor for entrusting us with this opportunity. I hope our design solutions have left some sort of impact and supported your research team in some way. Looking forward to your official website revamp!Three cheers for my teammates Joyce and Charlene for conquering this sprint with me!

The lactic acid felt like fire in my legs and my lungs were struggling to find air \u2014 I was starting to feel like I couldn\u2019t run any longer. Leave it to me to be perpetually late to everything. Even an expensive Airbnb truffle hunting experience in Italy that I had on my bucket list for years.\u201cAlmost there!\u201d my friend Jeremy encouraged me as we spotted the finish line: Roma Tuscolana station. Out of breath, Jeremy dashed to the ticket machine while I frantically scanned the departures board for the correct platform of the train headed to Bracciano. \u201cWHERE ARE WE GOING AGAIN?\u201d Jeremy yelled out.Platform 4, got it. I ran over to the ticket machine and I jabbed the button for Bracciano. My heart was pounding \u2014 one minute left! What felt like a century later, the machine spit out our tickets and we were sprinting, again, to the platform. Praise the Italian truffle gods!! The train had not left. I wondered what these Italian commuters must\u2019ve been thinking of these two heavily-breathing, disheveled Americans that just hopped on their train. We took our seats and let out a huge sigh of relief. This train would get us to Bracciano at exactly 9AM, the meeting time of our expedition with Matteo (our truffle aficionado of the day). If the train had left without us, the next one would\u2019ve been 45 minutes later, making us miss the experience of a lifetime. I looked at our tickets and let out a laugh. 3 euros for an hour and 15-minute train ride! My god, I love this country!Since we had a late night yesterday (which explains the running), we thought the train ride would be the perfect time to catch up on sleep. But alas, the seats were too upright, and we could barely sleep without our heads nodding. Still sleepy, we finally arrived at Bracciano, a small lakeside town 30 kilometers northwest of Rome. Matteo had messaged me saying that he would be 5 minutes late to pick us up, so Jeremy and I thought it would be a good idea to grab a snack since we hadn\u2019t eaten anything that morning. We walked into the nearest caf\u00e9 and found that it was completely empty and had tacky purple wallpaper and furniture. We tried asking the owner for some croissants in our horrible Italian and with a whole lot of pointing. He put them on plates and said it would be 2 euros. Shoot. We didn\u2019t have any cash and he did not take card. Well this is awkward. Again, in botched Italian, we asked where the nearest ATM was and said that we would come back. Using ambiguous hand gestures, he said \u201caround the corner, a left, a right, then straight for a while, then another left.\u201dAt this point the 5 minutes had already passed, and Matteo was waiting for us at the station. Jeremy and I attempted to find this ATM with no luck. We even walked into another caf\u00e9 and was told \u201cno card, only cash.\u201d We stubbornly accepted defeat and headed back to the station. On the way, the purple-caf\u00e9 owner was standing outside awaiting our money and we awkwardly said that we did not find the ATM and shrugged our shoulders. What a start. Worn out, hungry, and awkward. But we wouldn\u2019t let this ruin our day.We introduced ourselves to Matteo, a cheerful young man who had grown up in Bracciano and makes a living hosting truffle hunting tours and selling truffles to restaurants and stores. Joining us on this trip were 2 middle-aged American journalists from Brooklyn. We all climbed into Matteo\u2019s FIAT and were driven to a forest in Monterano Natural Reserve. Immediately, my nose crinkled in disgust. What is that awful smell? I looked behind me to find three adorable dogs (one black spaniel named Wendy and two Lagotto Romagnolos, an all-white one named Giulietta and a brown and white one named Uzi) panting in the trunk. The wet dog smell instantly made me car sick, so I attempted not to breathe for the whole fifteen-minute ride. As the roads got narrower, curvier, and rougher, I kept bumping legs with the woman next to me.At last, we made it. Matteo opened the trunk letting the dogs out, and they excitedly starting sniffing everybody and everything. Before we set out into the woods, Matteo explained the biology of truffles, their symbiosis with the trees in the forest, and their importance to Italian cuisine. In short, they put that stuff on everything.The truffle dogs (from left to right): Giulietta, Uzi, and Wendy.Matteo explaining the biology of truffles with Wendy in his arm.Giulietta smiling for the camera.We followed the dogs into the woods, watching with anticipation as they found the scent of truffles underneath the ground and starting digging. Matteo would run over, slide the dog out of the way, and use a knife and shovel to unearth the truffles. He would pass them around for everyone to smell. It smelled like a thousand dollars of culinary gold. Every time a dog found a truffle, Matteo would give them a treat and vigorously pet them in celebration. Giulietta would accidentally get too excited and bite down into truffles she found, Wendy was in training and would get easily distracted, and Uzi was in retirement and was just along for the ride. Every so often we would hear, \u201cGiulietta, no! Uzi, dove sei? Wendy, qua!\u201d It was an amusing chaos.Matteo digging through the soil for truffles.Giulietta proud of her latest find.I quickly fell in love with the Italian countryside. I had never seen so many beautiful wildflowers in one place. We picked some magenta sweet pea flowers and tucked them behind our ears. The views of Lake Bracciano and the rolling hills seemed alive with color and sound. There were even horses in the woods, making everything all the more majestic.Lake BraccianoMatteo hiking through the forest with horses hidden behind the trees.Sweet pea flowers tucked behind Jeremy\u2019s ear.The diverse flora of the Italian countryside.\u201cNo!! Uzi!\u201d Matteo jumped over a fence into the horse\u2019s pen to retrieve Uzi who had rolled around in horse manure. Matteo dunked her repeatedly in the horse\u2019s drinking water and let her go. We asked what happened and he replied, \u201cShe put her body into da poop-ah!\u201d Deprived of food and sleep, me and Jeremy burst out laughing and couldn\u2019t stop.After about two hours, Matteo\u2019s pockets were full of truffles. He announced that it was time to go to his friend\u2019s house in town for a homemade lunch con i tartufi. Finally! My stomach had been quivering with hunger pangs.We feasted on plate after plate of truffle-garnished pastas, cheeses, bread, eggs, and chickpeas with homemade wine and olive oil until we couldn\u2019t stomach it anymore. Conversation was lovely for the first hour but then things began to drag on. Italians and Americans have very different attitudes towards awkward silences. Whenever we ran out of things to talk about, Matteo and his friend would smile and stare at us calmly. Us Americans fidgeted in our seats in discomfort and tried wrapping things up five separate times, \u201cWell that was amazing . . . Matteo you are an excellent cook . . . I\u2019m wiped out . . .\u201d To this, Matteo thanked us and kept sitting. Eventually after another hour of uncomfortable off-and-on silence, we were back on the move.Homemade mozzarella with grated truffles.Matteo dropped us off at the train station, and we waved goodbye to our hospitable Italian host. \u201cWant to go swimming?\u201d I asked Jeremy. \u201cYeah, why not!\u201d We walked down to the lake and splashed into the frigid water. Since Lake Bracciano used to be a volcano, the sand was black and extremely entertaining to play with. Floating in the water, I took a deep breath and tried to absorb the moment \u2014 I am swimming in Italy with my best friend! We smuggled some dinosaur bone-looking rocks and headed back to our Airbnb in Rome.A quick swim in Lake Bracciano at the end of a memorable day.While adventures off the beaten track are full of unexpected mishaps and awkward interactions, it is this imperfection that makes them so memorable. They are, without a doubt, experiences of a lifetime. And to think we almost missed our train.About the Writer:Stephanie is from Weehawken, New Jersey and her favorite city is Copenhagen.

That is the question\u2026 or how to seamlessly deploy to ethereum mainnetNicolas CloutierFollowNov 1, 2017 \u00b7 3 min readAfter 4 days of deployment nightmare of our new contract with Rob our CTO at Kryptopy Inc, I decided to share our experience with the new Byzantium upgrade of Ethereum, Truffle, Geth, and so on.We wish to share our tips with other blockchain / ethereum developer here to avoid them to relive the same nightmare as we did.First of all, Truffle is a good environment, we like it\u2026 for testing. If you want to deploy to mainnet, we definitely not recommend it.The reason is that you will get tons of errors related to the fact that Truffle cannot cope with all the changes and for a reason. There are just too much. So rule #1 use truffle to test your contracts, version them, make sure they work the way they are intended to. But do not use it to deploy.Took us days to understand it. Maybe with the new upgrade that was released today this has changed, however we still wouldn\u2019t use it for that purpose.So first step for a successful contract deployment to Ethereum as of today (October 31st 2017) = Upgrade everything. Old versions simply won\u2019t work with the Byzantium upgrade. This means : geth, parity, and whatever else you are using on a daily basis for your smart contracts. For geth, use version 1.7.2 as a minimum.If you are patient and want to syncronize with geth and do all your deployment from there the old school way, make sure you have plenty of memory and I mean plenty! Less than 16GB of ram and without a decent SSD drive with a lot of space you will run into a lot of problems. Such as the infamous memory leak that is still not fixed (I ran into it again today).Best way to do it?1- Develop your contracts using solidity (latest version) and truffle (yes thats good for that!)2- Test and re-test, if you have a budget make them audited !3- Merge your contracts with a tool like: sol-merger (npm i -g sol-merger)4- Use the online ethereum compiler (https://ethereum.github.io/browser-solidity/)5- Once compiled, click on details, it will give you a javascript with the ABI and Compiled code of your contract.6- You can use parity, contract tab, deploy paste your contract ABI and compiled code, do not forget to tick advanced parameters if you have parameters you need to include (per example wallet address)7- Set your gas, deploy and enjoy !I hope this did save you a lot of headaches!As self promotion phase 2 of Kryptopy Network pre-sale is currently running at https://www.kryptopy.com if you like this article feel free to pitch 0.1ether or more in it :) Thank you for your support in advance.Nick", "responses": 2, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Truffle", "Programming", "Blockchain", "Smart Contracts"]}, {"title": "Crazy Problems You\u2019ll See During Truffle Migrations", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@lpreimesberger/crazy-problems-youll-see-during-truffle-migrations-873070a4c32d?source=search_post", "author_name": "lee preimesberger", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@lpreimesberger", "publish_date": "2018-02-22", "last_modified_date": "2018-03-24", "readtime": "2.73", "claps": 62, "voters": 4, "content": "Ah crap \u2014 I just wanted some catnip\u2026Crazy Problems You\u2019ll See During Truffle Migrationslee preimesbergerFollowFeb 22, 2018 \u00b7 3 min readWoot \u2014 yeah. You went through months of work, and you have a bad ass contract you want to send out into the wild (foolishly, if you didn\u2019t test on Rinkeby) or test.Well, you are in for a world of pain brother or sister or whatever name you prefer. Strap yourself in and brace yourself for the top \u2018oh crap\u2019 problems you are gonna face.Oh Crap \u2014 how do I put this on test/livenet?Ha \u2014 it seemed so easy. just do truffle test and magic happens. But you can\u2019t deploy that. The bytecode isn\u2019t available. Even it is was \u2014 mist is almost always broken and Ethereum Wallet is even worse. How you actually push this thing out? If you are trying to go directly to livenet you\u2019re not smart. Stop it. I don\u2019t have cut and paste for that just because it\u2019s a bad idea.I\u2019ve say it\u2019s easy, but it\u2019s not. First, you need to start geth locally. By default, truffle is going to start/connect to a temp instance. You need to override that. This is what I use to connect to Rinkeby:geth --fast --rpc --rpcport '9999' --unlock <my wallet address> --password <text file with your passwords> --datadir /home/lpreimesberger/bulk/rinkeby/ --rinkebyObviously \u2014 livenet is different because you don\u2019t have the \u2014 rinkeby clause. \u2018bulk\u2019 points to a large NAS box on my home network. You can skip that point if you don\u2019t use multiple machines or have lots of space in your home directory.You then tell truffle about this by updating truffle.js and truffle-config.js.

We assume that your project has been set up using the popular tool Truffle, though the workflow should be easily adaptable to other tools.Since ThunderCore is compatible with Ethereum, migrating an existing Dapp to ThunderCore is as easy as installing a package and changing a couple of lines in your config.01 Installing dependenciesRun the following command in your project\u2019s root directory (where the contracts directory is located):\u200bnpm install truffle-hdwallet-provider web3-provider-engine02 Update Truffle configOpen up truffle.js (or truffle-config.js if you are using Windows) and add the following code to the top of the file:let HDWalletProvider = require(\u2018truffle-hdwallet-provider\u2019)let mnemonic = \u201c<the mnemonic for your private key>\u201dNote that the mnemonic variable needs to be set to a real mnemonic.Now, in your module exports, include a thunder section under the networks section, like the following:module.exports = {networks: {thunder: {provider: () => HDWalletProvider(mnemonic, \u201chttps://testnet-rpc.thundercore.com:8544\u201c),network_id: \u201c*\u201d,gas: 3000000,gasPrice: 50000000000}}}Here you can find a complete example of a valid truffle.js that works with ThunderCore.03 Deploy smart contracts on ThunderCoreTo deploy your smart contracts on ThunderCore, simply run:truffle migrate \u2014 network thunderIf you didn\u2019t see any error messages, you should be all set. It was that easy!04 Speed comparison with Ethereum\u2019s Rinkeby TestnetHere is a side-by-side comparison of the same Dapp(the same frontend and same smart contracts) but deployed to Ethereum\u2019s Rinkeby Testnet versus ThunderCore Testnet.Note that smart contracts are only a part of the overall Dapp. For instance, you still need to customize your frontend so that it uses the smart contracts deployed on ThunderCore. We won\u2019t detail the steps here since they are very much dependent on your specific project, but feel free to ask for help in our Discord channel.\u200bA few things to NoteIf your Dapp depends on the block number, it requires a simple change. Contact us for more info at support@thundertoken.com.If your Dapp depends on ChainID, please email us atsupport@thundertoken.comIf your Dapp depends on an external Ethereum contract, please confirm that those contracts have been migrated to ThunderCore first and then update with the Thunder contract address.If the Dapp specifies the Network ID, it needs to be updated to ThunderCore\u2019s Testnet Chain ID/ Network ID is 18 (Refer to the explanation of Chain ID herehttps://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-155.md)", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Truffle", "Blockchain", "Dapps", "Thundercore"]}, {"title": "Getting started with Solidity development using Truffle", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@letterj/getting-started-with-solidity-development-using-truffle-c5b322a53218?source=search_post", "author_name": "Jay Payne", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@letterj", "publish_date": "2018-06-29", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-29", "readtime": "3.40", "claps": 100, "voters": 4, "content": "Getting started with Solidity development using TruffleJay PayneFollowJun 29, 2018 \u00b7 4 min readUpdated by [Jay Payne] June 28, 2018Updated by Joseph Delong April 9, 2018Presented by Yorke Rhodes January 31, 2017PrerequisitesThe examples shown in this walk-through are done on a GCP preemptive instance running Debian stretchNode.js and the Node Package Manager(npm)Installing these two packages provide the development platform used in this post.commands to install platform packagesSimple Introduction to SolidityInstall and Setup Ethereum Dev and Test EnvironmentInstall truffle and verifyTruffle is the most popular development framework for Ethereum with a mission to make developers life a whole lot easier. Install it by running:sudo npm install -g truffleand then verify it installed correctly by running:truffle.Install ganache-cli and verifyGanache CLI, part of the Truffle suite of Ethereum development tools, is the command line version of Ganache, your personal blockchain for Ethereum development.Ganache CLI uses ethereumjs to simulate full client behavior and make developing Ethereum applications faster, easier, and safer. It also includes all popular RPC functions and features (like events) and can be run deterministically to make development a breeze. Install it by running:sudo npm install -g ganache-cliand then verify that it installed correctly by running:ganache-cliTestRPC was deprecated in favor of ganache-cli and you can use ganache-cli in exactly same way you could previously use TestRPC.Setup to initialize a default truffle projectTo setup the project you need to create an empty directory simplestorage go into it and then create a truffle project inside the empty directory. Create the directory by running mkdir simplestorage then once inside the new directory run truffle init to initialize the new truffle project.The following files and directory structure should be created in the simplestorage directory if the initialization completed successfully.directory listingConfigure truffle to use our ganache-cli clientInside the module.exports section of the truffle.js file the development network needs to be added and following variable set:* host = localhost* port = 8545* network_id = \u201d*\u201d, // Match any network id* gas = 4600000Copy and Paste this into the modules.export section of truffle.js to add the development network.Create a Solidity ContractThe SimpleStorage smart contract will allow the storage of a favorite number mapped to a specific Ethereum address. This favoriteNumbers mapping will be visible to the public. Create a new file in the contracts directory called SimpleStorage.sol. Copy and paste this code into the new file:SimpleStorage smart contractCompile the new ContractTo compile the SimpleStorage contract run truffle compile in the project\u2019s root directory. It should return various pieces of useful information: * helpful warnings * notifications that a new artifacts has been written.Example of the output of the truffle compile commandLaunch the ganache-cli Ethereum test clientTo test the deployment and the functionality of the contract, start up the ganache-cli Ethereum test client in a second Terminal. It has to be up and running to process the deployment and interactions with the SimpleStorage contract.If you do not have the ability to run a second terminal window you can use screen to create sessions for:* editing project files, run compiles and tests scripts* running the Ethereum test client ganache-cliIn either case the second window or session start the ganache-cli test client by running ganache-cli.Deploy the ContractConfigure truffle to deploy the artifact to the glanache-cli network by creating a new file in the migrations directory called 2_deploy_contracts.js.

This tutorial is my effort to share my understanding of the eternal storage model, displaying in a step-by-step tutorial that applies the principles and abstractions of upgradeable contracts within a development environment. For proper discussion and depth of these principles, I refer you to the comprehensive articles cited at the end of the tutorial.SetupInstall Truffle (requires Nodejs 5.0+)npm install -g truffleTruffle also requires an Ethereum client to interact with, and for this tutorial I\u2019ll be simply using the built in truffle develop, an interactive console that also spawns a development blockchain for when you don\u2019t need to work with specific accounts.Start by cloning the repo I created for this tutorial. This uses the contracts pulled from ZeppleinOS labs, a repository that holds many strategies, approaches and study cases used to investigate and develop dApps with ZeppelinOS. Well worth looking at the entire code base here, simply amazing work.git clone https://github.com/fuguefoundation/tutorial-eternal-storage.gitcd tutorial-eternal-storagenpm installThe CodeOkay, now that the dev environment is set up, let\u2019s dig into the code. Open the project in your preferred text editor or IDE (I use VS Code and Sublime Text). As I am still wrapping my head around this design principle, again I refer you to the articles below for proper discussion and background. The README in the repo is also helpful to navigate your way through the inheritance structure. What I will add are a few tips and \u201caha!\u201d moments I discovered along the way, things that may be taken for granted \u2014 but are vital to understanding nonetheless \u2014 by developers who are experts on this topic. I encourage you to leave comments or feedback as well.For a big picture of the design pattern, come to grips with the idea of separating your data from your logic. In this example, the logic is an ERC20 token.Not all the contracts actually \u201cdeploy\u201d (i.e., generate an address) to the blockchain. Look at 2_deploy_contracts.js for more details.Related to the previous point, Proxy.sol is an \u201cabstract contract\u201d and thus can not actually be compiled. It can only serve as a base contract.Pay attention to the inheritance of the logic contracts. Keep track of what functions already exist and which ones are being added or changed.Deploy and interactOk, back in the terminal within the project root directory.trufle compile// You may see some warnings, but this should work finetruffle developtruffle(develop)> migrate// Deploy the contracts: Migrations.sol, EternalStorageProxy, Token_V0, and Token_V1Now let\u2019s establish some helpful variables.truffle(develop)> mainAccount = web3.eth.accounts[0]\u20180x627306090abab3a6e1400e9345bc60c78a8bef57\u2019truffle(develop)> transferAccount = web3.eth.accounts[1]\u20180xf17f52151ebef6c7334fad080c5704d77216b732\u2019truffle(develop)> tokenV0Address = Token_V0.address\u20180xf25186b5081ff5ce73482ad761db0eb0d25abfbf\u2019truffle(develop)> tokenV1Address = Token_V1.address\u20180x75c35c980c0d37ef46df04d31a140b65503c0eed\u2019truffle(develop)> eternalAddress = EternalStorageProxy.address\u20180xaa588d3737b611bafd7bd713445b314bd453a5c8\u2019Establish that version and implementation are not yet set. These are functions/variables that reside in UpgradeabilityStorage. Notice how the contract is called at the address of EternalStorageProxy.truffle(develop)> UpgradeabilityStorage.at(eternalAddress).implementation.call()\u20180x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000\u2019truffle(develop)> UpgradeabilityStorage.at(eternalAddress).version.call()\u2018\u2019Set version and implementation and confirm. Again, note how one contract is cast by another\u2019s address.truffle(develop)> OwnedUpgradeabilityProxy.at(eternalAddress).upgradeTo(\u201c0\u201d, tokenV0Address, {from: mainAccount}).then(function(result){console.log(result)});truffle(develop)> UpgradeabilityStorage.at(eternalAddress).implementation.call()\u20180xf25186b5081ff5ce73482ad761db0eb0d25abfbf\u2019truffle(develop)> UpgradeabilityStorage.at(eternalAddress).version.call()\u20180\u2019Now we check that our logic contract is using Eternal Storage. First, we\u2019ll get an instance of Token_V0 contract cast at the EternalStorageProxy address. This allows the variables to persist between updatestruffle(develop)> var token0truffle(develop)> Token_V0.at(eternalAddress).then(function(instance){token0 = instance;})Now we can call functions directly on the contract instance. Let\u2019s first confirm that the account has a zero balance of our token. Then we\u2019ll mint2018 tokens to an account. Then we transfer some of those tokens to another account.truffle(develop)> token0.balanceOf.call(transferAccount)BigNumber { s: 1, e: 0, c: [ 0 ] }truffle(develop)> token0.mint(mainAccount, 2018, {from: mainAccount}).then(function(result){console.log(result)});truffle(develop)> token0.balanceOf.call(mainAccount)BigNumber { s: 1, e: 3, c: [ 2018 ] }truffle(develop)> token0.transfer(transferAccount, 18, {from: mainAccount}).then(function(result){console.log(result)});BigNumber { s: 1, e: 3, c: [ 18 ] }Notice that if we check the balance using an instance of Token_V1 (also cast through the address of EternalStorageProxy) we get the same balance.truffle(develop)> var token1truffle(develop)> Token_V1.at(eternalAddress).then(function(instance){token1 = instance;})truffle(develop)> token1.balanceOf.call(transferAccount)BigNumber { s: 1, e: 0, c: [ 18 ] }Also note that if we try to call any of the added functionality in version 1, we get an error since version 1 is not yet able to write to Eternal Storage.truffle(develop)> token1.finishMinting({from: mainAccount}).then(function(result){console.log(result)});Error: VM Exception while processing transaction: revertUpgrade the logic contractWe\u2019ve already deployed our updated version 1 contract so we\u2019re ready to go. Of course, a more likely workflow would be to deploy an update once you or your team actually come up with these new features. The more you consider these building blocks at the beginning (we are dealing with an immutable ledger after all) the easier such updates should be. Nevertheless, you would deploy the new logic contract using the proper inheritance, in this case, contract Token_V1 is Token_V0. Now update the implementation and version in OwnedUpgradeabilityProxy as before.truffle(develop)> OwnedUpgradeabilityProxy.at(eternalAddress).upgradeTo(\u201c1\u201d, tokenV1Address, {from: mainAccount}).then(function(result){console.log(result)});truffle(develop)> UpgradeabilityStorage.at(eternalAddress).version.call()\u20181\u2019Let\u2019s use some of the new functionality in Version 1. Initialize the new logic contract, set the owner, and mint some more tokens. Finally, finish minting.truffle(develop)> token1.initialize(mainAccount, {from:mainAccount}).then(function(result){console.log(result)});truffle(develop)> token1.initialized.call()truetruffle(develop)> token0.mint(mainAccount, 2018, {from: mainAccount}).then(function(result){console.log(result)});truffle(develop)> token0.totalSupply.call()BigNumber { s: 1, e: 3, c: [ 4036 ] }truffle(develop)> token1.totalSupply.call()BigNumber { s: 1, e: 3, c: [ 4036 ] }truffle(develop)> token1.finishMinting({from:mainAccount}).then(function(result){console.log(result)});truffle(develop)> token1.mintingFinished.call()truetruffle(develop)> token1.mint(mainAccount, 2018, {from: mainAccount}).then(function(result){console.log(result)})//error \u2014 revert (this will now also revert if you call it on token0 as well)Conclusion and next stepsI hope this was helpful for those (like myself) that are looking to see a more step-by-step approach to upgradeable smart contracts and the eternal storage model specifically. Again, to really understand this tutorial, there is a presumption that you have done the background reading.Next, I plan to make a similar tutorial only using Rootstock and to understand more about how the data layer of upgradeable contracts and storage interact. I\u2019m also considering building on this code to create an Angular frontend and encapsulate it as a Truffle Box, something to give back to these amazing open source projects building the decentralized web.

In this section, we will deploy the same contract using Truffle framework and Ganache-CLI. Truffle framework has made a lot of things easy and hides the boilerplate code. So let's start \u2014Ethereum\u2019 Smart Contract using Truffle Framework & Ganache-CLIDeploying using Truffle Framework and Ganache-CLIFirst, we need to install truffle. Let\u2019s install the truffle globally.$ npm install -g truffleIn the same terminal window, Create a new project/folder \u2018ethereumdapp\u2019 and run below command.$ truffle unbox webpackor$ truffle initIf using the first command, you will see below in the command line$ Downloading...Unpacking...Setting up...Unbox successful. Sweet!Commands:Compile:              truffle compileMigrate:              truffle migrateTest contracts:       truffle testRun linter:           npm run lintRun dev server:       npm run devBuild for production: npm run buildThis will set up the complete project. You can see a few more contracts are created under contracts folder. Also, 1_initial_migration.js and 2_deploy_contracts.js are created under the migrations folder. In addition to it, there is truffle-config.js created. We should uncomment the development section under network to connect to Ganache as shown below.Once this setup is done, then copy the NotarizedDocument.sol file created earlier, into the folder \u201ccontracts\u201d.

To interact with contract lets go to truffle console and type below commands one by one and keep checking ganache console in another window.$ truffle consoletruffle(development)> NotarizedDocument.deployed()truffle(development)> let notarizedDocInstance = await NotarizedDocument.deployed()Or truffle(development)> NotarizedDocument.deployed().then(instance => {notarizedDocInstance = instance})When you get the instance, let\u2019s invoke the first method of NotarizeDocument contract which is notarized and pass some string value.truffle(development)> notarizedDocInstance.notarize(\"Hello Romil!!\")As soon as you run this in the truffle console, you can see another block created in the ganache console and below in the truffle console.{ tx:  '0x6da9b7c2509118233f564c86786d4c7e9206523d9bcecc3e80ec22b9edcef58e',  receipt:   { transactionHash:      '0x6da9b7c2509118233f564c86786d4c7e9206523d9bcecc3e80ec22b9edcef58e',     transactionIndex: 0,     blockHash:      '0xcc169d76a0098aa7b859ae1d6d6ed67920a6d15d0281c26ae0507446b6b16bee',     blockNumber: 5,     from: '0xce599e446b1a8fea3905df54224ebcaccbb03d41',     to: '0x2cd3d3090b4c62840b7b46e5237fe8e951de78b2',     gasUsed: 45005,     cumulativeGasUsed: 45005,     contractAddress: null,     logs: [],     status: true,     logsBloom:'',     v: '0x1c',     r:'',     s:'',     rawLogs: [] },  logs: [] }To check if this document is created, call the checkDocument method of the contract.truffle(development)> instance.checkDocument(\"Hello Romil!!\")This will return true in the console.Now its time for you to play around with Truffle framework. For sure Truffle has made the things easy by hiding lots of execution which we were able to see using web3js. The complete code can be found here.So let\u2019s create more contracts and deploy them over the ganache before deploying over the main net.

Drizzle is basically Truffle Framework plus Create-React-App. The great thing about this box is that it integrates easily with ganache-cli and MetaMask. Its the only Truffle box (that I\u2019m aware of) that comes prepackaged with Web3 1.0.0 instead of Web3 0.20, which means we can use Async/Await instead of Promises!However, as is often the case with Ethereum/Solidity development, there are some breaking changes and it took a few fixes to get it running.Our end goal is the official Drizzle start screen:As of mid-July 2018, here is what I had to do to get the start screen up and running:Assumptions:Node -v 8.9.4NPM -v 6.0.0You have MetaMask installed as a Chrome Extension.Open a terminal window and make a folder to put the truffle boxmkdir MyDrizzleFolder(you can call this whatever you want)2.

Compilation Errors with OpenZeppelin when \u201ctruffle compile\u201dIf you get errors similar to this:openzeppelin-solidity/contracts/token/ERC20.ERC20sol:1:1: SyntaxError: Source file requires different compiler version (current compiler is 0.4.23+commit.124ca40d.Emscripten.clang \u2014 note that nightly builds are considered to be strictly less than the released versionpragma solidity ^0.4.24;Then go open your directory and go into node_modules/openzeppelin-solidity/contracts/token/ and open up all the solidity contracts and change them from ^0.4.24 to ^0.4.23. I had to do this for the all the solidity contracts in the ERC20 and ERC721 folders, as well as the math/SafeMath solidity contracts before it would compile. I did it all manually, and it took a few minutes. There may be a faster way, but manually was quick enough.4. Console Compilation Errors on the Front EndIf you still don\u2019t see the official start screen, and you open your development console in the Chrome and get an error like this:TypeError: (0 , _drizzle.generateContractsInitialState) is not a functionThen the problem is that you may need to update some Drizzle packages, so in the terminal run the following:cd MyDrizzleFoldernpm install --save drizzle-reactnpm install --save drizzleSee the following Github pull request https://github.com/truffle-box/drizzle-box/issues/24 for further explanation.trufflesuite/drizzle-reactContribute to drizzle-react development by creating an account on GitHub.github.comtrufflesuite/drizzledrizzle - Reactive Ethereum datastore for dapp UIs.github.com5.

You will find its contracts helpful for many of your projects.The most obvious use of OpenZeppelin is its implementations of ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens. But there is a lot more here that can save us from reinventing the wheel. There are contracts for access control, crowdsales, and escrow payments \u2014 just to name a few.Truffle (https://truffleframework.com) is a development framework you can use for Solidity projects. It makes your life easier in a lot of ways; but the biggest value add is how it helps you test your contracts.Right out of the box, Truffle lets you compile and migrate your contracts to a local test network. From there you can either use the Truffle console to manually interact with the deployed contracts, or run unit tests written in Javascript with Mocha and Chai.InstallationFirst we install Truffle (requires Node.js v8.9.4 or later):npm install -g truffleNext we use Truffle to initialize a new project for us:mkdir MyProject && cd MyProjecttruffle initNow we install OpenZeppelin in our new project:npm init -ynpm install --save-exact openzeppelin-solidityWe use --save-exact because minor version updates to OpenZeppelin can introduce breaking changes.Configure Solidity compilerOpenZeppelin contracts require the Solidity 0.5.2 compiler (solc), but Truffle ships with solc 0.5.0 by default. If we want to use OpenZeppelin with our own contracts, we must configure Truffle to use 0.5.2.Let\u2019s add the following to ./truffle-config.js:module.exports = {  compilers: {    solc: {      version: \u201c0.5.2\u201d    }  }}Do not worry about installing the correct compiler version manually. Truffle will download it automatically with this configuration.Write Smart ContractsWhen you initialize a project with Truffle, it creates a ./contracts directory for your Solidity source code. Inside you will see Migrations.sol which is used to manage your contract migrations, so don\u2019t delete it.Any contract created inside this directory will be automatically detected by Truffle.Import OpenZeppelin librariesOnce you start writing your own Solidity smart contracts, using OpenZeppelin is easy. Because Truffle understands NPM packages, Solidity libraries installed to ./node_modules are readily available without any configuration.For example, importing OpenZeppelin\u2019s ERC-20 implementation is as simple as:import 'openzeppelin-solidity/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol';Deploy with TruffleTruffle\u2019s deployment process is versatile, but if all we want to do is test any smart contracts we\u2019ve created, it couldn\u2019t be more straightforward.Open the Truffle console with:truffle developThis automatically connects to Truffle\u2019s built-in local test network.In the console we run compile and then migrate. Compilation generates the contract bytecode and application binary interface (ABI). Migration sends transactions to the network that create instances of our smart contracts.The Truffle console also exposes contract abstractions and web3.js if we want to manually interact with our contracts after deployment.For example, if we have an ERC-20 token contract called MyToken, we could find out the total supply with:const instance = await MyToken.deployed()instance.totalSupply()Where to go from hereI recommend looking through the OpenZeppelin documentation (docs.openzeppelin.org/docs/get-started.html) to see how your projects can benefit from its library of smart contracts.And of course, keep reading my tutorials to learn more about Solidity development.", "responses": 2, "tags": ["Solidity", "Ethereum", "Openzeppelin"]}, {"title": "Truffle : \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8

I chose BitBucket as my SCM and grabbed the Git URL from my BitBucket home page to connect Codeship and my repository together.Configure TestsIn the Tests tab, you have two command boxes; setup commands and test commands.I used the setup commands to install the required nodejs packages:npm install trufflenpm install ganache-clinpm install run-with-testrpcTruffle is the Ethereum development framework that I\u2019m using to build my distributed application. I expect that you\u2019ll already be familiar with Truffle, but if not, you can read more about it here.Ganache-CLI (previously known as TestRPC) is a tool that simulates the Ethereum client, making it easier to develop smart contracts and distributed applications. Again, I expect that you\u2019ll already be familiar with Ganache-CLI, but if not, you can read more about it here.\u201cRun with TestRPC\u201d is a neat little tool that I found to run a command with TestRPC in the background. This was the simplest way that I could find to run both Ganache-CLI (TestRPC) and truffle tests at the same time.Finally, I configured the test pipeline to run my actual tests:./node_modules/.bin/run-with-testrpc --port 7545 'truffle test'I set the port manually, as this appears to be what Truffle/Ganache-CLI uses by default.SuccessI\u2019m impressed with just how easy it was to get this set up and running. With four commands we have a continuous integration pipeline running tests. I\u2019ll endeavour to come back and update this post if anything changes, but for now, I hope this is helpful to anyone else who is trying to set this up.Happy coding!", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Ethereum Blockchain", "Ethereum Development", "Blockchain", "Blockchain Development"]}, {"title": "Support for browser based wallets with truffle-box", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@quijanoflores/support-for-browser-based-wallets-with-truffle-box-31f8e6d87360?source=search_post", "author_name": "quijano flores", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@quijanoflores", "publish_date": "2017-02-24", "last_modified_date": "2018-04-28", "readtime": "4.16", "claps": 9, "voters": 4, "content": "Support for browser based wallets with truffle-boxquijano floresFollowFeb 24, 2017 \u00b7 5 min readUPDATE: In July 2017, the truffle team at ConsenSys released a set of official boxes http://truffleframework.com/boxes/, the react-auth and react-uport boxes support redux!A reducer to pass web3 to components as a prop from the Redux store. repo can be found here, truffle-box-browser-wallet.Truffle-box has recently published a set of truffle-webpack-react boilerplates that make it easy to create a smart contract application with a React user interface.The boiler plates are fantastic and I am particularly excited about truffle-box-uport.Engaging with smart contracts through your smart phone is going to be a reality soon.Authorising transactions with your finger print from your phone is so future.While exploring these boilerplates, I noticed that the react components weren\u2019t aware of my Metamask browser based wallet. The boilerplates ship with setting the provider to the truffle contracts to `localhost:8545`.Adding a few lines of java script to the truffle-box will make components aware of the Metamask browser based wallet.import Web3 from 'web3'import truffleConfig from './../../truffle-config.js'var web3Location = `http://${truffleConfig.networks.development.host}:${truffleConfig.networks.development.port}`var web3Provided;if (typeof web3 !== 'undefined') {                              // Use the browser based wallet provider.       // DEVELOPER NOTE: removing the next commented line will break the app  // eslint-disable-next-line  web3Provided = new Web3(web3.currentProvider)} else {                                                        // DEVELOPER NOTE: What happens if the   // user does not have a browser based wallet? What happens  // if the Web3 object cannot be initialised with the httpProvider  // given from the location in the truffle-config file?  web3Provided = new Web3(new Web3.providers.HttpProvider(web3Location))}This implementation works well with the truffle-box-react boilerplate and web3Provided can be passed in as a prop to the App component. This implementation becomes cumbersome when the project manages state using Redux because the developer would have to insert this script in every component that wants to use the MetamaskInpageProvider for the smart contract instance.Pass the web3 object as a prop to the component through the Redux storeFor folks that are new to Redux, the egghead video series are excellent.If we want a friendly way to make all of our components aware of the same web3 object we need to get web3 from the Redux store. In order for us to do that we\u2019ll need a web3 reducer that will handle actions appropriately.web3Reducer.js \u2192reducerimport Web3 from 'web3'const provider = new Web3.providers.HttpProvider('http://localhost:8545')const web3 = new Web3(provider)const initialState = {  web3: web3}const web3Reducer = (state = initialState, action) => {  if (action.type === \"WEB_3_INITIALIZE\")   {    return Object.assign({}, state, {      web3: action.payload    })  }  return state}export default web3Reducerweb3Init.js \u2192presentation componentimport React, { Component } from 'react'class Web3Init extends Component {componentDidMount(){        this.props.onWeb3ComponentLoad()  }  render() {    return(    <li className=\"pure-menu-item\">    </li>      )  }}export default Web3InitWeb3InitContainer.js \u2192container componentimport { connect } from 'react-redux'import Web3Init from './Web3Init'import { web3Initialize } from './Web3InitActions'const mapStateToProps = (state, ownProps) => {  return {    web3:state.web3  }}const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => {  return {    onWeb3ComponentLoad: (web3) => {      dispatch(web3Initialize(web3))    }  }}const Web3InitContainer = connect(  mapStateToProps,  mapDispatchToProps)(Web3Init)export default Web3InitContainerWeb3InitActions.js \u2192actionsimport Web3 from 'web3'import truffleConfig from './../../truffle-config.js'var web3Location = `http://${truffleConfig.networks.development.host}:${truffleConfig.networks.development.port}`export const WEB_3_INITIALIZE = 'WEB_3_INITIALIZE'function web3Init(web3) {  return {  type:WEB_3_INITIALIZE,  payload:web3   }}export function web3Initialize() {  return function(dispatch) {    var web3Provided;    if (typeof web3 !== 'undefined') {                                  // Use the browser based wallet provider.           // DEVELOPER NOTE: removing the next commented line will break the app      // eslint-disable-next-line      web3Provided = new Web3(web3.currentProvider)    } else {                                                            // DEVELOPER NOTE: What happens if the       // user does not have a browser based wallet? What happens      // if the Web3 object cannot be initialised with the httpProvider      // given from the location in the truffle-config file?      web3Provided = new Web3(new Web3.providers.HttpProvider(web3Location))    }    dispatch(web3Init(web3Provided))}}Now that we have a reducer for web3, when you want to pass in web3 as a prop to a new component:Define web3 in your mapStateToProps function in your container component.const mapStateToProps = (state, ownProps) => {  return {     web3: state.web3       }}2. In your mapDispatchToProps of your container component, pass web3 into the function that you pass as a prop to your presentation componentconst mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => {  return {    onSignUpFormSubmit: (name, web3) => {       event.preventDefault();    dispatch(signUpUser(name, web3))   }  } }3. In the presentation component, add web3 to the state within the constructor function.4. Finally in your actions file use the web3 to set the providerconst authentication = contract(AuthenticationContract)authentication.setProvider(web3.currentProvider)Some things that I noticed after creating the reducer:web3 does not dispatch to the store immediately after the window loads, it has to wait until the web3Init presentation component loads.This error came up when Metamask is locked and I have not migrated the contracts to the blockchain. I was not able to replicate this again.Uncaught Error: Invalid JSON RPC response: {\u201cid\u201d:1,\u201djsonrpc\u201d:\u201d2.0This warning comes upwarning.js:36 Warning: setState(\u2026): Can only update a mounted or mounting component. This usually means you called setState() on an unmounted component. This is a no-op. Please check the code for the Connect(HiddenOnlyAuth(Component)) component.I believe this is coming up now because web3 is being passed into the unmounted components that are toggled when the user signed up for the first time.There is some buggy behavior:When updating the user name and rejecting the transaction through metamask the ui updates the username, to the user it looks like their transaction went through. If you logout and log back in, you can see that no change was made to the contract.The first time that the user signs up and rejects the transaction has app has the appropriate behavior, if the user has signed up already it allows them to sign up again.After the first time the user signed up, if they try to sign up again and reject the transaction it looks like they\u2019ve signed up again. The user name is the original name from the first signup.This is the first reducer that I\u2019ve created, so I\u2019m very open to edits, feedback and suggestions. :D Thanks!", "responses": 0,

Para desenvolvimento, recomendo o uso do ganache como n\u00f3 (para saber mais clique aqui).Para verificar se a configura\u00e7\u00e3o est\u00e1 correta, use o console do truffle:truffle consoletruffle(development)> web3.eth.accounts[ \u20180xf4c41d2efe13876076edc7b57bf99e64e03a0e76\u2019, \u20180xdf439fa91b11284e43ccdd18dd2a4d51bb60e3dd\u2019, \u20180xc527c89eaa042254376d55ee1e1b1547658f7d1a\u2019, \u20180x104fc667dc1f8fd9b99afb0593d247f7e5bc7e43\u2019, \u20180x887562666d0d19a322903ad7a1bd72c358f02ab2\u2019, \u20180x165867ae592c39ee56a3752cc05101819ab3014a\u2019, \u20180x43c3c0c477083dbf3e174a30244cc2500229f971\u2019, \u20180x96a6db824cf61948c9b482256cfa60ee7065baa3\u2019, \u20180x00cef398593e221c76692f6f885c0e642f85dbc5\u2019, \u20180x5f3e9d6f60ea5505d9685f8dd0d2dbe285985acc\u2019 ]truffle(development)> .exitCom o nosso projeto devidamente configurado e integrado ao nosso n\u00f3 Ethereum, iremos agora compilar, implantar e testar um smart contract de exemplo.Compila\u00e7\u00e3o e Implanta\u00e7\u00e3oIremos utilizar como exemplo o contrato abaixo.

He is leading the Truffle hacking project.Kindly tell us more about your project?We have called this project \u2018Truffle hacking\u2019. The idea is to produce the delicious truffle aroma molecules from bacteria instead of from the fungus. This idea came after a publication in 2015 showing that bacteria and yeast living in symbiosis within the truffle are the main contributors to making the final aromatic molecules that we humans perceive as tasting delicious. The way we proceed is by isolating bacteria and yeasts from truffles, then cultivate them in a wide range of conditions to detect some aroma producer strains. Our next goal is to identify the aroma molecules, sequence the producer strains and possibly move the enzymes responsible for this production to E. coli, or boost the truffle aroma production in the wild strain.Who is/are part of this project (people, company etc.)?We are a team of four people on this project: one microbiologist and three true DIY biologists that are learning all the microbiology techniques along the way.What are the challenges you encountered?The main challenge is time. We are not in a hurry and we do this project in our spare time as a hobby, however cells don\u2019t wait! Very often it is necessary to start a culture for working on it a few days after, and planning all of this in extra work hours can be difficult.How did you get the funding of this project?For now Boslab memberships fees have paid for all the materials necessary (mostly plates, media and truffle for the beginning!), however quite soon we will definitely need to find some funding (Mass spectrometry analysis of the compounds produced, sequencing the genome of a strain, etc\u2026). We\u2019re confident that we will find some support for the project. Some companies have already proposed to help us.What motivates you to create this project?My personal motivation is for the thrill of playing with microbes, understanding how they work, and tweaking them so that they work for me. Another main motivation comes from the interaction with other DIY biologists. Whether they have experience or not, the common trait among all of us is a lot of curiosity, a fascination for biology, and all technologies coming out of it.What equipments did you use/are using?The first essential piece of equipment for us is the autoclave. We also use an incubator, a PCR machine, and a freezer to store our strains.When did you started this project and when do you think it will be finished/when did you finished it?We started almost two months ago, and we have no idea when it will finish!What are your plans after this project?Start another one.(If project is not yet done) Do you think your project would be successful and useful?I am pretty confident we will be successful in identifying truffle producing microbes. Whether we will be able to turn this finding into an easier way to produce \u2018natural\u2019 truffle aromas from microbes, that\u2019s very hard to say.

More than an idea, it was a problem, and for a product guy like me, that is honey.The problem wasn\u2019t an easy one: the truffle market is unregulated, and anyone can sell a Chinese truffle as an expensive Italian one (nothing against the Chinese truffles, btw).Looking at the truffle market worldwide, it is easy to see how this can be an opportunity for smart people to make easy money. We are talking about thousands of tons worldwide, and the price can vary from 150\u20ac to 3,000\u20ac per kilogram.We decided that we want to do something for this market.Not all truffles are born equalThere are several varieties of truffles, from the summer black to the rare and tasty white.The fact that truffles are so expensive is due to a mix of lack of abundance and the strict control of the market. The demand is there, especially from rich countries like the Emirates where you can pay up to $10,000 for a white truffle while the same truffle in Italy goes for 3000\u20ac.Controlling the abundance skews the price in favour of the distributors, not necessarily towards the truffle hunter.It\u2019s a pig businessHelping the truffle market does not mean giving more power to the already dominant distributors; it means helping the truffle hunters who are getting the smallest slice of the pie.The same truffles you buy for 300 \u20ac per kilogram were sold by the hunter for somewhere between 40 and 50 \u20ac, if not less.Hunting truffles is a job, but it is also a passion. It is about leaving early in the morning to hit the woods with your trusted dog or pig and hunting for truffles in the bushes \u2014 getting dirty in the mud for maybe half a kilo of truffles.This job is mainly about a \u201clove for mother nature\u201d. The hunter builds a relationship with his dog that lasts a lifetime.It\u2019s worth noting that a fully trained truffle-hunting dog or pig can be worth 3,000 to 4,000 \u20ac.False truffles are not fresh trufflesIn a market like this, where there is a thin line between myth and reality, it is easy to understand how falsification can be a huge business.The primary value of a truffle lies in its flavour, and the flavour decay is a direct function of the time the truffle spends out of the dirt.A truffle from China that will be sold in London has to travel 5,000 miles via either land or air. This trip very likely will take up to 3\u20134 days in the best-case scenario. As time goes by, the flavour goes as well, so, to avoid this, some companies freeze the products, a process that kills the organoleptic properties of every vegetable product.This, per se, might not be an issue if it weren\u2019t that some of these truffles are sold as fresh picked and as \u201cfrom Italy\u201d to justify an inflated price.The blockchain is here to helpIn this scenario, a missing piece is a tracking tool that can guarantee the immutability of the information.Immutability, that\u2019s precisely what blockchain is about.This is a mission for the blockchain then!The hypothesis we are trying to validate with humbria.it is:A blockchain-powered tracking system will help the truffle industry.The system we designed is a complete platform that starts with the truffle hunter taking a picture of the mushroom (yes, truffles are mushrooms) using the Humbria mobile app. At the same time, the truffle is associated with a unique QR code.The information is then stored in a smart contract on the public blockchain, where all the essential features of the truffle are saved in an immutable block.The happy consumer can then use the QR code and the app to track the truffle and ensure its freshness and location of origin.Dynamic pricingThe incredible blockchain does not stop here. As said earlier, the price of the truffle is directly connected with its freshness.The smart contract can then autonomously change the price of the truffle every day that passes to provide a fair market price to the consumer.Using blockchain technology to do this guarantees that the pricing logic will be clear and the price calculated by an automated system, removing the risks of an intermediary.This is good for everyoneAt humbria.it, we know we can influence the truffle market to provide:a fair price for the truffle hunter, a fair cut and more volume for the distributors, a fair price, and a certified, fresh product for the consumer.Only truffles?Not at all; the same system can be used to track any perishable, valuable product from mushrooms and caviar to coffee.Sky\u2026 or ground is the limit!", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Truffle", "Blockchain", "Foodtech", "Smart Contracts"]}, {"title": "Basic Debugging Techniques for Truffle Development", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@andersonmmi/basic-debugging-techniques-for-truffle-development-e98cd5e358dc?source=search_post", "author_name": "Aaron Lyn Anderson", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@andersonmmi", "publish_date": "2017-12-22", "last_modified_date": "2018-04-07", "readtime": "1.22", "claps": 23, "voters": 3, "content": "Basic Debugging Techniques for Truffle DevelopmentAaron Lyn AndersonFollowDec 22, 2017 \u00b7 2 min readTruffle is a very new framework for building \u00d0Apps and debugging can be a little more difficult than just googling StackOverflow. To save you hours of cursing and table flipping, here is a list of debugging techniques that you should always try first.Update Truffle: if your contract methods are throwing errors about invalid numbers of arguments or invalid opcodes, and the darn function doesn\u2019t even have parameters in it\u2019s definition, just run $ npm install -g truffle and restart your \u00d0App.Delete the build folder: if it\u2019s still throwing the errors from step 1, there might be some lingering errors in your build files. Delete your build folder and run $ truffle compile. This will create a new build folder with the most up to date build files.Update your ABI.js files: if you followed my advice in this article and created ABI export files, you can get a VM error in your browser console if your ABI\u2019s aren\u2019t up to date. Just update the ABI export files with the ABI arrays from your build files. The addition or subtraction of a single keyword in your solidity file can throw your whole ABI out of sync with the deployed contract. So go ahead and update your ABI.js files, run $ truffle develop, then truffle migrate.Always try these steps first and you\u2019ll save yourself a lot of time and frustration.

I know that buying such item with that crazy amount of money might sound weird for some. But knowing what truffle really is and the way it\u2019s harvested will surely make it sensible for you to believe that people will buy such a pricey product.Now, let us discover some important facts about truffle and why is it so expensive to buy such delicacy. After reading this article maybe won\u2019t hesitate to buy a jar of Italian black truffle salt any more!What Is a Truffle?A truffle is an edible fungus that usually grows underground. This fungi can live 2.5 up to 10 centimeter below the ground attaching its roots to oak trees or hazelnuts. The relationship between the truffles and the host tree is mutualistic. Truffles are getting their nourishments from the host tree and in return, the fungi is giving off phosphorus which is elemental to the tree\u2019s well being. Once the truffles have become matured for at least five years of age, the fungi will produce a fruiting body that can be harvested by means of digging the ground. Even though classified as mushroom, truffles appears to be similar to a potato than to a mushroom.There are two expensive type of truffles: The black truffles from France and the white truffles from Italy.Black trufflesBlack truffles or the tuber melonosporum are fungus that usually live under oak trees in months of September to December. This type of truffle is a native to the south west of France. A pound of black truffle can sell for at least $400 USD a pound.White trufflesThe white truffle of the tuber magnatum usually grow on the roots hazel and oak trees in the autumn and winter months. Compared to black truffles, the white truffles are believed to be more flavorful, so it can be sold for as much as $2,200 per pound.These varieties of fungi are not harvested using the conventional way mushrooms are. Pigs or trained sniffing dogs are used to locate and dig out such pricey ingredients.Truffles from ChinaChina has its own truffle variety that has been the source of a recent truffle controversy. Chinese truffles has long been used to feed pigs until one day a businessman decided to market these truffles to French. Yes, these chines truffles, later labeled as fake truffles are way much cheaper but a complete waste because it doesn\u2019t have the aroma or the flavor of a genuine black or white truffles. And because fake truffles started to flood the truffle market, French businessmen and truffle growers wage war against the Chinese truffle, the one that they accused a product that has been used to fool customers.Truffle SaltsNow that you know what truffle is and why is it so expensive, you will not be amazed how pricey a jar of black truffle salt might be. Truffle salts are special kind of salt infused with the aroma and flavor of genuine black truffle salt from France. Truffle salts are intended as finishing salt for gourmet foods. You can sprinkle this salt to almost any kind of food if you are looking for an extra ordinary way of enjoying your meal. A jar of black truffle sea salt is usually $20-$30 depending on the brand. Though it\u2019s expensive, it can last a long time considering it\u2019s just a finishing salt and not intended for cooking.

You can\u2019t just pick a brand because as you know, truffle salts are quite expensive. And because thousands of sellers are claiming that they have the most authentic, most flavorful truffle salts, it\u2019s imperative that you have to perform your due diligence before ordering one.Here are some tips to consider before buying your truffle salts.Find the brand that uses true trufflesHere is the truth about truffle salts: 99% of Italian black truffle sea salt manufacturers uses estivi as substitute to the genuine truffles. Estivi, also known as summer truffles resembles a genuine truffles but it barely has a truffle flavor. The meager flavor of estivi quickly vanishes when it is infused in salt. Some people say that Estivi are truffles, yes maybe it\u2019s true but the point is the flavor of this fake truffle is nothing compared with the white or black truffles from France and Italy that made the truffle salts so expensive. Remember that we aren\u2019t just buying the \u201ctruffles\u201d label on our truffle salts, we are more interested in the unique flavor that the truffle salt could bring to our meal.Some brands of truffle salts uses truffle oils infused on the salt. And I had an experience buying an Italian black truffle sea salt that at first, the truffle flavor was quite strong because I think the flavorful oil was absorb by the salt. But a couple of weeks later after opening the jar, I noticed that the flavor has significantly diminished. It was late when I read the label and I found out the manufacturer used summer truffles, Estivi not the genuine one.Yes, there are brands that uses genuine truffle oil but the majority do not contain the actual black or white truffles. So check the label first before getting one, or if you are ordering one, do yourself a favor by checking in the reviews before ordering. Majority of truffle salts sell at around $20 \u2014 $30 so you have to be very careful in choosing the best truffle saltLook for the brand that uses the correct amount of truffle saltsNow that you have probably found the brand that sells truffle salts that uses genuine truffles, you have to make sure that they are using enough amount of truffles to their salts. My favorite Italian black truffle sea salt from CaravelGourmet.com has 10% genuine black truffles infused to the sea salt. Do not buy truffle salts from a seller if you can\u2019t find a reliable information as to how much truffles are in their salts written on their label.Now that you know my criteria in buying the best truffle salts out there, have a look at my favorite Italian black truffle sea salt and enjoy every food with this amazing truffle salt!", "responses": 1, "tags": ["Sea Salt", "Truffle Salt", "Truffle", "Gourmet", "Cooking"]}, {"title": "Truffle Butter Garlic Bread", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@mirashah/truffle-butter-garlic-bread-776ec4d17521?source=search_post", "author_name": "Mira Shah", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@mirashah", "publish_date": "2015-08-12", "last_modified_date": "2018-05-05", "readtime": "2.25", "claps": 1, "voters": 1, "content": "Truffle Butter Garlic Bread2 of my favorite ingredients in 1 magical recipeMira ShahFollowAug 12, 2015 \u00b7 3 min readI know I promised you the recipe for my truffle butter garlic bread in my previous post(baked eggplant parmesan), so here it is. If I had to pick one food to eat for the rest of my life, it would have to be without a doubt, garlic bread! For me, there is no such thing as too much garlic; the more garlic, the better:) When garlic is combined with butter(another weakness of mine) on soft chewy bread, I get weak in the knees and my mouth starts to salivate. So, I thought I would get a little crazy and enhance this already divine bread with truffle oil!!! Truffle oil has become my new obsession and friend in the kitchen. It definitely doesn\u2019t pair with everything, or even all cuisines, but when it does, it creates pure magic. There are many types of truffle oil, but I used white truffle oil. Here is the magic that I created in my kitchen:Truffle Butter Garlic Bread2 small or 1 large loaf of French, Italian, or Ciabatta bread (a soft, chewy consistency)1/2 stick of softened, unsalted butter1/4 cup white truffle oil5\u20136 cloves of minced garlicfreshly grated parmesan cheesefresh basil, choppedfresh oregano, choppedsea salt and black pepperPreparation for the garlic bread:Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F and line a baking sheet with foil. Start by combining the butter, truffle oil, garlic, parmesan cheese, and fresh herbs in a bowl until well incorporated. You can add as much or little parmesan cheese per your liking. I\u2019m a cheese addict so I definitely added a good amount. Cut the loaf of bread in half, lengthwise, and spread the mixture evenly on both sides. Sprinkle with black pepper and sea salt on top.I used 1 large loaf of French bread because I like the chewy consistency of French bread. You can also use any combination of fresh herbs such as parsley and fresh rosemary. This is right before I placed them in the oven.Bake the bread for about 15 minutes until it becomes golden brown and your entire kitchen is infused with a garlic aroma.This is right after I took the bread out of the oven. Do you notice the golden brown edges?!Cut the bread into pieces and serve alongside with your favorite pasta dish, pizza, or just enjoy it on its own. As you bite into this magical bread, you will be with hit with an immediate garlicky, buttery goodness, followed by an herbaciousness from the fresh basil and oregano and a hint of truffle bliss will continue to linger in your mouth throughout this experience, without it being overpowering. So go ahead and VEG OUT! Can your mouth handle the magic?Can you small the garlicky goodness? Don\u2019t you wish this was a scratch and sniff picture?

Truffle is the best development framework for Ethereum that we\u2019ve encountered.Truffle comes with a demo app, Pet Shop, which is similar to the old J2EE demo app. I\u2019m not going to rewrite the Truffle Pet Shop tutorial, which you can find here. Instead, I\u2019ve already implemented the Truffle Pet Shop locally on my Mac OS X. The goal of this tutorial is to get this demo app to run on an AWS EC2 instance on my own test network. I\u2019ve checked in the completed Truffle Pet Shop tutorial into Github, https://github.com/joel-maws/truffle-pet-shop. Let\u2019s get started!For this tutorial, you will need to have the following items:AWS Account. If you don\u2019t have one, you can sign up here.EC2 micro instance. This can be procuredf from your AWS account.You\u2019ll need to be able to ssh into the EC2 micro instance.You\u2019ll need to install Node.js > 6.0.0 to the micro instance. I installed Node.js 6.11.2. You can install Node.js by following these steps as specified by Amazon.Next, you\u2019re going to install TestRPC and Truffle. TestRPC is the test environment that makes it much easier to run your own testnet. We have another blog posts that describes how to create a CustomGenesis.json block for testing here. For this tutorial, save yourself the trouble. Use TestRPC.After you ssh into the micro instance, type the first command below, which will install TestRPC. Next, type the second command, which will install the Truffle development framework into your current directory.npm install -g ethereumjs-testrpcnpm install -g truffleNext, we\u2019re going to pull the completed Pet Shop demo from my Github repo by typing the first command into the ssh terminal. We\u2019ll then run npm update in the same terminal to update our node_modules.git clone https://github.com/joel-maws/truffle-pet-shop.gitnpm updateAfter the npm update is performed, go into the node_modules directory to ensure that the modules are populated.Now, we need to start up the TestRPC Ethereum server. In order to do this, you\u2019ll want to open another command shell, ssh into the EC2 instance, and run TestRPC. When you run TestRPC, you\u2019ll want to make note of the available accounts, private keys, and mnemonics.After you\u2019ve started TestRPC, it should be listening on port 8545. Next, go back to your initial ssh terminal. If you\u2019re cheap like me and you\u2019re running this on an EC2 micro instance, then you\u2019ll want to increase your swap space. Otherwise, your TestRPC instance will run out of RAM during compilation of the source code. You\u2019ll want to create a 1 GB swap file. In the initial ssh terminal, type the following commands to create a permanent swap file:sudo /bin/dd if=/dev/zero of=/var/swap.1 bs=1M count=1024sudo /sbin/mkswap /var/swap.1sudo chmod 600 /var/swap.1sudo /sbin/swapon /var/swap.1To enable the swap file by default after reboot, add this line to/etc/fstabswap /var/swap.1 swap defaults 0 0Next, return to the directory where you performed the git clone. When we pulled down the source code from Github, we didn\u2019t build the binaries. Solidity is a compiled language that runs on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), so we\u2019ll want to compile the source code into bytecode so we can deploy the bytecode to the blockchain. Type the following command into the ssh terminal to compile the contracts:truffle compileYou should see the following:ubuntu@ip-172-31-28-110:~/truffle-pet-shop$ truffle compileCompiling ./contracts/Adoption.sol...Compiling ./contracts/Migrations.sol...Writing artifacts to ./build/contractsNow that we\u2019ve successfully compiled our contracts, it\u2019s time to migrate them to the blockchain. Truffle comes with a migration deployment framework which is very similar to Ruby on Rails schema migration.You\u2019ll run the following command shell in the terminal:truffle migrateYou should see the following output:ubuntu@ip-172-31-28-110:~/truffle-pet-shop$ truffle migrateUsing network 'development'.Running migration: 1_initial_migration.js  Deploying Migrations...  ... 0x9ec8c0d6d406d916bd586e9ffdbe7734268bd56c4e5d584095e8835421fe3eae  Migrations: 0xdfe7aba2130ae5b4f1dbcca1271500624908770fSaving successful migration to network...  ... 0xd760961f69ff0b635a27881607da4a8377605bb32a438d5f284f490006d952eaSaving artifacts...Running migration: 2_deploy_contracts.js  Deploying Adoption...  ... 0x0d59a5b2b006b1ed904f8e5a953dedee4782c02bf5c0fe2d38fbc00acc7b13a6  Adoption: 0x60a992a4be13df50000c2945ac84bb42316a40adSaving successful migration to network...  ... 0xf2376f5e0ca4517b2c1fd56a01f1cd1aa3fddc254f05ea94599812386014db18Saving artifacts...In your other terminal shell that is running TestRPC, you should see output that resembles the following:Listening on localhost:8545net_versioneth_accountseth_accountsnet_versionnet_versioneth_sendTransaction  Transaction: 0x9ec8c0d6d406d916bd586e9ffdbe7734268bd56c4e5d584095e8835421fe3eae  Contract created: 0xdfe7aba2130ae5b4f1dbcca1271500624908770f  Gas usage: 201556  Block Number: 1  Block Time: Thu Aug 24 2017 05:17:13 GMT+0000 (UTC)eth_newBlockFiltereth_getFilterChangeseth_getTransactionReceipteth_getCodeeth_uninstallFilterOur contracts now reside on the TestRPC blockchain. We\u2019re most of the way there.Now, we need to host the web app. For this tutorial, we\u2019ll use the lite-server as it\u2019s a lightweight web server that comes with the Truffle PetShop app. The invocation of the lite-server is specified in the package.json of the demo.We\u2019ll run the following command to run the lite server.npm run devThe dev command in package.json will start up the lite-server. For me, the web server will run on port 3001 and the admin console will run on port 3002.

Run this in your command prompt.npm install -g -production windows-build-toolsThen install the Truffle Framework.npm install -g truffleThe truffle-hdwallet-provider-privkey library lets you sign and execute transactions by providing a private key that belongs to an existing Ethereum wallet. This is helpful because I could have an existing Wallet address that was generated earlier in MetaMask and now wish to use it to test my Smart Contract in Truffle.npm install truffle-hdwallet-provider-privkeyCreate a folder in a location of your choice.md trufflekaleidoAnd then enter the folder.cd trufflekaleidoTruffle Framework provides several boilerplates for building Ethereum-based DApps. Here are several boilerplates. Webpack is the most basic boilerplate to start with. We will setup webpack in our /trufflekaleido folder.truffle unbox webpackGetting a Wallet AddressI use Ian Coleman\u2019s website to generate my wallet address and private key. Ian\u2019s mnemonic code key generator allows you to base on a 3 to 24 words mnemonic to generate your wallet\u2019s address and private keys.To do so, select the total number of words to use as mnemonic. Then select Ethereum, and click [Generate].Now scroll down to the Derived Address section and copy any one of the Address/Private Key pair. The \u201cAddress\u201d field is what you can feel free to send to anyone you wish to receive ETH from. The private key is what you will use to sign transactions.Go to your Kaleido console and click \u201cEther Pool\u201d.Then paste the public key here to receive some ETH.If you are wondering how is it possible to generate a wallet address without first connecting to the Blockchain to check if there\u2019s a existing duplicate wallet address on the Blockchain, here\u2019s an article to read. (TLDR) The probability that a randomly generated private key and wallet address has been used is essentially 0.Creating the ContractWe will now write a simple greeting contract. Navigate to /trufflekaleido/contracts folder. Webpack would have added several contracts here by default. Create a new file. You can call it hello.sol.Add the follow codes to hello.sol.pragma solidity >=0.4.22 <0.6.0;contract Mortal {    /* Define variable owner of the type address */    address owner;    /* This constructor is executed at initialization and sets the owner of the contract */    constructor() public { owner = msg.sender; }    /* Function to recover the funds on the contract */    function kill() public { if (msg.sender == owner) selfdestruct(msg.sender); }}contract Greeter is Mortal {    /* Define variable greeting of the type string */    string greeting;    /* This runs when the contract is executed */    constructor(string memory _greeting) public {        greeting = _greeting;    }    /* Main function */    function greet() public view returns (string memory) {        return greeting;    }}This greeter smart contract code comes from https://www.ethereum.org/greeter and does nothing but lets you set and read a \u201cgreeting\u201d variable in the contract.Deploy the Greeter ContractNavigate to the /trufflekaleido/migrations folder and edit 2_deploy_contracts.jsvar mortal = artifacts.require(\"./Mortal\");var greeter = artifacts.require(\"./Greeter\");module.exports = function(deployer) {deployer.deploy(greeter, 'Jack');};Here, we declare mortal and greeter. This corresponds to the contracts of the same name in hello.sol. The contract that we will run is greeter and we instantiate the contract by providing the string \u2018Jack\u2019 to the greeting variable in the greeter contract.Navigate back to /trufflekaleido and edit truffle-config.js. Here\u2019s a sample of how it may look.var HDWalletProvider = require(\"truffle-hdwallet-provider-privkey\"); const privKeys = [\"<replace with your wallet's private key\"]; module.exports = {  networks: {\tganache: {      host: '127.0.0.1',      port: 7545,      network_id: '*' // Match any network id    },    development: {      provider: function() {      return new HDWalletProvider(privKeys, \"<replace with your kaleido node address\");      },      network_id: '*',      gas: 4700000    }  },  // Set default mocha options here, use special reporters etc.  mocha: {    // timeout: 100000  },  // Configure your compilers  compilers: {    solc: {    }  }}We then tell Truffle that truffle-hdwallet-provider-privkey is our Wallet Provider.var HDWalletProvider = require(\"truffle-hdwallet-provider-privkey\");And here, we provide our wallet\u2019s private key.const privKeys = [\"65c2d64f53211d8328c6db8e8bc22341c0f0b8d22989f40f4efd0ed55e3e3d8b\"];Replace the part in \u201c<\u201d and \u201c>\u201d with the private key generated in the previous step. Remember to remove the leading \u201c0x\u201d. So this:0x65c2d64f53211d8328c6db8e8bc22341c0f0b8d22989f40f4efd0ed55e3e3d8bShould look like:const privKeys = [\"65c2d64f53211d8328c6db8e8bc22341c0f0b8d22989f40f4efd0ed55e3e3d8b\"];Truffle Framework allows you to run your Smart Contracts on a local private instance of an Ethereum Blockchain network with Ganache but we want to run our contract in our Kaleido Ethereum instance.

And without a great idea, I thought I\u2019d dive in with a canonical TODO application. Perhaps the most expensive todo app ever made, with around $1.00 transaction fees for each todo item.Stack:TruffleReactNextJSMobxGanacheMaterial UI (Next)First and foremost I just need a boilerplate to start with so I put one together with the above items.Follow along, fork, or check out the code here:wrannaman/TODO-DappTODO-Dapp - A canonical todo Dapp with mobx, react, nextjs, and trufflegithub.comChallenges:Detecting MetaMask or some other connection to the network. There isn\u2019t a good way I found other than a failed connection to determine if a user has MetaMask installed. You just have to see if web3 was injected or not, or if you inject your own, see if you can connect, and if not, show an error message. This feels clunky.Intermediate States are difficult to determine. When a user adds an item to a list, you need to handle showing that the transaction has been submitted (or an error if the transaction rejected). I didn\u2019t handle this well in the app, and it\u2019s confusing for a user. There are several more steps they have to do, such as accept the transaction in metamask and then wait for a response for an unknown amount of time.Events are not working in the app. I had one simple event and could not read the event logs, nor get the event from metamask, you would have to do a lot of persistence and checking in a production ready app to account for this.In short, building a dapp is like building an app, then building another app (smart contract + tests + interfaces), and then writing a ton of code accommodating transactions and transaction states. It\u2019s cumbersome. The tooling is already pretty good. Truffle does almost everything for you and Ganache, outside of timing out after a while, works great. Writing elementary smart contracts is trivial in solidity and there are some cool projects like ethpm aiming to be the npm of smart contracts.Next up is perhaps a more involved, but small Dapp.Click to read more about Dapps", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Solidity", "Ethereum", "Truffle", "Smart Contracts", "Dapps"]}, {"title": "Vegan Truffle \u201cCheesy\u201d Cauliflower", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@MiyokosKitchen/vegan-truffle-cheesy-cauliflower-6d68ae69a4c2?source=search_post", "author_name": "Miyoko's Kitchen", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@MiyokosKitchen", "publish_date": "2015-07-07", "last_modified_date": "2017-10-30", "readtime": "1.10", "claps": 2, "voters": 2, "content": "Vegan Truffle \u201cCheesy\u201d CauliflowerMiyoko's KitchenFollowJul 7, 2015 \u00b7 2 min readDo you miss that piping hot \u201ccheesy\u201d flavor?

Yelp, Trip Advisor, and Google Reviews have that market near cornered.The problem is, there are also countless reviews on those sites. Well, not literally countless. More in the range of 120 million, in the case of Yelp.That makes finding a nice Italian place for dinner an undertaking in itself. This is further complicated by the fact that the great restaurant you do find is usually also one of the most popular, making the task of getting a reservation all the more difficult.My team and I at Upstatement all enjoy a good night out at a solid restaurant, and all shared this same frustration. So for Tank Week (which is the name for a few days we take ever summer to work on internal projects), we decided to try to solve this problem. One of our team members, Matt, happened to be talking about his upcoming trip to Spain and how he was going to go on a guided truffle hunt. Kim, another team member, had not heard of a truffle pig before, so we described how people train pigs to sniff out truffles \u2014 hidden gems of the fungi world \u2014 and dig them up.And so, we just happened upon a perfect name for our proposed application: A service which hunts out and finds the hidden gems of the restaurant world. Instead of being yet another review restaurant to slog through, Truffle Pig would select a restaurant for you based on your preferred interval, setup a reservation, send you an invitation, and even make transportation and babysitting plans if needed.The ChallengeWhile the other team members tackled business logistics, branding, and presentation, I dove into the technical challenges of such a feat. For a comparison, we kept referring to Stitch Fix, a subscription service that sends out a box of clothing personalized to someone\u2019s fashion requirements. It\u2019s more than just putting in your sizes and color preferences though: They use machine learning) as well as a good dose of human review to send people clothes they will enjoy. We figured a similar approach would work great for Truffle Pig as well.Also like Stitch Fix, we wanted to go beyond the basic requirements for personalization. Instead of just asking for someone\u2019s location and their favorite cuisine, we were going to delve much deeper. Some of this type of information is surfaced in metadata on sites like Yelp, such as kid-friendliness or parking availability. We wanted to go deeper than just a binary answer though. For example, a restaurant might be kid friendly, but does mean unruly toddlers will be running through the aisles? Or does it mean you can bring your eight year old without getting dirty looks from couples out for a romantic evening?We could go even further with personalization too, such as what kind of beer menu a bar has, how are the live acts, or how vegetarian friendly is it. The challenge was how to find out this type of information \u2014 especially starting from scratch.Creating a ProfileWe\u2019d start with collecting some basic information about the diner. While this data would be the type you could filter with using existing services, it would help us with drastically narrowing down the list of potential restaurants. For example, while someone may normally enjoy fancy restaurants but doesn\u2019t mind the occasional diner, they might be much more restrictive about the cost of the meal. Other questions along these lines might be dietary restrictions, or how far of a drive it is.Next, the profile would start to get into more personalized questions, such as the aforementioned questions about kid friendliness, attire, or the importance of a good draft beer selection.Some of these questions are binary (i.e., avoiding meat means a BBQ restaurant is a no go). This is something Yelp is good at. Other options are more nebulous though. When asking \u201cIs parking important?\u201d, if we give the user choices of \u201cNope, Somewhat, Very, or Required\u201d, how do we weigh a response of \u201cSomewhat?\u201dThe end goal would be to look at our data set of responses for a restaurant, analyze them for ratings and comments about parking, give that a score, and then weight that score lighter or heavier depending on the user\u2019s importance.Populating the Initial Data SetIn theory, Truffle Pig might one day have a deeply populated database of tens of thousands of restaurant, each with a vast array of data about them. But what could it start with?Luckily, Yelp has an excellent API as well as a generous dataset available for download. We\u2019d start with that so that we could at least show real-life results, even if this would only be the more superficial layer of data (i.e. name, cuisine, address) to start with.Selecting a RestaurantWe now have the dataset and user\u2019s profile. Let\u2019s see what selecting a restaurant would involve.It starts with choosing a cuisine. We know any major ones to avoid based on the profile (i.e. \u201cno fish\u201d would nix any sushi places), so this can just be a random selection. After that cuisine is chosen it would be removed from the pool so that it wasn\u2019t selected again next week. We could add an option to prefer certain cuisines too, allowing diners to discover new restaurants while sticking to more comfortable foods.Next up is limiting the search results to a location. We would start by limiting all results to within a certain mileage from their home, based on factors like if their profile indicates they have a car but prefer walking. In that case, we might include a restaurant that is 20 minutes away (based on Google Map\u2019s API response for travel time at 7 PM on a Friday drive), but give higher preference to a place that\u2019s just a few block walk.Another easy filter is the price. If the user indicated a hard cap of $100 for two people, we can exclude that highly reviewed but super expensive tapas place that just opened.After some of these simple exclusions, we\u2019re left with a list of restaurants any of which the user should have an enjoyable meal at. This is where some of the more advanced selection criteria would come into play.For this example, let\u2019s say that this user really loves craft beer. This is not a simple \u201cyes/no\u201d for whether a restaurant has a good craft beer list. This is something we\u2019d have to delve more into our machine learning for. We\u2019d look at user reviews mentioning craft beer and determine a positive or negative association with each mention, along with a weighting based on the confidence of that assessment. We\u2019d end up with a number we could associate with the strength of the craft beer offerings at these establishments.This number, along with dozens of others for the user\u2019s other preferences, would then all be added together (along with their respective weights) to give each restaurant a final score. It\u2019s then just a matter of selecting that restaurant at the top of the list as our prized truffle, and set up the user with a dinner there.ChallengeThe biggest challenge of this project would be getting an accurate analysis of the restaurant data set, so that we could be sure our algorithm was smartly understanding what reviewers were talking about, and parsing those reviews in a way that we could assign scores to various attributes of that restaurant. In theory, we would start with a team who would look at the algorithm\u2019s results and manually help train it.Oink!Our team was very excited about this concept, and wish that something like it existed so that we would have our dinner plans all set for the weekend. There are some very big problems to tackle with such an ambitious project, including those outside of the technical ones, but we felt confident they were all ones that could be overcome to deliver a truly personalized restaurant experience.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Food", "Design", "Technology"]}, {"title": "Running Truffle Unit Tests with Jest", "post_link": "https://medium.com/asurenetwork/running-truffle-unit-tests-with-jest-91f2ee5f65fd?source=search_post", "author_name": "Fabian Raetz", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@fabian.raetz", "publish_date": "2018-10-15", "last_modified_date": "2018-10-17", "readtime": "5.48", "claps": 2, "voters": 2, "content": "Running Truffle Unit Tests with JestFabian RaetzFollowOct 15, 2018 \u00b7 6 min readFollow us on a journey and explore how unit tests in Truffle are executed and how we use the Jest test framework to improve interoperability with IDE\u2019s like JetBrain WebStorm and Visual Studio CodeThe Truffle framework comes with a handy cli tool that has many useful commands to compile, test, and deploy your smart contracts.truffle test for example, runs all your unit tests and uses the Mocha test framework to execute them. Many IDE\u2019s like JetBrain WebStorm and Visual Studio Code have advanced features to support running Mocha tests from within your IDE including better navigation in test results, running/debugging specific tests, and reexecuting tests after file changes.IDE\u2019s usually support all those features through the Test framework\u2019s test runner and their corresponding command line options. The problem now is that truffle test does not use the default mocha test runner (mocha cli) and does not support the standard command line options but instead implements a custom Mocha test runner with their own command line options.Stefan van den Oord has written a nice article on how truffle test can be integrated into IntelliJ IDEA, so that at least some of the features like the test result explorer work.Another feature of IDE\u2019s is that they display badges next to your test functions which you can use to run/debug your tests. IDE\u2019s look for test framework functions that represent test cases (e.g. describe, context, and it) and display the badges accordingly. Truffle introduces their custom contract function which wraps the standard describe function and adds default before, beforeEach and afterEach lifecycle hooks. The result is that the IDE won\u2019t recognize your tests anymore because it now sees the contract function instead of the describe function and won\u2019t display the corresponding badges anymore.Left: shows badges because WebStorm recognizes test functions / Right: no badges as WebStorm does not recognize contract as test functionTruffle test internalsThe tuffle test command does actually much more than just running your unit tests with Mocha. Before running the tests itstarts and connect to ganache or to your configured network if available;prefetches all available accounts from the connected node;compiles all solidity files (includes unit tests written in Solidity);deploys all artifacts to the connected node;provides globals for easy access within your tests (artifacts, web3, assert, expect, contract).As said before, the contract function adds default before, beforeEach and afterEach lifecycle hooks. The before hook will reset all smart contracts by either using Ganache\u2019s snapshot feature or by redeploying all smart contracts. The beforeEach and afterEach hooks are used to print out the event log in case a test failed.After all unit tests ran, truffle test disconnects from the node.Using the standard Mocha CLIInstead of using truffle test, we could try to solve all features with the standard Mocha framework and use the regular mocha cli to execute our unit tests. To initialize everything we have to run asychronous logic before executing the unit tests. Mocha supports two methods to achieve this:pass the -delay option. Mocha won\u2019t execute your unit tests before your code calls the injected run function.use a global before function and return a promise which resolves ones your initialization is done.The problem with both options is that Mocha will require your test files even before the initialization is complete \u2014 only the execution of tests and lifecycle hooks is delayed. It would not be possible to access artifacts outside of these functions. This would be very inconvenient and would be a common source of errors.So, by default, Mocha does not provide a propper solution to this initialization problem. There exists an issue to that problem. Also there exists mocha-prepare which works a bit like the truffle test command \u2014 do the initialization first and then start Mocha with the little advantage that it would still support all standard mocha command line options.Using Jest test frameworkAs it turns out, the Jest test framework has much better support for early initialization than Mocha has. You can specify a globalSetup and a globalTeardown function through the Jest configuration. Jest will only start once the promise returned on the globalSetup function is resolved.Furthermore you specify a custom testEnvironment class which can specify setup / teardown function for each test file. This allows us to reset the smart contract once per test file. This differs to the truffle test behaviour as truffle testresets smart contracts always before executing tests within the contract function and not once per test file.On the other hand, Jest also has some shortcomings:By default, Jest executes tests in parallel. This will do more bad than good in truffle projects as we\u2019re connected to a single node. We can run all test linearly by providing the -runInBand command line option or by providing our own test runner through the configuration file.Unlike Mocha\u2019s afterEach lifecycle hook, it is not possible in Jest to figure out the test result of the executed test and therefore Jest can\u2019t dynamically print the event log whenever a test failed.You can\u2019t pass additional command line options to the Jest cli. Additional options such as the network to use must be passed through environment variablestruffle-jest npm packageAll in all we felt more comfortable with Jest, which is why we created the truffle-jest npm package. It extracts the functionality of the truffle testcommand into a new package and adapts it to the Jest test framework.Example of truffle project with truffle-jest and JetBrain WebStorm integration.To use Jest in your truffle project runnpm install \u2014 save-dev jest @types/jest truffle-jestand create a corresponding jest.config.js and jest.setup.js in your project. For more details on how to setup truffle-jest, take a look at the README.Note: Tests have to be independent of each other if you want to execute single unit tests from within your IDE or from the command line. You can add a beforeEach function to your jest.setup.js that resets the smart contracts before every test instead of before every test file (see the screenshot above).You should now be able to configure Jest in your IDE or to use it from the command line.Currently, truffle-jest only supports tests written in JavaScript. Tests written in Solidity are not supported yet. Expect truffle-jest to have some rough edges, as this is a very new npm package. We\u2019ll keep improving it over the next few week.ConclusionTruffle comes with awesome support for Ethereum smart contract development out of the box.By using only the standard cli and test functions of a test framework like Jest, we can archive better IDE integration and can benefit from standard command line options, for example, to only run specific tests or watch for file changes.Please give truffle-jest a try if you like it and let us know what you think. Also, we will be attending the ETHBerlin hackathon and would love to talk with you there!We appreciate your support and are always open to any ideas or suggestions that you may like to make regarding of Asure project.Have any questions?Have any questions?Join our Telegram: https://t.me/AsureNetworkFollow us on twitter: https://twitter.com/AsureNetworkCheck out our website: https://www.asure.networkIf you liked the information, clap to encourage us to do more.", "responses": 1, "tags": ["Smart Contracts", "JavaScript", "Blockchain", "Cryptocurrency", "Crypto"]}, {"title": "A Truffle Hunt In Provence", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@Grimod/a-truffle-hunt-in-provence-ed9a9411077c?source=search_post", "author_name": "Francois de Melogue", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@Grimod", "publish_date": "2019-08-04", "last_modified_date": "2019-08-05", "readtime": "7.80", "claps": 10, "voters": 1, "content": "A Truffle Hunt In ProvenceA Cautionary Tale of Thieves, Horny Pigs, and Expensive TubersFrancois de MelogueFollowAug 4 \u00b7 8 min readSECRECY IS EVERYTHINGWe met Johann Pepin at \u2018Les Pastras\u2018, his sprawling organic farm located on a desolate mountain top near the Provencal village of Cadenet under the cloak of secrecy. He cautioned us that \u201cthieves were everywhere\u201d, before instructing us to lock our car doors and gather down below. I must admit I felt a bit uneasy as he slipped a black hood loosely over my head, gently guiding me into the back of an unmarked black van.Moments later we arrived at the edge of an unnamed field in an unnamed town in an unnamed country for what was surely going to be an epic truffle hunt. Such is the way with truffle hunters where secrecy is everything.Johann Pepin explaining the ins and outs of truffle hunting.Secrecy is also common. The exact locations of the parcels of dirt where truffles are uncovered is often guarded from even close friends because a select patch of forest can often translate into a consistent source of wealth over a lifetime. \u2014 excerpt from Ryan Jacobs, \u2018The Dark Side of the Truffle Trade\u2019, The Atlantic January 15th, 2014THE TRUFFLE SPEECHWe sat huddled together on wobbly benches still shaken by our experiences. In front of us were several neat rows of immature oak trees standing resolutely above the br\u00fbl\u00e9ed ground. A line of drip irrigation tubing acted as a buffer between Johann, the trees, and us. Lending the feeling that we were more at a museum exhibit than out in a working field. I began to wonder if Johann and his wife Lisa had installed vibration sensors to protect their trees as museums do for their priceless works.Johann broke the tension with a humorous introduction punctuated with several very interesting anecdotes about all things truffle. It started with a five-decade history of his family\u2019s wonderful 27-acre farm; home to several different varieties of fruit trees (apricots, cherries, plums, apples, pears, pomegranates, figs, almonds, and hazelnuts), grapevines, olive trees, and even beehives. And ended with an in-depth understanding of truffles.HOW TO INOCULATE A TREEJohann delved deep into the quasi-science behind inoculated truffle trees. Inoculating consists of dipping the roots of young oak trees into a truffle puree of your choice. In Provence, this translates to either summer truffles (tuber aestivum) or winter truffles (tuber melanosporum).One gram of mature truffles can contain over one million spores. If the tree farm owner didn\u2019t mistakenly dip their foie gras soaked piece of baguette into the truffle puree then your precious trees should have several thousand truffle spores attached to each set of roots. If I did the math right, given the sheer number of truffles that I\u2019ve personally consumed, then technically I should be a truffle by now.Even if the trees survive the brutally hot Provencal summers and droughts, they still have an incredibly low success rate of actually producing truffles, only about 25%. The real kicker is that it takes 7 to 10 years to find out that the tree is a dud. Truffle farming is not for the weak of heart.A walk through a field of inoculated truffle oaks.THE HOLY TRINITY OF TRUFFLE HUNTERSFor the uninitiated, truffle hunts are very curious things. In the days of old \u2014 and by old I mean when I was young \u2014 pigs were almost exclusively used to find truffles. Researchers in Germany concluded that the signature musk-like scent of truffles is identical to that of a pig. \u201dEmanating from the saliva foam, is smelled by the sow and prompts her standing reflex.\u201d For us laymen, this translates to \u2018truffles smell like a female pig in heat\u2019. What\u2019s worse is the smell is twice as strong in truffles as it is in a pig in her prime on a hot steamy Friday night so you will end up having to fight a sexually frustrated male pig for each and every truffle found. Pigs can be mean, especially desperate horny pigs.Before you let your truffle dog loose, you imprint him by giving him a whiff of what he\u2019s going after \u2014 Sanford uses plastic bottles filled with cotton balls infused with truffle oil. \u201cIt\u2019s just basic conditioning: You give them something to smell, and indicate to them that there\u2019s a reward for them to find that smell,\u201d he says. \u2014 Michael Y. Park, \u201cThe True Story of How a Dog Became a Truffle Hunter Thanks to Magic Mushrooms\u201d, Bon Appetit magazine.The good news is your lovable dog can easily be trained to find the elusive tubers. For dogs, it becomes a fun game of hide and seek rewarded by tiny treats. Johann\u2019s dogs, Eclair and Mirabelle, were trained using tennis balls filled with truffles. Every time they found the ball, they received little bits of jambon cru and local cheese. Throw in the occasional bottle of wine and I too may become one of Johann\u2019s truffle dogs.The strangest news is that there are a particular species of brown fly that infallibly is the best truffle hunter of them all. Let me explain further before your head starts to conjure images of truffle hunters leading small flies on microscopic leashes through the forests of Provence in search of truffles. The fly is known in France with the deceptively clever name, \u2018les mouches \u00e0 truffes\u2019 or truffle flies, who lay eggs over truffle patches and then wait for them to hatch.The well-bred baby flies like to begin their lives with a silver spoon firmly in the mouth and a steady diet of mature truffles. The champagne is optional. If you don\u2019t believe me watch this video from Mirabeau Wines. The problem with flies is that it is a very slow process; good for someone looking for a handful of truffles to add to their omelet, bad for the truffle entrepreneur looking to make a steady living.THE TRUFFLE HUNTJohann, Francois, and Jean-Marc pictured with Eclair and Mirabelle.We walked to a patch of older oaks; Johann pointed out that the ground looked sufficiently burnt with no grass or weeds growing nearby. Experienced truffle hunters know that truffles secrete a chemical which kills plant life vying for the same nutrients. Eclair and Mirabelle ran around for a few seconds, sniffing everywhere until Eclair fixated on a spot and started to dig feverishly. Within seconds he dug a beautiful dirt-caked summer truffle and was rewarded with a precious chunk of ham. A few minutes passed and history repeated itself. So many times in fact that I even crouched down on all fours and started to dig hoping Jean-Marc would toss me a ham piece as well. No such luck \u2014 I would have to wait like everyone else for the promised hors d\u2019oeuvres and bottomless Champagne.TRUFFLES AND CHAMPAGNETartines of salted butter and thick slices of summer truffles.The most learned men have been questioned as to the nature of this tuber, and after two thousand years of argument and discussion their answer is the same as it was on the first day: we do not know. The truffles themselves have been interrogated, and have answered simply: eat us and praise the Lord. \u2014 Alexandre DumasAfter several glorious hours learning about truffles and following Eclair and Mirabelle on a wonderful truffle hunt we headed back to Johann\u2019s beautiful home. He quickly prepared a feast of earthy truffles accompanied by an endless stream of Champagne. I had four maybe five glasses before calling it quits. I still had an hour to drive back home to Fontvieille and face a wife I had to answer to.We feasted on truffles sliced over buttered tartines, truffles sliced over cheese, even scoops of perfectly refreshing truffle ice cream made by a friend of the Pepins. At one point Johann put a mountain of thickly cut truffle slices on three plates, poured two pools of golden olive oil and let us have at it. We dipped bits of freshly baked bread into his farm\u2019s olive oil until the oil dripped profusely from my shiny chin. There may not have been any pigs around the table but you would have never guessed by the snorting sounds we all made.If you are starting to get famished and wish you could partake, I strongly suggest visiting Johann\u2019s online store and getting some truffles and olive oil shipped directly to your door. Johann and Lisa offer an amazing array of gift boxes, oils, truffle beers, wines, and other items to bring back the joyous communal spirit of Provence in your own home.ADOPT A TRUFFLE TREE \u2014 SERIOUSLYOne of the most amazing things they do is allow you to adopt your very own truffle tree. Johann explains: \u2018Anyone can have roots in Provence! Just adopt an olive tree or truffle oak at Les Pastras. You\u2019ll receive an annual shipment of olive oil and/or truffles, the perfect way to begin the New Year, and timed to make a great gift for the holidays. And for every tree purchased, we send a tree to the One Family orphanage in Haiti.\u2019Don\u2019t worry, if your tree ends up a dud, Johann will still send a fragrant box of truffles to enjoy.Francoisp.s. a bit of a disclaimer and a heartfelt endorsement: While all people who grow and hunt truffles are very secretive about their operations I poked a bit of fun at Johann and Lisa. Both are very gracious and wonderful people and I guarantee they will make you feel completely at home at their farm.A visit to Les Pastras is a must-do for any true holiday in Provence.A RECIPE FOR SUMMER TRUFFLES AND PASTA FROM NICESpaghetti with Eggs (Lu Spaghetti a L\u2019Ou)Truffles are a wonderful addition to just about everything. Their earthy flavors marry perfectly with rich, creamy dishes. The pasta recipe comes from disgraced former Nice mayor Jacques Medecin. I may have forgotten the scandals that embroiled his career, but I do remember his wonderful cookbook celebrating Nicoise cuisine. Although this pasta recipe was made with white truffles from Alba, Italy it will work perfectly for both summer truffles and winter truffles.Spaghetti with Eggs (Lu Spaghetti a L\u2019Ou)A Nicoise preparation for spaghetti heavily influenced by her Italian neighbor that I modified slightly from Jacques Medecin\u2019s original.Servings 4Ingredients1 pound spaghetti4 ounces butter room temperature3 eggs3 egg yolks7 ounces Parmesan grated, not shredded1 tablespoon olive oil5 ounces pancetta diced1 pinch piment d\u2019ville (or Espelette)1 cup creamto taste flake sea saltto taste black pepper4 ounces white truffles sliced thinInstructionsCook pasta al dente.While pasta is cooking, beat the eggs, egg yolks, and half of the Parmesan together.Heat the olive oil and brown the diced pancetta. When brown, add the piment d\u2019ville and all the cream.Toss the pasta with the room temperature butter, egg mixture, and pancetta mixture. Shave the truffles over, sprinkle with remaining Parmesan, and serve immediately.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Recipe", "Provence", "Truffle", "Pigs", "Pasta"]}, {"title":

There are several competing frameworks in the Ethereum space these days but Truffle is the market leader and most commonly used so it\u2019s definitely worth keeping an \ud83d\udc40 on what's going on over at Truffle HQ.We have been using Truffle extensively for well over 18 months now, switching from a raw Web3JS library to a full build pipeline favouring features such as testing suite integration, CLI tools, multi-network support and deployment tools to name just a few.We have had some small gripes with Truffle 4 but it has served us well over the last year but with the recent release of Truffle 5 the itch to upgrade was getting to us. We went for it and below are some of the best and worst bits which we found on the path to Truffle 5.Web3JS 1.0 \u2705Truffle now come bundled with the latest Web3JS, this has a host of new additions but the one we love the most is the ability for us to use the PromiEvent construct when dealing with transactions, for example:This is a much more fluent way of handling submission of transactions to the network. Previous all we had was a simple Promise which unfortunately doesn't always fit when there are several states which a transaction can end up in. Previously, we used to use hacks like listening for events and timers checking every X seconds to work around this, the recent changes make it feel right.Async/Await \u2705All Web3 calls are async/await \u2014 either when using them in tests, migrations or a webapp \u2014 this just makes life easier in most scenarios.Additional Network Config \u2705Additional configuration options works well for us, we often price transactions at the lower end as we don't always need them to go through immediately, with the new config we can increase the timeout and block confirmation, for example:This means we can be more confident about running a migration and not worrying about it timing, which did happen with Truffle 4 migrations.Revert Reason Strings \u2705A long overdue addition \u2014 bringing the latest changes to Solidity and Web3 to Truffle. Tests can now validate the failure reason and frontend logic can surface this reason if desired.This has allowed us to tighten up our test and in one occasion find a false positive. Also surfacing some of these reasons to the frontend when needed is a big win for diagnosing potential issues.BigNumber.js to BN.js \ud83d\ude20The change to switch from BigNumber.js to BN.js took us by surprise. The majority of the time it took us to upgrade was going through the thousands of tests we have which utilised BigNumber and convert them to BN.js \u2014 I understand than the inclusion of web3 1.0 forced this move I just wished there was an easier way to do it. I have also found issues with using BN.js with bn-chai with should.js as detailed here.Explicit conversion from ASCII to HEX \ud83d\ude20This seems like an unnecessary change, presumably Truffle knows the method args and signature when making a call so I think the new requirement for explicitly converting to to HEX seems like a unneeded change, ideally it would the the type conversions for me in some way.Function arguments of type bytes must now be converted to hexadecimal bytestrings using web3.utils.asciiToHex().ConclusionTo conclude the latest Truffle 5 release is a vast improvement and should be considered by all those running production ready Truffle deployments. All those involved should be proud of the many thousands of hours and commits which have gone into the release. Above are only some of the new features which we love and we are planning to explore and utilise many more of them in the future.We will continue to use and support Truffle and see a very positive future in it.

Yet, despite being regularly used to deploy smart contracts to test networks, developers are still hesitant to use Truffle for deployments to the Ethereum mainnet. If you feel the same way, hopefully these tips will change your mind.Configure Truffle for the Ethereum mainnetAnytime you are deploying a smart contract to a network, you need an account with some ether to deploy from. After all, we are sending a transaction to create the contract, and a transaction costs money. So to deploy with Truffle, we need to give it access to an account.No one wants the private key or mnemonic of their mainnet account in a config file. Once that file gets committed to a GitHub repo, good luck keeping your ether. For this reason, it is important to use environment variables with your Truffle config.We can add the following code to the top of ./truffle-config.js:const getEnv = env => {  const value = process.env[env];  if (typeof value === 'undefined') {    throw new Error(`${env} has not been set.`);  }  return value;};const mnemonic = getEnv('ETH_WALLET_MNEMONIC');This pulls in the ETH_WALLET_MNEMONIC environment variable and warns us if we forgot to set it.If we want to use Infura to connect to the mainnet, we add the following two environment variables as well:const liveNetwork = getEnv('ETH_LIVE_NETWORK');const liveNetworkId = getEnv('ETH_LIVE_NETWORK_ID');We store the Infura mainnet endpoint in ETH_LIVE_NETWORK and the mainnet network ID in ETH_LIVE_NETWORK_ID.Our networks configuration will then look like this:module.exports = {  networks: {    live: {      provider: () => new HDWalletProvider(mnemonic, liveNetwork),      network_id: liveNetworkId    }  }}Remember to require truffle-hdwallet-provider.With this configuration we can connect to the Ethereum mainnet by running truffle --network live.Set the gas priceTruffle uses an extremely aggressive gas price for its default configuration. This makes contract migrations to the mainnet unnecessarily expensive. Luckily, Truffle has a configuration option to help us.First we edit ./truffle-config.js to get a web3 instance so we can convert from gwei to wei.const Web3 = require(\u201cweb3\u201d);const web3 = new Web3();Then we check https://ethgasstation.info/ to see what a reasonable gas price would be. At the this article was written, a fast transfer would have a gas price of 10 gwei.Now we can configure Truffle to use our reasonable gas price when sending transactions to the mainnet with the gasPrice option.module.exports = {  networks: {    live: {      provider: () => new HDWalletProvider(mnemonic, liveNetwork),      network_id: liveNetworkId,      gasPrice: web3.utils.toWei('10', 'gwei')    }  }}Separate migrations for smart contractsAnother problem developers run into is when a single contract fails in a migration that deploys multiple contracts. When this happens, even if other contracts deployed successfully, none of the deployed addresses are stored in the contract artifacts.This again results in wasted time and money when deploying to the mainnet.To fix this, all we need to do is create a separate migration for every contract we wish to deploy. Only after a migration script finishes will Truffle save the the deployed artifacts. So separate migrations means no wasted time, no wasted money.For example, instead of a single migration for all contracts:./migrations/2_deploy_contracts.jsvar Token = artifacts.require(\"Token\");var Crowdsale = artifacts.require(\"Crowdsale\");module.exports = function(deployer) {  deployer.deploy(Token);  deployer.deploy(Crowdsale);};We use the separate migrations 2_deploy_token.js and 3_deploy_crowdsale.js:./migrations/2_deploy_token.jsvar Token = artifacts.require(\u201cToken\u201d);module.exports = function(deployer) {  deployer.deploy(Token);};./migrations/3_deploy_crowdsale.jsvar Crowdsale = artifacts.require(\u201cCrowdsale\u201d);module.exports = function(deployer) {  deployer.deploy(Crowdsale);};If we need contracts to interact with each other during deployment, we can create another migration where we include multiple contract abstractions and code the interactions.Deploy to the mainnetIf you follow these three pieces of advice, you should have no problem doing mainnet deployments with Truffle.

Sure there is a lot of (un-necessary) hype around AR, and yes there are still many limitations in the technology that pose obstacles to a broader adoption. For example, using mobile device based AR applications, such as games, during a sunny day is not fun at all, and existing AR/VR headsets are way too bulky. Furthermore, the digital objects within AR experiences are often unstable, and quite unrealistic. It seems that the digital reality cannot yet keep up with the complexities of the real one.Despite its current nascence, with so much attention from the big technology players, AR is destined to mature fast. We can already envision a world where the technology integrates tightly with the physical reality, and is simpler to control, and has become a natural part of our everyday lives. The final break through will surely happen only once AR has become fully \u201chands-free\u201d, i.e. it can be easily embedded into wearables like glasses or otherwise seamlessly integrated with the human perception.Persistent digital objects and entities, continuous streams of dynamic real-time information, and a digital reality layered on top of our physical world sound all fascinating. Only time will tell to what extent the technology ends up augmenting our perception of the world.Image now, how many real-world objects could be digitalized and layered on to our surroundings? Paper ads, TVs, traffic lights, pretty much anything static with purpose to simply convey messages or enable banal interactions. Think about the savings that can be achieved, in terms of environmental load and raw materials, if we were able to convert these static objects into a persistent layer of digital information and made easily accessible as needed or required.In a world where digital seamlessly meets physical you might expect to find things such as virtual pets so lifelike and interactive they start replacing domestic animals, and virtual companions with whom the user can interact in a multitude of ways (i.e. Alexa in AR). These types of AI-enabled virtual entities might be there to make peoples\u2019 lives happier or to provide real-time information to the user, for example guidance to assembling something painfully complex as an IKEA chair \ud83d\ude09There is a huge potential in different industry-specific AR applications, e.g.:AR enhanced tourism enabling you to travel anywhere like a local by having the wisdom of the crowd at your hands in every situation. On the other hand, Virtual Reality experiences might actually reduce the desire to travel physically abroad to enjoy for example art and culture.As physical retailing is being devoured by ecommerce, a highly convenient AR experience relates to enabling customers to explore products virtually, and for example try out clothes before purchasing.AR based user interfaces that free us from physical devices like computers, and expand the remit of our interactions with tools, data, and information. We suggest you to take a close look at what Microsoft is doing with its HoloLens, just imagine where the technology will take us in next five years.Though it still seems distant, we are definitely thinking of different ways to prepare for a world where AR is not anymore chained to the user\u2019s mobile phone, and we think you should too.

A lot goes on behind the scenes of a restaurant in order to meet the needs of every customer, while maintaining the sanity of all employees at the same time. Plates shatter, food get overcooked, and sometimes the waitstaff even gets into it a little when it gets a little too hot in the kitchen. But at the end of the day everyone involved works together in order to create another night of happy customers. I have been working in the restaurant industry since I was 15 and have learned many tricks of the trade throughout my time as a waitress. Every afternoon when the staff arrives each person has their own duties to set up for the evening and get ready for service. Coffee is brewed, linens are folded, and tables are set. Being behind it all for so many years, I have learned that there is way more than meets the eye when you head out with your friends for dinner. I hope by the end of this post you will be able to picture what actually happens after you sit down and order your steak frites. An inside look at your local French bistro:Perhaps not the most appealing exterior (located in a Newton suburb strip mall), but the glorious french cuisine and smiling faces await inside this little Parisian bistro!First thing on the list of preparations is to suit up! Here a coworker of mine is pictured sporting her Aquitaine vest. So chic!Next step is to make sure you have all your essentials. Each server notes all the specials for the evening down in his/her receipt book and collects any special instructions for parties from the manager. Wine keys are a must at this Vin Bar.Here is the entire Aquitaine dining hall as seen from the very back of the restaurant. A small, but quaint cafe.This is the main section of the dining hall where the first customers of the night are enjoying their appetizers. Bon Appetit!A popular first course: the Belgian Endive Salad. It is important to note that this salad contains potential allergens, a server must always take precautions or else the customers could get nutty!Next up, the main course! All of your sizzling favorites are being cooked to perfection behind the line in the kitchen. Each server lines up in order to grab and go.Here is one of the best chefs in the biz! Paying careful attention to every parcel for the finished product to look just right.Voila! Les Steak Frites. This lovely close up shows the beautiful texture of each bite. A traditional French dish shared by many at the height of their dining experience and one of my own personal favorites.And last to taste by tonights guests is Aquitaine\u2019s infamous profiteroles. There\u2019s no hiding the deliciousness of these little wonders, even if our talented dessert chef wishes to remain anonymous.When that last costumer leaves (hallelujah) the staff calls it a wrap, puts all the chairs up, and heads out with their hard earned cash.Until next week Aquitaine!\u2014 LivinMarge", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Restaurant", "Cooking", "Waitress"]}, {"title": "Set up private blockchain on Amazon Web Service via geth and truffle suite", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@duyuefeng0708/set-up-private-blockchain-on-amazon-web-service-via-geth-and-truffle-suite-b0023ddaae69?source=search_post", "author_name": "yuefeng Du", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@duyuefeng0708", "publish_date": "2018-09-04", "last_modified_date": "2018-09-06", "readtime": "3.88", "claps": 1, "voters": 1, "content": "Set up private blockchain on Amazon Web Service via geth and truffle suiteyuefeng DuFollowSep 4, 2018 \u00b7 4 min readContentPart I: Create a 2-node Ethereum network with private blockchain, and accounts on the two nodes can send ether to each other.Part II: Deploy a contract from one node, and both accounts can access and execute functions on this contractPart I (establishment of a private blockchain on AWS using geth)Use t2.medium (2 vCPU, 4 GB RAM) with default 8G SSD.Pick Ubuntu OS.Make sure that the two nodes are with the same security group, which allows TCP 30303 (or 30000\u201330999 as I may use more ports on this range).

But don\u2019t forget that black truffle salt is a finishing salt that is intended to be used in a very small quantity. Only a pinch of truffle salt can make your dining experience a magical one!This article aims to answer the question: Why are black truffles so tasty yet so expensive?Cooking with black truffles.Types of truffleTruffles are one of the rarest underground fungi used as a delicacy. This fungi is where the unique flavor of the truffle sea salt comes from.There are two different types of truffle now currently available in the market: white truffles and black truffles from France and Italy, respectively. China also has its own truffles but not quite as tasty as the ones grown in France or in Italy. In fact, the Chinese truffles are considered by some as counterfeit truffles, being sold for as high as $1000 per pound, the same price as black or white truffles but not the same quality. Because black or white truffles are so expensive, thieves are on the lookout for this high price delicacy. Some would even describe truffles as a \u201cdangerous underground black market\u201d because it\u2019s like a very expensive drug like opium or hashish.The Scorzone or the Italian Black Summer truffle is also a quite familiar species of truffles. Scorzone is from where we derived the Italian black truffle sea salt\u2019s amazing flavor. As we have mentioned earlier in this post, truffles are a kind of underground fungi under the taxonomic Ascomycota. The Italian Black Summer truffles are much more in demand compared to the winter variety of truffles. Truffles are often paired with tasty food just like meat, egg and cheese dishes. Truffle sea salt can make almost any type of food taste magical.Why is truffle salt so expensive?Aside from its being a delicacy because of its unique flavor, black truffles are quite expensive because of its habit of naturally growing beneath the soil. They specifically grow in barren places where there is not much plant life flourishing. The absence of plants in these area is attributed to the presence of truffles underground. Another weird fact about truffles is that it\u2019s harvested by the help of trained sniffing dogs that can locate the exact location of these fungi. The farmer will then dig the area that the dogs has identified. Pigs were once used to locate truffles. But the trouble was the pigs tend to eat all the truffles very quickly just before the farmer could harvest it so they replaced the pigs with dogs.So now that you know the reason why it\u2019s so expensive, do not hesitate to other a jar of black truffle salt.

Pero adem\u00e1s recomiendo que instales como IDE el Visual Studio Code por su f\u00e1cil manejo y la posibilidad de poder tener la consola de comandos en la misma ventana.Instalar Truffle:\u00a1Vamos a ello! Lo primero que debemos hacer es instalar truffle usando el gestor de paquetes de Node. Lo hacemos de la siguiente forma:Una vez acabada la instalaci\u00f3n vamos a crear una carpeta en nuestra carpeta personal para iniciar un proyecto de Truffle:$ mkdir ~/smartContracts$ cd ~/smartContracts$ truffle initSi listamos los ficheros y carpetas de nuestra carpeta personal veremos que truffle nos ha creado el esqueleto de lo que ser\u00e1 nuestro proyecto para el Smart Contract. Veremos las siguientes carpetas y ficheros:contracts: aqu\u00ed se almacenar\u00e1n los contratos que creemosmigrations: aqu\u00ed estar\u00e1n los scripts que se ejecutar\u00e1n al hacer migratetest: aqu\u00ed almacenaremos los test para nuestros contratos (en futuras gu\u00edas)truffle-config.js: fichero de configuraci\u00f3n de truffle para Windowstruffle.js: fichero de configuraci\u00f3n de truffle para todos los sistemas menos WindowsPrimer Ejemplo:Con nuestro proyecto truffle iniciado vamos a proceder a crear nuestro primer contrato. Para crear un comando tenemos dos opciones. Podemos hacerlo creando un fichero .sol dentro de nuestra carpeta contracts o podemos ejecutar la siguiente l\u00ednea en nuestra consola de comandos situada en la carpeta ra\u00edz del proyecto:$ truffle create contract HolaMundoRecomiendo hacerlo al principio por consola porque veremos que el contrato que nos crea ya tiene algo de contenido:pragma solidity ^0.4.4;contract HolaMundo {function HolaMundo() { // constructor }}Cosas que nos interesa comentar:La palabra reservada pragma seguida de solidity y su versi\u00f3n indican al compilador que versi\u00f3n de solidity tiene que compilarSe podr\u00eda decir que crear un contrato ser\u00eda similar a crear una clase en POOLos contratos tienen constructores que se ejecutan al desplegar el contrato en la redTeniendo este contrato escrito vamos ahora a compilarlo con los siguientes comandos (la consola siempre apuntando a la carpeta ra\u00edz del proyecto):$ truffle compileEl outuput que nos d\u00e9 ese comando debe ser similar a:Compiling ./contracts/HolaMundo.sol\u2026 Compiling ./contracts/Migrations.sol\u2026 Compilation warnings encountered:./contracts/HolaMundo.sol:5:3: Warning: No visibility specified. Defaulting to \u201cpublic\u201d.function HolaMundo() { ^ (Relevant source part starts here and spans across multiple lines).Writing artifacts to ./build/contractsPor ahora vamos a obviar los Warnings. Si el output ha sido el que os he mostrado veremos que truffle nos ha creado en la ra\u00edz del proyecto una carpeta llamada build. Aqu\u00ed se guardan los fichero que genera la compilaci\u00f3n de nuestros contratos. Veremos que hay dos que se corresponden a nuestros dos contratos en la carpeta contracts: Migrations y HolaMundo. Estos ficheros contienen toda la informaci\u00f3n que necesita truffle para desplegarlos en la blockchain.Para acabar de preparar el despliegue nos falta crear un script en la carpeta migrations donde le vamos a indicar a truffle que es lo que tiene que desplegar. Vamos a crear un fichero con el nombre 2_deploy_contracts.js dentro de la carpeta migrations. En este script le vamos a indicar que contratos queremos desplegar, en este caso solo es uno pero seguro que nos es muy \u00fatil para un futuro pr\u00f3ximo. Escribimos lo siguiente en el fichero que hemos creado:var HolaMundo = artifacts.require(\u201c./HolaMundo.sol\u201d);module.exports = function(deployer) {  deployer.deploy(HolaMundo);};En resumen lo que hacemos en este script es importar el contrato y luego decirle al desplegador (deployer) que ese es el contrato que queremos desplegar. Truffle a partir del nombre ya sabe donde ir a buscar el fichero compilado.Vamos ahora a desplegarlo en la blockchain de test que nos ofrece truffle. Escribimos en la consola:$ truffle developY el output deber\u00eda ser:Truffle Develop started at http://127.0.0.1:9545/ Accounts:(0) 0x627306090abab3a6e1400e9345bc60c78a8bef57(1) 0xf17f52151ebef6c7334fad080c5704d77216b732(2) 0xc5fdf4076b8f3a5357c5e395ab970b5b54098fef(3) 0x821aea9a577a9b44299b9c15c88cf3087f3b5544(4) 0x0d1d4e623d10f9fba5db95830f7d3839406c6af2(5) 0x2932b7a2355d6fecc4b5c0b6bd44cc31df247a2e(6) 0x2191ef87e392377ec08e7c08eb105ef5448eced5(7) 0x0f4f2ac550a1b4e2280d04c21cea7ebd822934b5(8) 0x6330a553fc93768f612722bb8c2ec78ac90b3bbc(9) 0x5aeda56215b167893e80b4fe645ba6d5bab767de Private Keys:(0) c87509a1c067bbde78beb793e6fa76530b6382a4c0241e5e4a9ec0a0f44dc0d3(1) ae6ae8e5ccbfb04590405997ee2d52d2b330726137b875053c36d94e974d162f(2) 0dbbe8e4ae425a6d2687f1a7e3ba17bc98c673636790f1b8ad91193c05875ef1(3) c88b703fb08cbea894b6aeff5a544fb92e78a18e19814cd85da83b71f772aa6c(4) 388c684f0ba1ef5017716adb5d21a053ea8e90277d0868337519f97bede61418(5) 659cbb0e2411a44db63778987b1e22153c086a95eb6b18bdf89de078917abc63(6) 82d052c865f5763aad42add438569276c00d3d88a2d062d36b2bae914d58b8c8(7) aa3680d5d48a8283413f7a108367c7299ca73f553735860a87b08f39395618b7(8) 0f62d96d6675f32685bbdb8ac13cda7c23436f63efbb9d07700d8669ff12b7c4(9) 8d5366123cb560bb606379f90a0bfd4769eecc0557f1b362dcae9012b548b1e5 Mnemonic: candy maple cake sugar pudding cream honey rich smooth crumble sweet treatImportant : This mnemonic was created for you by Truffle.

Adem\u00e1s podemos ver que migrado los contratos Migrations y HolaMundo.\u00a1Genial! \u00a1Hemos desplegado nuestro primer contrato en una blockchain! \u00bfVamos ahora a meterle algo mas de l\u00f3gica al contrato, no?Actualmente nuestro contrato no hace absolutamente nada, as\u00ed que vamos a hacer que por lo menos nos devuelva un saludo cuando lo llamemos. Para esto vamos a ponerle una variable de estado que se cargar\u00e1 cuando se llame al constructor. Lo que ser\u00eda el siguiente c\u00f3digo:pragma solidity ^0.4.19;contract HolaMundo {  string public content;  function HolaMundo() {    content = \u201cHola Mundo!\u201d;  }}N\u00f3tese dos cosas:He cambiado la versi\u00f3n del compilador a la 0.4.19 para estar mas actualizados con la \u00faltima versi\u00f3nHe declarado la variable de estado content como p\u00fablicaUna vez hechos los cambios en el c\u00f3digo del contrato sin salir de la consola de desarrollo de Solidity vamos a ejecutar lo siguiente:truffle(develop)> compiletruffle(develop)> migrate --resetEn esta ocasi\u00f3n hemos utilizado el par\u00e1metro --reset al hacer el migrate porque como hemos seguido con la misma instancia de la red blockchain y ya hab\u00edamos cargado un contrato con el nombre de HolaMundo hab\u00eda que indicarle a truffle que quer\u00edamos vac\u00edar esa instancia del contrato para desplegar la nueva versi\u00f3n.Aclarado eso vamos a llamar a la variable del contrato para ver que contiene. Recordad que Truffle es un framework de JS con lo que las instrucciones en la consola van a ser JS. Vamos a ello:truffle(develop)> var contract = HolaMundo.at(HolaMundo.address)truffle(develop)> contract.content()Aqu\u00ed hemos volcado el contrato en nuestra variable contract. Al tener la instancia del contrato en nuestra variable podemos acceder a sus m\u00e9todos y variables p\u00fablicas. Hay que darse cuenta que al llamar a la variable content hemos indicado los par\u00e9ntesis como una funci\u00f3n. Esto se debe a que cuando declaras una variable p\u00fablica el compilador de Solidity autom\u00e1ticamente te genera una funci\u00f3n para que puedas acceder a su contenido. Lo que ser\u00eda igual a:string public content;function content() {  return content;}Segundo Ejemplo:\u00a1Genial! \u00a1Ya tenemos un contrato que almacena datos en una variable! Ahora vamos a subir un puntito de nada la complejidad y vamos a permitir que el contenido de esa variable sea modificada desde fuera:pragma solidity ^0.4.19;contract HolaMundo {  string public content;  function HolaMundo() {    content = \u201cHola Mundo!\u201d;  }  function setContent(string newContent) {    content = newContent;  }}Una vez este guardado hacemos lo mismo de antes para compilar, migrar y volcar la instancia del contrato sobre nuestra variable.

Tambi\u00e9n vemos al volver a acceder a la variable que efectivamente nos ha cambiado su contendido.Tercer Ejemplo:\u00a1Vamos ahora a por el tercer y \u00faltimo ejemplo! En este ya que sabemos acceder y modificar el estado de variables vamos a usar el tipo de dato mapping para permitir que cada usuario que llame al contrato pueda almacenar el contenido que desee. Para eso vamos a modificar nuestro contrato:pragma solidity ^0.4.19;contract HolaMundo {  mapping(address => string) public saludos;  function setSaludo(string newContent) public {    saludos[msg.sender] = newContent;  }  function getSaludo() public view returns (string) {    return saludos[msg.sender];  }}Resaltar que para saber quien est\u00e1 llamando al contrato usamos la propiedad msg.sender que es un dato que se env\u00eda en cada llamada. Nos permite saber la cuenta que est\u00e1 llamando al contrato.Vamos ahora a volver a desplegar el contrato compilandolo antes y volcando luego la instancia en una variable. Y ahora vamos a empezar a almacenar nuestros datos desde las distintas cuentas que nos da Truffle para luego acceder a la variable desde cada una para ver su contenido:truffle(develop)> contract.setSaludo(\u201cHola cuenta por defecto!\u201d)truffle(develop)> contract.setSaludo(\u201cHola cuenta del indice 4\u201d, {from: web3.eth.accounts[4]})Truffle como es un entorno de pruebas nos permite sobrescribir las propiedades del objeto msg que hemos comentado antes. De esta forma en la segunda linea pod\u00e9is ver que utilizo el array de cuentas que nos ha creado al arrancar la consola para acceder a la cuenta del \u00edndice del array 4 y as\u00ed reemplazar el sender al llamar el contrato. Podemos ver que efectivamente cada cuenta ha almacenado sus propio contenido en la variable de la siguiente manera.truffle(develop)> contract.getSaludo() \u2018Hola cuenta por defecto!\u2019truffle(develop)> contract.getSaludo({from: web3.eth.accounts[4]}) \u2018Hola cuenta del indice 4\u2019Efectivamente vemos que cada cuenta que ha llamado al contrato ha almacenado un saludo distinto.Hasta aqu\u00ed esta peque\u00f1a gu\u00eda sobre desarrollo de Solidity con Truffle.

I recommend using Ganache, which you install by running npm install -g ganache-cli.Next let\u2019s make sure we have our ganache running in the background. Open your terminal and run the command ganache-cli. That's all! It runs on port 8545by default, just like most Ethereum RPCs, and so does Truffle.Also note that when ganachefirst starts, it prints out a list of accounts that will be pre-funded with ether, along with a twelve-word seed phrase for re-generating those accounts. You can use this seed phrase to initialize your MetaMask client with the same accounts, and you\u2019ll have lots of Ether when you start! (Ether is used to pay for network usage, or gas, on the Ethereum network)If you wanted to start up ganachewith the accounts you already have in MetaMask, you can tell ganachewhat seed phrase to use with the -m flag. For example:$ ganache-cli -m \"concert load couple harbor equip island argue ramp clarify fence smart topic\"Setting up a simple Truffle DappNext, let\u2019s generate a basic Truffle dapp. The default result of truffle initis a simple example currency.To get it up and running, run these commands:mkdir metacoin# Create a folder for your new dappcd metacoin# Move into that foldertruffle init # Initialize a default truffle project in that foldertruffle compilertruffle migrate # Build, compile, & deploy the dapptruffle test test/metacoin.jsSetting up MetamaskIf you visit it, you\u2019ll see that by default this new Dapp template signs you in with the first account on your ganache-cli account list, which happens to be the same account that got pre-populated with 10k shiny new Metacoins! That's because when you ran truffle migrate, Truffle used your first account as the contract publisher, and the contract says to fund the creator's account with 10k coins.You can now send those coins to any account you want, for example, the second account in your ganache-cli list! If you enter an address and a value, and hit send, you'll see your balance go down!If that seems a little too easy, I\u2019d agree with you! That\u2019s why Metamask gives the user an opportunity to approve every transaction that a Dapp attempts, and that\u2019s more secure!Let\u2019s try connecting to the same account through Metamask, and see how easy it is!Setting up MetamaskNow you\u2019ll want to install Metamask from the Chrome store.Please see how to install MetamaskOpen MetamaskClick the current network name in the top right.Select Custom RPCSet the current RPCLocalhost:8545address.5. fill in the second account (0x035b9094158fc6af051242b6c04444c017b7e17c) and amount of 36. You will see the the result of transaction.This has been a simple example, but hopefully shows how Truffle and Metamask work together. They are able to pretty much work out of the box! That\u2019s because Truffle helps you write web3-compliant dapps. Web3 is a Javascript API declared by the core Ethereum team, and Metamask injects it directly into the Dapp\u2019s context!", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Beginner", "Metamask", "Ganache"]}, {"title": "Leek and Potato Soup with Truffle Oil [vegetarian]", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@simondweiner/leek-and-potato-soup-with-truffle-oil-vegetarian-fe94afc1d52e?source=search_post", "author_name": "Simon Weiner CGMA", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@simondweiner", "publish_date": "2016-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2016-02-25", "readtime": "1.54", "claps": 1, "voters": 1, "content": "Leek and Potato Soup with Truffle Oil [vegetarian]Simon Weiner CGMAFollowFeb 2, 2016 \u00b7 2 min readAlthough Leek and Potato Soup might be a classic in some countries, in Poland (or at least in the area I live) it is unknown. A few years ago we went to Italy for our skiing holiday. We reached our destination after two days of driving but since it was too early to go to our hotel, we found a busy, family type restaurant for lunch. And that was the place where I tried this soup for the first time.Leek and Potato Soup is already delicious by itself but truffle oil really moves it up to quite another level. Although the below recipe obviously is not exactly the same as at that restaurant, the soup is as lovely as the one I had a few years ago. I have made it so many times since then and it is always greatly appreciated by everyone. It is important though to have a really high quality truffle oil: the one with truffle\u2019s pieces rather than one with just its aroma.INGREDIENTS (for 4\u20136 portions):450g potatoes, peeled and cut into 2\u20133cm cubes,450g white parts of leeks, sliced,850\u20131000ml vegetable stock (it can be made with this concentrated stock paste),Melt the butter in a medium size pot.Add the potatoes, leek and onions, season and then stir well to coat in the butter.Scrape the sides of the pan with a spoon so all the vegetables are on the bottom, put a disc of grease-proof paper on top of them and cover the pot with a lid.Decrease the heat to medium low and cook for 10 minutes.Remove the paper, pour in 850ml of stock, bring to boil and cook for approx. 5 minutes or until the potatoes are soft.Liquidize the soup in batches and transfer to a cleaned pot.Add the milk, adjust the seasoning and bring to boil again. If the soup is too thick, add more of the stock.Serve the soup in bowls, drizzled with the truffle oil.Based on BBC Good Food recipeOriginally published at www.tastesofhealth.eu on February 2, 2016.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Food", "Recipe", "Vegetarian"]}, {"title": "Chef Maurice and a Spot of Truffle (Chef Maurice Mysteries #1) by J.A.

Connection between truffle test framework and the dev node works. Need to revisit this again to get the drizzle app working.If you have a recent pixelbook, and you are trying to get set up for smart contract development, then this post may be helpful. Here are my notes on this setup.Turn on Linux ContainersIn settings on your pixelbook, turn on \u201cLinux (Beta)\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s at the bottom of the page. Reddit reference:index - CrostiniReddit gives you the best of the internet in one place. Get a constantly updating feed of breaking news, fun stories\u2026www.reddit.comThat should create a virt running a Debian Linux container that has access to a chromium window, which presents as a terminal application.Crostini gave my container a ton of resources, which is awesome. Modding the resource allocation of new virts and containers is way out of scope for this post, but you would need to learn about Crosh (Ctrl-Alt-t), vmc, lxc and lxd. There are some clues here, here, and here.Configure your container:At this point, you will want to copy and paste from the web into your terminal. Fortunately, crostini set up clipboard support for you\u2014 you can copy as usual from the web and two-finger click on the trackpad to paste into the terminal.Here is a gist containing all of the config I needed to get to step 3 in the truffle drizzle tutorial.Access a local truffle node with Metamask:The quickest way to develop smart contracts these days is to use truffle and a local eth node of some kind. The easiest dev-node to use is probably ganache, which simulates a local ethereum chain.You will want to run metamask in chrome, and make sure it works well with other Dapps on mainnet or a testnet before you try to use it to access a local Dapp. That\u2019s out of scope for this post, but get metamask running on a public net first.Once you have metamask working, you will need to run a local blockchain, fire up a dapp example with truffle against ganache, and connect to your running example.The hard bit will be finding an IP/Port combination that metamask will actually be able to connect to. I\u2019ll try to post a step by step walkthrough later, but here\u2019s the TL;DR:Get a truffle example running on your crostini virt using ganache.2. On your virt, find your IPV4 addy with ```ip address```3. Now run ganache on that IP rather than the default localhost, (keeping port 8545):ganache-cli -b 3 -p 8545 -h 100.115.92.1984. Copy the passphrase words metamask uses as a passphrase5. In metamask, logout, log back in by importing the accounts with the passphrase words you just copied, and connect to a custom rpc network with your virts IP and port: http://100.115.92.198:85456. Configure truffle.js and truffle-config.js for the IP and port that you configured metamask for. Now everything has a consistent config.7. Running ```truffle test``` should successfully run the tests in your example app.Those are the key bits. Now you have both metamask and the test infrastructure running. You can write smart contracts, run tests against them with the truffle test infrastructure, and make changes to accounts with metamask.The front end is still going to need some magic that I will add later.Other notes:When you get your dapp running for the first time with npm run start, it will fire up on a weird URL that the virt assigns it \u2014 something like: http://penguin.linux.test:3000/That will get you to the point where you are asked to log in with metamask, but you can\u2019t connect metamask to that URL \u2014 chrome OS and your dns providers, etc. will get in your way.Metamask will spin forever if it can\u2019t connect. Connect to mainnet to reset the state and then connect to the custom rpc network. Be sure to log out of metamask and re-import with the passphrase your ethereum dev node provides each time you restart your dev node.I checked out a few resources while figuring this step out:There is a crostini discord channel: https://discord.gg/abpfxACSome more info on accessing your virt that could come in handy:MetaMask and Access Ethereum Private Chain from other PC in the same network (for test)This answer is just a complementary to the answer provided by @Achala Dissanayake, and I'd like to thank him, again!

Hence, TDD sometimes also called Test-First Development.3 thumb rules of TDDYou are not allowed to write any production code unless it is to make a failing unit test pass. Meaning you should first test case before any production code and that test should fail.You are not allowed to write any more of a unit test that is sufficient to fail, and compilation failures are failures. Meaning you should stop writing any further test case if your test case fail. So the moment your test case fails, you should stop writing the more test case, and start working on production code. And also, even if compiling of test case fails, stop wrting more test cases.You are not allowed to write any more production code than is sufficient to pass the one failing a unit test.How to perform TDD TestAdd a test.Run all tests and see if any new test fails.Write some code.Run tests and Refactor code.RepeatTruffle comes with built in Mocha test framework and Chai assertion library.Flow diagramThe image is taken from google.Steps to follow to start using TDD in TruffleIn truffle console :> create test BallotAdd this code   ----------------------------------------------------------  const Ballot =  artifacts.require(\"./Ballot.sol\");  contract('Ballot', function(accounts) {      let BallotInst;      let chairman = accounts[0];      before(\"getting instance before all Test Cases\", async function(){          BallotInst = await Ballot.new();      });      //First test case to test chairman is set or not.      it('chairman is assigned', async function(){          assert.equal(await BallotInst.chairman(), chairman, 'Test Failed. chairman is not assigned.');      })  });  ---------------------------------------------------------> test ./test/ballot.jsIt will fail since we haven't written code.> create contract BallotIt will create a contract under contract folder.> create migration deploy_contractsIt will create a migration file under migrations folder.Now add code in Ballot.sol  ------------------------------------------------------  pragma solidity ^0.4.4;  contract Ballot {      address public chairman;      //constructor      function Ballot() public{          chairman = msg.sender;      }  }  ------------------------------------------------> test ./test/ballot.jsNow your test case will pass.Keep adding test cases first and then contract codes...Ballot test and contract fileshttps://github.com/Vishwas1/tdd_truffle_bc/blob/master/test/ballot.js https://github.com/Vishwas1/tdd_truffle_bc/blob/master/contracts/Ballot.solTest OutputSummary:Test driven development is a process of modifying code in order to pass a test designed previously.It more emphasis on production code rather than test case design.It is sometimes known as \u201cTest First Development.\u201dTDD includes refactoring a code i.e. changing/adding some amount of code to the existing code without affecting the behavior of the code.TDD when used, the code becomes clearer and simple to understand.Few use full linkshttps://drive.google.com/file/d/18B5xorMOd6AYDxGVlGBYH7uR7y_ZHJPx/view?usp=sharinghttps://www.codeproject.com/Articles/683498/DTDT https://michalzalecki.com/ethereum-test-driven-introduction-to-solidity/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkblc5WRn-UHere is my Github repo", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Test Driven Development", "Truffle", "Solidity", "Technology"]}, {"title": "", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@agoramarketplaceurl2014/how-to-find-darknet-marketplaces-895968ffdc03?source=search_post", "author_name": "Jerry Truffle", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@agoramarketplaceurl2014", "publish_date": "2014-09-18", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-14", "readtime": "2.45", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "Jerry TruffleFollowSep 18, 2014 \u00b7 3 min readHow To Find Darknet MarketplacesThe online black markets are underground in nature and finding these black market sites like the Agora Marketplace URL was difficult since you needed to use specific, complex, and long Tor browser URLs directly to the browser. This entire process was very difficult and if the websites of these online black markets change its address then navigating these sites became even more difficult. But now you can find black market sites like Agora Market easily with the help of Grams which is a search engine for darknet. It has been launched in beta and you can easily find all the online black markets. You can also find any illegal contraband or drugs online using Grams search engine very quickly.There are many people who may face difficultly in accessing black market sites like the Agora Marketplace URL. But when you use Grams, you will find that black markets are becoming less and less black and it also enables you to access these sites easier. It can also be called as the Google-styled search engine that has been created for the dark web. But you can only use Grams through Tor which is an anonymous browser. The reason for this is because of the nature of service that is offered by Grams. Thus you can easily find online black market sites like the Agora Marketplace URL with Grams and for this you simply have to type the name just like you do in Google. With the deep web search engine, you can buy drugs, guns, and other illicit items as it is considered as the most comprehensive way of finding all the illegal things.Grams search engine has been crawling results from the eight different black markets which includes Agora Marketplace, BlackBank, C9, Mr. Nice Guy, Evolution, SilkRoad 2.0, The Pirate Market, and Pandora. It has also been contacting more website owners so that it can be able to index their websites on Grams search engine. It is the best way in which you can navigate the websites that are difficult to access. It can be done while anonymizing Tor browser.To access the Agora Market paste this address into your Tor Browser http://agorahooawayyfoe.onion.Grams search engine is useful for those people who are looking for ways to purchase different things from darknet\u2019s black market sites like the Agora Marketplace URL. It is known to provide top search engine results according to its relevance. You can also restrict the search for only certain markets and you can also sort the market by date and price. Grams search engine also keep track of the latest exchange rate of bitcoins which is the semi-anonymous digital currency that is used in majority of the darknet markets. It also updates the exchange rate of bitcoins every five minutes. Thus with the help of this search engine, the dark web have become a little less dark and you can easily find illicit drugs and other items online from the Agora Marketplace URL and other websites.",

So without any further ado, let me tell you more about what\u2019s been cooking in the development space.Languages, Tools and Libraries updatesEtherlime 1.1.0Resources: https://medium.com/limechain/etherlime-spring-updates-7f924f1a605eThe Etherlime team has released a new version, full with major improvements and integrations. Here is list of the things included in this release:etherlime coverageDue to the ineffective way solcover is measuring and calculating the coverage of smart contracts, a lot of developers were having troubles and inaccuracies when using the etherlime coverage. Etherlime coverage is now completely remade and is integrated with the 0x coverage tool. All the things you expect from it, cool coverage report and html version, are now available when running the etherlime command.etherlime zkEtherlime has integrated with the iden3 snarkjs library in order to support the efforts developing zk apps. Through the etherlime cli one can initialise etherlime project with zk inited and start compiling and generating circuits. After circuits one can generate proofs, verifier scripts and smart contracts and deploy them on the network.etherlime flattenerEtherlime now has a flattener command \u2014 etherlime flatten . Through its use, etherlime can now generate you a flattened file with your contracts and dependancies.etherlime ideIntegrated Development Environment comes with etherlime out of the box. You can now easily get into coding smart contracts by opening their project through etherlime ide.vyper compilerVyper is growing more and more popular as an Ethereum smart contract language. Etherlime now supports a compilation of vyper smart contracts. You just need to run a docker demon and name your vyper files with .vy and you are good to go!react shapeA new shape for React was created and allows you to start your dapp projects with this popular framework.Truffle 5.0.11Resource: https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/releases/tag/v5.0.11Version 5.0.11 of Truffle is here. Most of the improvements concern the debugger with improved program counter and an optimisation of the lookup of variables. Block number and block timestamps are added to the migrations output information.Quroum 2.2.3Resource: https://github.com/jpmorganchase/quorum/releases/tag/2.2.2https://github.com/jpmorganchase/quorum/releases/tag/v2.2.3Quroum has released a new version of their node \u2014 2.2.3. The major enhancements include updating the geth node, improved downloading and synchronisation times and added configuration for transaction limit sizes in the genesis blocks.Web3js \u2014 1.0.0 beta 52Resource: https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta.52Similar to the previous releases of web3js, this release predominantly contains bugfixes. In terms of enhancements, the getAccounts method will now check for unlocked local accounts and use them before asking the node for accounts.Slither 0.6.2Resource: https://github.com/crytic/slither/releases/tag/0.6.2The static analysis tool Slither, that we\u2019ve talked a couple of weeks ago about, has released a new version - 0.6.2.Major improvement points are the updated support for embark and the improved detector for upgradeability contracts.VSCode SolDoc PluginResource: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=NicoVergauwen.soldocA new helpful plugin has been developed for the VSCode IDE users. The plugin is called SolDoc and can be used to easily generate solidity description comments complying with the ethereum natspec.Knowledge sharingWhy you should use ethers.js VideoResource: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkUjsZ7Rz2MWonderful short video overview of ethers.js has been made \u201cby what the func?\u201d.

And to make working with Ethereum smart-contracts easy, a development environment called Truffle Suite was built. In this truffle ethereum tutorial, we will look at the following topics:What is Truffle Suite?Features of Truffle EthereumWhat is MetaMask?Installing Truffle and creating a Truffle project on UbuntuInstalling MetaMask on Google ChromeInstalling TestRPC on UbuntuDemo: Developing a simple DApp with truffle and MetaMask and making a transactionWhat Is Truffle Suite?Truffle Suite is a development environment based on Ethereum Blockchain, used to develop DApps (Distributed Applications). Truffle is a one-stop solution for building DApps: Compiling Contracts, Deploying Contracts, Injecting it into a web app, Creating front-end for DApps and Testing.Truffle Suite has three components:Truffle: It is a Development Environment, Testing Framework and Asset pipeline for Ethereum BlokchainsGanache: Ganache is a personal Ethereum Blockchain used to test smart contracts where you can deploy contracts, develop applications, run tests and perform other tasks without any costDrizzle: Drizzle is a collection of libraries used to create easy and better front-end for Ethereum DAppsFeatures Of Truffle EthereumHere\u2019s a list of features that makes Truffle a powerful tool to build Ethereum based DApps:Built-in support to Compile, Deploy and Link smart contractsAutomated Contract testingSupports Console apps as well as Web appsNetwork Management and Package ManagementTruffle console to directly communicate with smart contractsSupports tight integrationWhat Is MetaMask?MetaMask is an easy-to-use browser plugin (for Google-Chrome, Firefox and Brave browser), that provides a graphical user interface to make Ethereum transactions. It allows you to run Ethereum DApps on your browser without running a full Ethereum node on your system. Basically, MetaMask acts as a bridge between Ethereum Blockchain and the browser. MetaMask is open-source and provides the following exciting features:You can change the code of MetaMask to make it what you want it to beProvides built-in coin purchasingLocal-key StorageNow, that we know about Truffle and MetaMask, let\u2019s get to the hands-on part of how to use these for DApps.Installing Truffle and Creating a Truffle Project on UbuntuIn this section of Truffle Ethereum tutorial, we will see how to install Truffle and how to create a Truffle project.To install Truffle, you will have to run a simple command as below:$ npm install -g truffleNow, let\u2019s get to creating a project in Truffle. First, let us create a new directory and get into that directory using the following command:$ mkdir truffle-pro $ cd truffle-proTo create a project, execute the following command:$ truffle unbox metacoinWhen this command is successfully executed, you will see a project structure present in that directory with minimal files necessary for a project.That\u2019s it! You have created a simple Truffle Ethereum project.Installing MetaMask On Google ChromeIn this section of Truffle Ethereum tutorial, we will look at how to install MetaMask plugin for Google-Chrome browser.Here are the steps to install MetaMask browser plugin:First go to the following link: https://metamask.io/Click on \u201cGET CHROME EXTENSION\u201d button. This will open a new tab3. Click on the \u201cAdd to Chrome\u201d button and then \u201cAdd Extension\u201c.4. Now, on the Top-right corner of your browser, you can see the MetaMask icon.5. Accept the Terms and Conditions.And Bam! MetaMask is installed.Now that we have Truffle Ethereum and MetaMask installed in the system, let\u2019s see how we can develop a DApp using Truffle Ethereum and make transactions using MetaMask.Installing TestRPC On UbuntuFor this Truffle Ethereum tutorial, we will use \u201cTestRPC\u201d, which is a Blockchain emulator, to develop our DApp. TestRPC allows you to run a network for testing. It allows you to make calls to the Blockchain without running an actual Ethereum node.To install TestRPC, run the following command:$ npm install -g ethereumjs-testrpcDemo: Developing A Simple DApp With Truffle And MetaMask And Making A TransactionOpen a new terminal and run TestRPC with the following command. This will start a test network on your system.$ testrpcYou will see a list of available accounts, private keys for these accounts, a mnemonic phrase, and the port on which TestRPC is listening.Note: Do not use the mnemonic phrase on the main Ethereum Network. Use it only on a private network.Now, let\u2019s setup truffle.Open a new terminal and go into the directory where the project was created.To run truffle on our network, we need to edit the \u201ctruffle.js\u201d file. Open this file and make the following entries:module.exports = {      networks: {            development: {                  host: 'localhost',                  port: 8545,                  network_id: '*' //* will match to any network id                  }         }};Save the file and exit.Now, we will have to compile the contract and migrate it to the network. The commands to do this is as follows:$ truffle compile $ truffle migrateYou can see that the code was successfully migrated and deployed on the network.Now, open Chrome browser and click on the MetaMask icon. Click on \u201cImport Existing DEN\u201c. Enter the mnemonic phrase displayed when you executed the \u201ctestrpc\u201d command, enter the password and click \u201cOk\u201c.By default, MetaMask runs on the main network. We don\u2019t want to spend money just for a demo, right? For that reason, we have to change network to a private network. In our case, this network is Localhost 8545.We can now see an account with 99+ ethers in it. \u201cWOW! Free ethers!\u201d Well, to disappoint you, these are not real ethers. These are test ethers provided only for testing purpose and has got no real-world value.We need two accounts to make a transaction: a sender and a receiver. So, let\u2019s create a new account. To do this, in the MetaMask plugin, click on \u201cSwitch accounts\u201d and then click \u201cCreate Account\u201c. Your new account is created.Now, to send ethers to this account, we need to copy the address of this account.For this Truffle Ethereum tutorial, we will send ethers from Account 1 to Account 2. So, let us switch the account back to Account 1. Here, click on \u201cSEND\u201c, enter the address to which you want to send the account (the address of Account 2 that I copied) and the number of ethers to be sent and click \u201cNEXT\u201c.It will show you a summary of the transaction and ask for confirmation. Click \u201cSUBMIT\u201d and the transaction is done.We can see now that there are 50 ethers less in Account 1.To verify the transaction, switch to Account 2. Here, there are 50 ethers more. This shows that 50 ethers were transferred from Account 1 to Account 2.Congratulations! You have created your first Truffle Ethereum DApp and made a transaction. I hope this truffle ethereum tutorial blog was informative and helped you understanding about Truffle.

Many patterns roam the web nowadays and some may be broken if you try to use them directly just by simply updating the syntax.During my process of learning Test-Driven Development for Solidity I came across an important one \u2014 the ThrowProxy. This pattern has its roots in the GoF Proxy design pattern, and is a very clever trick to avoid the cumbersome call function through a contract\u2019s ABI. It is thoroughly explained by Karen Scarbrough in this article, which I recommend reading if you are new to Solidity. At some point in the latest versions of Solidity v0.4 the clever proxy contract got broken, because a revert is issued somewhere along the way. This only happens if your signature is not void , but if you are testing modifiers then it obviously won\u2019t be (simply adding the returns declaration will also throw the revert ). The reason for this is not obvious, but there is a github issue tracking it and hopefully there will be some answers.So, how do we work around it?The most common suggestion is to wrap your contract calls using functions with void signatures. This is not a beautiful solution but serves perfectly for most of the common uses. I forked Karen\u2019s example, updated it to Solidity v0.5 and moved the require to a modifier.Then, to test the contract using the ThrowProxy just add a wrapper with void function signatures. I also added sanity checks for the variable value, and updated the syntax for the ThrowProxy contract.And voila!, we have a working ThrowProxy for Solidity v0.5. You can download or clone the full repository from github (note that truffle.js is setup to run with ganache-cli default configuration)rmlopes/Simple-Solidity-Require-TestA simple example of testing require() in Truffle using Solidity tests. - rmlopes/Simple-Solidity-Require-Testgithub.comThis approach has some caveats, for instance if you are testing calls from different contracts, or need to initialize an owner for a contract using the migrated contract through DeployedAddresses.sol it may not work.The light at the end of the tunnelThe good news is that using Solidity\u2019s call function is not as cumbersome as it used to be. This is now facilitated by the helper abi.encodeWithSignature , such that where previously you had to write something like x.call(bytes4(keccak256(\"f(uint256)\"),a,b)) , now you can now use it more transparently through x.call(abi.encodeWithSignature(\"f(uint256)\",a,b)) . Another advantage in Solidity v0.5 is that now thecall family of functions return a tuple (bool success, bytes memory data) , where the data contains the message that was sent in the corresponding require or revert that triggered the failure. The boolean will be true if the transaction goes through, or false if it is reverted.I\u2019ve put together another simple example using this method, that you can download or clone from github. Then, use truffle and ganache-cli to run the example and play with the tests.rmlopes/solidity-require-testsSimple test for modifiers using require statements in Solidity (> 0.5.0) - rmlopes/solidity-require-testsgithub.comThanks for reading.

This setup leads on from my earlier article on how to build a and test a contract in Truffle using Javascript https://medium.com/@paulmarriott/a-very-basic-truffle-js-testing-story-6dfb7a504fe8The docs give an example using an example Metacoin contract. My goal was to use an VERY simple basic contract and recreate the same example.The working folder structure and code is shown below. I also cover some common pitfalls on the way that were both frustrating and hugely time consuming.My goal is to boost your productivity, if you something out of the article then my job is done.Firstly the setup of files looks like this:The contract used was basic, only a set and a get function were used. This was intentional, the idea was to build and understand test automation in truffle.pragma solidity ^0.4.18;contract MetaCoin { uint x;  function set (uint y) public { x = y; }  function get () constant public returns(uint) { return x; }}contract basicsum { uint x;  function set (uint y) public { x = y; }  function get () constant public returns(uint) { return x; }}Next step was to ensure that the Truffle commands worked, these are shown below.Executing the command migrate should successfully execute with now errors.Getting to this point should be possible with the standard truffle docs and online tutorials.Now we are ready to build a solidity test script.Goto the test directory in the truffle project and create a new file called \u2018TestBasicsum.sol\u2019. Add the code below to this file.pragma solidity ^0.4.18;import \u201ctruffle/Assert.sol\u201d;import \u201ctruffle/DeployedAddresses.sol\u201d;import \u201c../contracts/basicsum.sol\u201d;// The name of the contract and the actual name of the file MUST be the same!contract TestBasicsum {function testbasicsumget() public {  basicsum meta = new basicsum();  uint expected = 0;Assert.equal(meta.get(), expected, \u201cValue expected should be zero\u201d);  } }The pragma command is not essential but good practice. The two import statements that follow link to contract files that should have already been installed by truffle. A search of the operating system should reveal that they exist on the workstation. I found that these two commands worked as expected. I thought I had to manually create these files and put them in the contracts directory. This was an error and resulted in out of gas errors each time I tried.The import statement import \u201c../contracts/basicsum.sol\u201d is a link to the contract file we wish to test. This file must exist and must be in the contracts directory. This was my first mistake.The contract name TestBasicsum on the line that follows and the name of the file TestBasicsum.sol MUST match. If they do not then when truffle runs the test errors like the screen shot below will show. This was the biggest lesson learnt and only learnt through trial and error. I found the answer when I took the truffle example on the website and kept trying different code and filename combinations to replicate the same issue.This took me an entire day to find the issue\u2026.Google does not always know the answer :-(Only one contract in this file will be executed, each function within the contract will be executed in the order in which they are listed. This is an important distinction from other Solidity contracts and something worth knowing before truffle test development is started.The function testbasicsumget() is like other examples, very simple. It first creates a new instance of the basicsum contract and executes the get method of the contract.The very last line is an Assert.equal statement that compares the result of the call to the expected value. This statement is possible ONLY with the Assert library, there is a standard assert function in regular Solidity but this is lower case and does not support the same methods as the Assert (first letter uppercase) library.To execute the test first re-run truffle compile, truffle develop and migrate. From the truffle window now run truffle ./test/TestBasicsum.solIf all went well the output should be displayed as follows.NOTE: Another issue found during testing was that the name of the contract file needed to match the name of at least one contract in the file. For example my contract basicsum has a filename of basicsum.sol. If I where to change the name of the contract file to mycontract.sol BUT did not have a contract in the file with the same name then the solidity test would fail. The error returned would state.Could not find nnn.sol from any sources; imported from\u2026.nnn.sol", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Ethereum Testing", "Solidity", "Truffle"]}, {"title": "Truffle Mac", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@MiyokosKitchen/truffle-mac-d65250289d19?source=search_post", "author_name": "Miyoko's Kitchen", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@MiyokosKitchen", "publish_date": "2015-07-22", "last_modified_date": "2018-03-21", "readtime": "1.53", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "Truffle MacMiyoko's KitchenFollowJul 22, 2015 \u00b7 2 min readImage by MiyokosKitchen.comEveryone\u2019s favorite comfort food can now be made in minutes using our Aged English Sharp Farmhouse.

As far as I\u2018ve learned from online reading, talking to proprietors, and emailing producers and distributors, most mezcal is produced by the low-thousands (?) of small-scale producers in Mexico and most is produced in the traditional manner. It hasn\u2019t yet been massively commercialized and the production process industrialized like so many of the world\u2019s spirits.The traditional process involves the following, as summarized on Wikipedia: The process begins by harvesting the plants, which can weigh 40 kg each, extracting the pi\u00f1a, or heart, by cutting off the plant\u2019s leaves and roots. The pi\u00f1as are then cooked for about three days, often in pit ovens, which are earthen mounds over pits of hot rocks. This underground roasting gives mezcal its intense and distinctive smoky flavor. They are then crushed and mashed (traditionally by a stone wheel turned by a horse) and then left to ferment in large vats or barrels with water added.A horse pulls a heavy stone wheel in a circle to crush roasted agave hearts. (Photo By Agave \u2014 Own work, CC BY-SA 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=4905781)One distributor told me that horses and mules are most commonly used in Oaxaca to crush the agave and that in Puebla mechanical shredding (which doesn\u2019t involve animals) is most common.There is also a type of mezcal called mezcal de pechuga, a type which incorporates raw meat into the distillation process.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Mezcal", "Animal Use"]}, {"title": "Building Decentralised Link Shortner on Ethereum blockchain using Truffle", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@anilkumarmaurya/building-decentralised-link-shortner-on-ethereum-blockchain-using-truffle-8fc120438891?source=search_post", "author_name": "Anil Kumar Maurya", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@anilkumarmaurya", "publish_date": "2019-07-17", "last_modified_date": "2019-07-17", "readtime": "3.57", "claps": 5, "voters": 1, "content": "Building Decentralised Link Shortner on Ethereum blockchain using TruffleAnil Kumar MauryaFollowJul 17 \u00b7 4 min readhttps://anilmaurya.github.io/link-shortner/Blockchain is emerging technology, it needs no introduction.

Invite your friends for this Carpathian Truffle & Mushroom Macchiato and they will talk even months later about this creamy soup.Only a few people know that truffles can be found in the Carpathian Mountains. I am really lucky. We have just to leave our house in Buzau Valley to find fresh truffles in the nearby forests. Even better: \u201cPongo\u201d will do the job, our truffle dog. Buzau County is an ideal place for truffle hunting. Being on the same latitude as Piedmont in Italy, having favorable climate conditions and abundant forests, Buzau County has excellent conditions for truffles.But you can buy fresh Carpathian truffles also at Obor Market in Bucharest or in some specialized fine food shops. Try this Truffle & Mushroom Macchiato because it will be creamier than your morning coffee. Here we go:Ingredients500 g chanterelle mushrooms200 g dried boletus2 onions200 g sweet cream100 g butter 85%one fresh trufflesaltpepperegg whiteHow to prepare itClean the chanterelle mushrooms with a brush and cut. Put dry boletus mushrooms in a bowl, then add hot water to rehydrate them. Cut the onions julienne and fry in butter over medium heat. Add the chanterelle and boletus mushrooms and fry. The water in which the boletus mushrooms were rehydrated must be added when all the mushrooms have a brown color. Allow to boil over medium heat. Add water if necessary. The cream soup should remain quite thick. Let it boil for 10\u201315 minutes.Pull off the heat and blend until creamy. Add heavy cream, salt and pepper.Cut the truffle into thin slices. Add to the soup then blend again.Beat one egg white at bain-marie until it becomes shiny and retains its shape.Place the cream soup in a cup, add a tablespoon of egg white on top and drizzle with truffle oil and a slice of the truffle.Serve hot with croutons or toasted bread slices.My advice: If you want a very fine cream soup, before serving you must put all through a sieve. In this case you will lose a part of the amount cooked.For extra flavor, you can produce the truffle oil yourself, adding slices of fresh truffle in sunflower oil that you can keep in the refrigerator and use in many other dishes (pasta, sauces, meat and vegetable stew, etc).Cook with pleasure!

Dick & I worked together at the same law firm in the early 1980s and he reminded me that he was the first person outside of family to see Laura when she was born 35 years ago as he visited me in the hospital shortly after she was born. We have remained friends through his moves to San Diego and Texas.While they were here, we scheduled a truffle hunt, as fall is the season for truffles. We had a choice between searching for white truffles (rarer and costlier) or black truffles. We settled on the black truffles because hunting for white truffles required us to have boots, water proof clothes and other serious gear, which none of us considered bringing to Italy. (Most likely, living in San Antonio and Southern California, none of us even own such gear.)Our Sienese landlady, Francesca, came along as interpreter for the truffle guide who did not speak English. Gary decided not to come at the last minute because he had been sick, so Dick, Victoria, Francesca and I set off to meet our truffle hunter-guide, named Francesco.We drove to a forested area outside of Siena and began hiking through the woods and shortly the dogs, two Lagotto Romangnolo dogs, an Italian breed often used for hunting truffles, were let loose.People think pigs are used for hunting truffles and perhaps in some Eastern European countries they still are. But pigs were outlawed for truffle hunting years ago in Italy because they cause severe damage to the environment. I read that pigs can detect truffles 3 meters deep and will start digging; dogs usually can detect only to a depth of slightly more than a meter and tend not to eat vegetation on the forest floor as pigs might.However, the dogs will eat the truffles if you are not quick enough to get them first. We left that to Francesco. Whenever the dogs started digging or signaled, they found something (and there were false alarms) he would run to them and try to get the truffle before they did. At times he snatched truffles right out of their mouths.We were in a beautiful and calm cypress forest. We got to keep the truffles that were found and in the space of a couple hours we each ended up with about four or five truffles.We had arranged for Francesca\u2019s chef-husband, Francesco, to prepare a truffle lunch for us in our apartment after the hunt; he used his truffles, not ours. Laura and her friend Emily were here at the time, so they joined us for lunch. We had bruschetta with a truffle spread, cheese with truffle honey, pasta with truffle sauce, eggs with truffles and a truffle dessert. All accompanied by good wine, of course.Dick and Victoria were leaving for home two days after the hunt and they stowed their truffles in their checked baggage and used them when they returned home.I used ours to make truffle risotto \u2014 bury the truffle in a jar with risotto for two or three days and then cook the risotto and grate or slice the truffle in it. I also made pasta with truffle sauce, eggs with truffles and we generally grated our truffles on anything we could find as they only keep for about 10 days (wrapped in a paper towel and sealed in a jar in the refrigerator. A truffle shop has opened in the old city, selling black and white truffles, truffle honey, truffle spreads and a wide variety of truffle products. We are headed there today.Wine TastingOur daughter Laura and her college roommate, Emily were here on November 1, Laura\u2019s 35th birthday. We arranged a wine-tasting tour of the Chianti region as a birthday gift.I am no wine expert; I know what I like when I taste it. Nonetheless, I will try to relate what I remember from our tours, although I may not have remembered everything correctly. Chianti wine here is not like the cheap stuff we tend to buy and drink in the United States. Top-quality Chianti must meet strict requirements and is identified by the black rooster on the wine bottle. That rooster means the grapes are 100 per cent Sangiovese grapes grown south of Florence and north of Siena, the Chianti region. It also means the grapes were grown without irrigation, only rain water, and were hand-, not machine-picked. If there is not a black rooster on the label, but a regional notation \u2014 D.O.C.G. \u2014 that means that the grapes are at least 85 per cent Sangiovese and the wine can still be called Chianti. We were told that the so-called \u201cTuscan reds\u201d are blends developed for American tastes as Americans are not accustomed to the tastes of the pure Chiantis.We visited two wineries. One was a newer winery \u2014 the facility was only three years old, although the winemaker has been making wines longer. It is a modern facility very similar to wineries we see along the central coast in California. We toured the winery and sampled five or six wines along with very generous bruschetta and salumi plates. When our guide, Erica, learned it was Laura\u2019s birthday, she brought out a sparkling wine for us to toast Laura.We enjoyed the wines here and bought six bottles, intending to use three while here and bring three home. Unfortunately, we drank all of them before we could get them home.We then toured a much different winery \u2014 located in an old castle that has been in the same family since the middle ages. We toured the castle, including the dungeon. We walked through the vineyards and learned that botanists from either the University of Perugia or Bologna (I cannot remember which) had discovered ancient indigenous varieties of grapes in some of the Tuscan hillsides and they were working with this winery to propagate and grow them again.Our wine tasting here was accompanied by lunch and Francesca had arranged for a birthday cake for Laura. Laura and Emily bought wine to take home (not sure if their wine made it home) and we also bought new olive oil, hand creams and soaps made from the castle olives.Near the end of our stay, our niece Casey and her husband Travis came to visit us in Siena \u2014 a stopover on their honeymoon in Italy. They wanted a day of touring in Tuscany and we agreed to drive. They decided they wanted to see San Gimignano. Before we set off Travis was looking at wineries and found one just outside San Gimignano, so we agreed to stop there for tasting.After some misdirection from our GPS, we arrived at the Tenuta Torciano winery. It was a beautiful setting. We walked into the tasting room/restaurant and were warmly greeted by Chiara and her cousin, whose name escapes me. We had a very brief tour of the grounds and one of the aging rooms, and Casey said, \u201cI think I have been here before.\u201d She pulled up some photos on her phone and found a picture of Elizabeth in the aging room where we stood. She and Elizabeth took a trip to France and Italy several years ago and had taken a wine tasting tour from Florence \u2014 and it was to the Tenuta Torciano winery. Both the girls had told us several times that the best meal they had in Italy had been at the winery they visited. So, we decided to stay for lunch.When we returned to the tasting room, four wines and a salumi plate were waiting for us and we began our tasting. As I looked at the signs and labels with the winery name, I began to think it seemed familiar. Then I remembered that Stephen had brought the name of a winery that someone had recommended he visit when he was here, but we never got there. I had kept the piece of paper he had written the winery name on, and sure enough it was Tenuta Torciano. Chiara is part of the 15th generation of her family growing and producing wine on this property. We tasted eight different wines and had a lunch of the grandmother\u2019s lasagna with white truffle oil drizzled on top. We tasted 30-year-old balsamic vinegar and new olive oil. Chiara was an amazing wine teacher, and this was undoubtedly the best wine tasting experience I have ever had. WE were there nearly four hours and walked out satisfied and sated. We all bought wine, oil and aged balsamic.We did finally make it to San Gimignano, where we had espresso and gelato from a world champion gelato maker and walked some of the narrow streets of the town before heading home to Siena. We are so grateful to Travis for suggesting this adventure and appreciate that they chose to spend part of their honeymoon with us.Olive OilHave any of you watched the Netflix series Fat, Salt, Acid, Heat? The episode on fat talks about olive oil from Tuscany. Fall is olive season and it is when you get \u201cnuovo olio\u201d \u2014 new oil, freshly pressed.The grocery stores are selling new oil in five- and ten-liter jugs, but we decided we wanted to buy from the farmer. Francesca, who seems to know all things, took us with her when she went to the farm where she buys her nuovo olio each year. Franco, the producer, presses his olives himself and bottles the oil; he ships all over the world. We saw boxes packed and ready to go out to the United States, Japan, Germany.Olives to be pressed for oil must be picked when green, before they turn black. We were told that December used to be the month for picking and pressing, but due to climate change, they are now picked mostly in November.The village near Franco\u2019s farm has a community press where small growers can bring their olives to press into oil. Franco used to bring his olives there to press. There can be a long wait and he would usually wait until late at night, when the last person was done, and then clean the press himself before pressing his olives and taking his oil back home to bottle. However, he now has his own press and does everything on his farm.We tasted two different oils \u2014 drank them straight out of a cup \u2014 and swooned. We settled on one; we bought two five-liter cans and plan to pack them in our suitcases for the trip home. Franco instructed us to store the oil in a cool, dark place and that once we opened a can, we needed to store it in a glass bottle, preferably green. I am thinking of our garage and my large iced tea dispenser used for parties.We purchased one bottle to use while here and Franco gave us a small bottle of his other oil as a gift. We only regret that we did not purchase more to ship home.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Travel", "Italy", "Tuscany", "Retirement", "Travel Writing"]}, {"title": "Upgrading to truffle 3 from an existing truffle 2 project", "post_link": "https://medium.com/hello-sugoi/upgrading-to-truffle-3-from-an-existing-truffle-2-project-c0f030b681d3?source=search_post", "author_name": "Angello Pozo", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@angellopozo", "publish_date": "2017-02-14", "last_modified_date": "2017-10-25", "readtime": "1.69", "claps": 1, "voters": 1, "content": "Upgrading to truffle 3 from an existing truffle 2 projectAngello PozoFollowFeb 14, 2017 \u00b7 2 min readI created a fork of react-redux-starter-kit and added web3 and truffle to the mix. Recently truffle was upgraded to version 3, and broke the flow. Which is cool because now its nicer to work with. It no longer renders a .js file, but rather creates a json file and they updated the configuration file. Follow along and see how I updated the previous repo to use truffle 3.Updating the configuration fileThe rpc key was removed and a new key networks houses all possible environments. To add a staging or local target, simply create a new object. Looking at the older truffle.js file, this was an easy update.In src/store/web3Reducer.js I require truffle.js and use a few keys. I only had to update the path of keys to the node.Updating truffle-solidity-loaderThe current master branch on truffle-solidity-loader does not have my pull request from my branch. But thats ok, npm allows for direct linking into a github repo! I modified the following in package.json.I kept the old api, but given the changes in truffle we need to tell Webpack which network to attach to. When we import or require in a solidity file, it will return a json object. Therefore, we need to json-loader. Webpack will apply loaders right to left, thats why json-loader is first.As an FYI, if you upgrade to Webpack 2, you can can provide an object instead of query params.Using the new Json filesThe changes allow us to import solidity files and get back a json object. Working with the new interface is as follows:Given how I was structured, I was required to make some changes. I had to update the chain of promises.I incorporate the promisified deployed method and added it to the chain. This forced me to create a few state variables.ConclusionOverall upgrading to truffle 3 was relatively easy. I referenced truffle.js in a file, and so had to change a few keys. Then I had to update any file that included a .sol file. Integrating with truffle-solidity-loader, I could include it and pass the object into truffle-contract.

If you have a small farm or lifestyle acreage and would like to grow a food crop on your land, you might be interested in growing a few truffle trees. But is your soil suitable? What about your climate?Even if you have bigger plans and would like to establish a large truffiere, you might be wondering about what you would need to do to provide the optimal growing environment for production.Soil health: Success from the ground upSuccess begins in the soil and truffles appear to have quite complex soil requirements. Before you start, it\u2019s important to plan your soil preparation, site layout, and how you will integrate other farm activities to maintain soil integrity.Is your soil suitable?Truffles need free-draining, alkaline soil. While soil pH can be adjusted, soil type is not so easy to change. Sandy loams and clay loams are the best option, with between 10% and 30% clay.Heavy clay soils are unsuitable as they don\u2019t provide enough drainage, while sandy soils are also unsuitable because they don\u2019t hold enough water and drain too quickly.Many of Eastern Australia\u2019s soils are too sandy or they consist of heavy clay. Getting an accurate picture of your soil type over the entire planting area is critical for success.The NSW Department of Primary Industries offers a handy tool called the Soil Health Card that you can download and use to self-assess the soil on your property. It is not intended to replace a professional soil test but it will give you a better idea of your soil type and health.Preparing your siteTruffles need free-draining soil. This means that before you plant your trees, you should consider ripping the soil, especially if it has been compacted through previous agricultural use or is hard and dry.Quercus ilex, commonly grown in Eastern Australia for truffle production. Image Source: WikimediaEven if you only plant a few trees, the soil still needs to be worked deeply to allow moisture and nutrient penetration.After your trees are planted, you should aim to minimize the use of heavy equipment around the root zone. It is crucial to keep the soil structure intact as truffles need open, fluffy soil for good drainage.Getting a soil testImage Source: soil-net.comThe Department of Primary Industries conducts soil testing, as do several other privately owned laboratories. Their horticulture-specific test measures soil pH, electrical conductivity (associated with soil salinity), phosphorus, sulfur, cation exchange capacity, organic carbon, chloride, nitrogen, boron and other micronutrients such as iron and magnesium.A more detailed test can also detect deficiencies or toxicity in your soil due to an imbalance of nutrients.You can order soil test kits online along with instructions on how to collect your samples.Adjusting the pHBags of lime await the spreader. Photo \u00a9 Richard Webb (cc-by-sa/2.0)Many of eastern Australia\u2019s soils are acidic, with typical pH ranges from 4.5 to 6.5. Truffles require an alkaline soil with a pH range between 7 and 8. It\u2019s important to ensure that you test the subsoil pH (10\u201330 cm below the surface) as well as the topsoil (0\u201310 cm).The most cost-effective acidity treatments over large areas are lime or dolomite. The application rate will be determined by several factors including soil type and pH.Your local department of agriculture or agronomist can give you specific advice for your soil. It is worth the extra cost to ensure that you give your trees the best start possible. As all too many growers know, truffle-growing is a fickle business and success is far from guaranteed.Identifying your soil typeThere is a simple way to determine your soil type: you make a mudshake!You need:A clean glass jar with a lid (the jar should have straight sides)A soil sample from the site you are testing (it\u2019s best to take the sample from 20\u201330 cm below the surface)\u00bd a teaspoon of laundry detergentMethod:Lay your soil out flat to dryRemove any sticks, stones and debrisCrush any lumps so that you are left with fine soil matterPlace 10 cm of soil in the bottom of the jarFill the jar \u2154 full of water and add the detergentShake vigorously, then set it in a safe place and leave itOver the next few days, the soil will settle into layers of sand, silt and clay, with sand at the bottom and clay at the top. Clay will cloud the water for days.Measure the depth of the layers. This will tell you the percentage of silt, clay and sand in your soil. For example, if your layers are 2.5 cm sand, 2.5 cm silt and 5 cm clay, then your soil is 25% sand, 25% silt and 50% clay.What type of soil is it?Image source: WikimediaHow to interpret the Soil Texture TriangleAfter you have determined the sand percentage in your sample, locate that number on the bottom of the triangle. At each number, you can see two lines, one that goes to the right and one that goes to the left. Hold a ruler, pencil or finger along the line that goes left.On the right side of the triangle, find the number that represents the silt in your sample. Follow the diagonal line attached to that number.Find the point where the two lines intersect. Follow the line from the intersection point to the left side of the triangle. It should arrive at the same percentage of clay as your soil sample.The line that goes to the left of the intersection point will lead you to the soil texture of your sample. For example, a soil that is 20% sand and 30% silt is a sandy clay, while a soil that is 50% sand and 40% silt is a sandy loam.If you would like to know more about what you can or can\u2019t do with your soil type, visit the Soil Quality website for lots of in-depth soil information and resources.Other UsesWill your truffiere be used for other purposes? Some growers choose to grow short-term crops in between the rows while their trees are small, but if you do this, it\u2019s important to choose plants that have similar water and nutrient requirements to your trees. You need to maintain the ecosystem that is best suited to truffle formation. You also need to consider the impact that other uses might have on the soil.Growing truffles in Eastern Australia: Temperature and climate mapsFor a detailed look at temperature and climate regions of Australia, check out the Diggers Climate Map.Image Source: Bureau of Meteorology, Australian Government; (Lee, 2008).Get your soil right, taste successTruffle growers will all tell you that there is no exact science to producing a truffle crop. Many would-be growers have spent considerable sums of money on establishing a truffiere only to meet with disappointment. Like many horticultural enterprises, there are significant risks of failure.However, the right soil is a critical factor in truffle production. If the soil is unsuitable for some reason, you can be sure that your truffle crop will be poor or non-existent. By exploring some of the options here, you can help to set yourself up for success.Be thorough in your testing and soil preparation. Seek professional advice and be prepared to follow it; do everything you can to give your enterprise the best chance of flourishing. Growing truffles in eastern Australia is possible, and for the diligent and well-prepared, the rewards can be enormous.Truffle FAQsWhat type of fungi are truffles?Truffles are ectomycorrhizal fungi, meaning they live on or near tree roots. The part we eat is the fruiting body of the ascomycete fungus, which grows underground and relies on its aroma to attract fungivores (animals that eat fungi) to consume its fruit and spread the spores.Where do you find truffles in Australia?Many people have asked the question, do truffles grow in Australia? They have traditionally been a European crop, after all.The answer is that Australia produces some of the highest quality truffles in the world. The most commonly grown variety is the French Black or Perigord truffle (tuber melanosporum). They grow in cool climates in eastern Australia, in Tasmania and in some parts of Western Australia.What kind of trees do truffles grow under?Truffle trees in Australia are usually oak (Quercus robur and Q. ilex) and hazelnut trees (Corylus avellana). Before being planted out, seedlings are treated with truffle inoculant that contains spores from mature truffles. This gives the truffles a competitive edge over other fungi that might also colonize the roots.Growing truffles without trees: Is it possible?Truffles are totally dependent on the host trees and cannot exist without them. The tree provides the products of photosynthesis (sugars and carbohydrates) to the mycorrhizal fungus that produces truffles.In return, the fungus passes minerals and water to the tree. Other fungi can perform the same function for the tree, so competition from other fungal species is a serious threat to production.What climate do truffles grow in?Truffles need hot summers and cold winters. The mean daily summer temperature should be around 20\u2103 while the mean daily winter temperature should be around 5 \u2103. Many growers consider reliable frosts to be essential, although some have had success in areas where there is little frost. Success with growing truffles in Eastern Australia means choosing the right climate as well as the right soil.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Horticulture", "Truffle", "Soil Health", "Soil Testing", "Black Truffles"]}, {"title": "Truffle served in a Holy Graal: Graal and Truffle for polyglot language interpretation on the JVM", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@neomatrix369/truffle-served-in-a-holy-graal-graal-and-truffle-for-polyglot-language-interpretation-on-the-jvm-d33f0d96b78?source=search_post", "author_name": "Mani Sarkar", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@neomatrix369", "publish_date": "2017-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2018-03-26", "readtime": "2.28", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "Truffle served in a Holy Graal: Graal and Truffle for polyglot language interpretation on the JVMMani SarkarFollowDec 7, 2017 \u00b7 3 min readReblogging from ZeroTurnaround\u2019s Rebellabs blog siteOne of the most fascinating additions to Java 9 is the JVMCI: Java-Level JVM Compiler Interface, a Java based compiler interface which allows us to plug in a dynamic compiler into the JVM. One of the main inspirations for including it into Java 9 was due to project Graal \u2014 a dynamic state-of-the-art compiler written in Java.In this post we look at the reasons Graal is such a fascinating project, its advantages, what are the general code optimization ideas, some performance comparisons, and why would you even bother with tinkering with a new compiler.Like everyone else we were inspired by the vJUG session by Chris Seaton on Graal \u2014 it looks like a great tool and technology and so we decided to play with the technology and share it with the community.\u2026you can read the rest at ZeroTurnaround\u2019s Rebellabs blogsIn case, you are wondering what some of the ASCII-art images in one of the paragraphs is about, here\u2019s a bit of explanation, hopefully it will clear up any doubts.How does it actually work?A typical flow would look like this:AST \u2192 Abstract Syntax Tree (explicit data structures in memory)We all know that a JIT is embedded inside HotSpot or the JVM. It\u2019s old, complicated, written in C++ and assembly and is fairly hard to understand. It is a black box and there is no way to hook or link into the JIT. All the JVM languages have to go through the same route:(ASM = assembly)The flow or route when dealing with traditional compilers and VM would be:But with Graal, we get the below route or flow:(notice Graal skips the steps that create byte-code by directly generating platform specific machine code)Graal basically helps moving the control-flow from Code to the JIT bypassing the JVM (HotSpot, in our case).I hope you enjoyed the read, please feel free to share any constructive feedback, so we can improve the material for the community as a whole.

The tools for blockchain developmentTo visualise this better, you might want to download ganache. It\u2019s a tool to visualize blockchain; made to test and debug Ethereum-based Distributed Application (DAPP).Primary Concept of Blockchain as portrayed in https://idevji.com/what-is-blockchain-technology/You already know the concept of how blockchain records hash of previous blocks to maintain data integrity. Now let\u2019s find out how blocks are form and even before that happens.Visualization of different network topologyThere\u2019s no \u201cde jure\u201d rules on how each node are connected after one node is registered to the network. Just like in classic networking\u2019s \u201cMesh Topology\u201d. As the visualized on the left, Mesh are state where nodes are connected dynamically and non-hierarchically.Accounts vs Nodes vs Contracts vs Blocks vs TransactionsBefore going into the lifecycle, it\u2019s better to understand the building blocks of the blockchain.Accounts are, like in Bank, a collection of transaction records each entity (person, company etc) haveNodes are devices who subscribed into the network. It works as both storage and Accounts. Nodes and contracts are not dependant one-to-another.Contracts are like classes in OOP. Defined in *.sol files. Accounts can invoke any functions in any Contracts available. It stores variable which is shared/synchronized within the network. Any modification to any of this variable will be recorded as a Transaction within a Block, broadcasted to all nodes.Blocks are record of a function call. It can have multiple Transaction.Transactions are record of variable change within and/or across account.LifecycleSolidity on Truffle is a very simple Programming Language. I am (and maybe you all are too) a web/mobile programmer and works with client/server architecture. I was wrong to start learning DAPP by assuming that I need to work on how to sync it to the network and any other validations, You don\u2019t need to code anything to do this. Assume each of the variables, arrays etc in the *.sol files are shared within the network. Any process in the lifecycle below happened autonomously; this is a high level language.A. Append \u2018transaction object\u2019 and ValidationAs mentioned above, each change to any part of variables are regarded as transaction. In solidity, these transaction are in shape of raw object{    nonce: 1,    gasPrice: 1000000000,    gasLimit: 140000,    to: '0x633296baebc20f33ac2e1c1b105d7cd1f6a0718b', // address    value: 0.005,    data: '0xcc9ab24952616d6100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000' // data block in HEX format};B.

Nicholas D\u2019Andrea @gnidan over at Truffle University. Nicholas is a developer at Truffle Suite who primarily works on Truffle\u2019s core tools.When it comes to developing decentralized applications, Truffle Suite is the standard of choice. Truffle development framework provides you with:Truffle: development environmentGanache: a personal, configurable development blockchain that you can run locally; also provided with its own GUIDrizzle: a set of front-end libraries to help synchronize your contract data, layered on top of a Redux storeIn this post, I attempt to dive into the internals of the development environment, so some previous experience with truffle technology or smart contract development is desirable. Like many other projects in the blockchain space, Truffle is open-source. Therefore, I reference the Truffle git repository frequently, so I suggest you follow along.If you are not familiar with the Truffle Suite, I recommend starting here.With that out of the way, let\u2019s jump right into it.Truffle DesignTruffle was built with the command/workflow-first approach in mind. Truffle is command-oriented: truffle init, truffle compile, etc. Project's code is structured in a way where everything fits into a command with commonalities across them.Another commonality is in contract abstractions, which is handled by the truffle-contract package. These abstractions help facilitate contract interaction. One frequently used function that\u2019s provided by contract abstraction is ContractName.deployed().The abstractions are fueled by artifacts which are persistent JSON files that get stored in the /build directory of your project when you run truffle compile. The abstractions use these files to give you the helper function for contract interaction.Let\u2019s take a look at the different packages.truffleThe truffle package brings everything together. It contains a config \u2014 a module bundler for Javascript files. This package also includes some integration test.truffle-coreThis package is the main entry point for Truffle. It all starts with cli.js. This file sets up the \u2018command\u2019 infrastructure, processes the user arguments, and then subsequently runs the command you specified. It also handles error handling and makes sure that the program exits gracefully.The command argument fetches the proper command from ./lib/commands directory. This directory is where all the commands are defined. So for example, if you run truffle compile, it runs compile.js located in this directory. Each command defines its own options/flags that you can specify when you run the command (e.g. truffle compile --all). Also, each command defines its run(options, done) method which gets invoked in the previously mentioned cli.js. The options argument includes the options you defined in truffle.config (e.g., if you specified Solidity compiler in the config file, it makes its way to this options object). If you have an empty configuration file, Truffle falls back to the default configuration values. It also takes a callback function done which gets invoked when we are done processing this run function. All of the commands use this mechanism and expect a callback.truffle-configIn index.js of this package, we can see the default values defined for configuration. It also defines a detect() method where it tries to load the user-specified configuration file. It merges it with default configuration values in such a way that user-specified values take precedence and overwrite the default values.truffle-contractTruffle-contract is a smart contract abstraction that allows you to interact with your contract. Essentially, it is a wrapper around web3js. It\u2019s initialized with helper functions, e.q. you can call myContract.deployed() to get the deployed instance of the contract or myContract.someFunc() to call a specific contract method. These translate to JSON RPC requests. Based on the ABI passed to it, it differentiates between a read and a write on the blockchain, i.e., between a transaction and a call.If you send a transaction to the blockchain, the abstraction also waits for this transaction to get mined and keeps waiting for a number of blocks defined by timeoutBlocks. Few other parameters are also available to specify how you want the Truffle process to listen for results of transactions you posted. Truffle-contract also provides revert reason string in case of a reverted transaction. Under the hood, it has to resend the same transaction as a call (a read). Transactions modify the blockchain but do not provide any return values. A call on the same function simulates what would happen in a transaction but discard the state changes when done. They are a local invocation on the node you are connected to and don't get broadcasted. They also do not consume any Ether.The helper functions use promises and therefore can be used with Javascript\u2019s async/await syntax.Note: myContract.deployed() only works if you are using Truffle's migration system to deploy your contracts.truffle-contract-schemaThis package defines the underlining format of the artifacts. The formal spec can is located in the /spec folder. This schema underpins JSON files that get generated in /build folder when truffle compile command is executed. Currently, there is no simple way to get artifacts for external contracts into your Truffle project unless you take the external smart contract source code and compile it yourself to get an artifact. The only required property for an artifact is the ABI and you are able to interact with the contract. However, you also need to specify the network and address property of the artifact to interact with the intended instance of the contract. Simply building the artifact from the source code doesn't give you that. Either way - it's a clunky process at the moment. The upcoming tool from the Truffle Suite titled Truffle DB is intended to be a replacement/enhancement for the artifacts.truffle-workflow-compileThis package handles the compilation. It gets invoked when you run the truffle compile command, but the compilation is also performed as part of truffle migrate and truffle test commands. Inside the index.js we can see that it does two things.First, it grabs all the smart contract source files and compiles them - Truffle supports different compilers which you can specify: Solidity, Vyper or run arbitrary external commands. Second, it collects the compiled results and passes them to the Artifactor.When it comes to artifacts, there are two sides to it, the Resolver and the Artifactor.truffle-artifactorThe Artifactor takes these abstractions, converts them into artifacts and writes it onto the disk (abstraction and artifact have the same format, except that abstraction has helper functions). Before saving it, the Artifactor examines the already existing artifacts for the same contract on your disk that you might have previously created. If it finds any, it merges them with the new ones, so that the new build does not unexpectedly break something. E.g., the newly created artifact and the already existing one might have different networks defined. Fields like abi and whatever changed in your smart contract source get overwritten.truffle-resolverWe can see the Resolver in the following example:const contractName = artifact.require(\"ContractName\");Every time you use this syntax (e.g., during testing or deployment), artifact is an instance of Resolver. The Resolver can pull from npm, epm or disk. Inside the package, we can see different Javascript files that handle these different sources. They all get plugged-in together in index.js where the require() function looks for the import path of the artifact in these various sources. This artifact is then used to make a contract abstraction. The Resolver also attaches a web3 provider & network to the generated contract abstraction.truffle-compileThis package specifies the source of your compiler in /compilerSupplier and is directed at Solidity compilers exclusively. Truffle uses solc.js by default rather than native binaries for the compilation. Solc.js offers greater portability, but it\u2019s slower when it comes to compilation. Also, managing native binaries for different Solidity versions can become cumbersome, so using docker images comes as a great alternate option.truffle-migrateWhen you run truffle-init two files are created, the Migrations.sol smart contract and the initial migration file 1_initial_migration.js. The initial migration deploys the Migration contract to the specified network. The subsequent migrations deal with the details of the deployment of the smart contracts you create. After each migration, it records it to on-chain by sending a transaction to the Migrations contract that you initially deployed and updates the last_completed_migration. This is evident in migration.js where migrations.setCompleted() function is called right after the migration.Migrations help automate and manage the deployment of new software versions and aren\u2019t exclusive to Truffle.truffle-deployerWe can see the syntax deployer uses in migration files:deployer.deploy(ContractName);The deployer uses promises, and it chains actions together. It queues up the deployment and keeps track of every operation, effectively making a recipe for Truffle migrate to follow. The deployer indicates all the operations in the migration scripts, e.g. deployer.deploy() or deployer.link(). Truffle migrate takes these instructions from the deployer and executes them in the order provided.truffle-testTruffle test does not have its package. It is located under truffle-core package under /lib/test.js. The tests hook up everything to Mocha, both for Solidity tests as well as Javascript tests. The testing environment compiles and deploys your contracts to a test network (for Solidity tests, it also deploys test contracts you created), sets up testing wallet accounts and provides other setup needed for the testing environment such as extending test timeouts. It also defines the contract() function that you have certainly seen if you wrote Javascript tests in your Truffle projects:contract(\"MyContract\", () => {  it(\"asserts some statement\", async() => { ... } }The contract() function is the biggest differentiator from Mocha.Truffle test also runs Ganache in the background for you as a testing network (if no testing network is specified). Another thing that the testing framework provides is the ability to roll back the state after running each test file \u2014 Ganache itself provides this feature as it\u2019s able to take a snapshot of its state, and then revert to it after the test is performed. This allows for a \u201cclean-room environment\u201d and ensures that your test files do not share state.SummaryThe Truffle team is enabling the growth and adoption of Dapp development by making it easier for developers to jump into the ecosystem.

Things we need installed are testrpc, and truffle. Once we have Truffle 3 installed we can create a project folder and then run truffle init inside of our new folder. This will setup a truffle.js file for us as well as provide us with some default contracts and migrations.In order to start up our truffle console we need to first run our testrpc server by running the testrpc command in our terminal. Great, now lets write a HelloWorld contract and play around with it! Inside our contracts folder, lets create a new file called HelloWorld.sol. At the top of our file we need to specify which version of Solidity we are using by adding pragma solidity ^0.4.4;. One important thing about writing Solidity code, semi colons are not optional!Now we can create a contract. Inside of our contract we will create a constructor function to give our contract a balance, and then we will create a Deposit function that will allow our contract to accept deposits and an increase to its balance. Our final contract will look like this.contract HelloWorld {    uint public balance;    function HelloWorld() {      balance = 1000;    }        function Deposit(uint _value) returns(uint _newValue) {       balance += _value;       return balance;    }}Typical Truffle workflow at this point is to truffle compile and then truffle migrate our contracts. We will need to go into our _deploy_contracts migration and comment out (or delete) the default deployments we are using, as well as add a deploy for our HelloWorld contract. Our new migration file will look like this\u2026var ConvertLib = artifacts.require(\"./ConvertLib.sol\");var MetaCoin = artifacts.require(\"./MetaCoin.sol\");var HelloWorld = artifacts.require(\"./HelloWorld.sol\");module.exports = function(deployer) {  // deployer.deploy(ConvertLib);  // deployer.link(ConvertLib, MetaCoin);  // deployer.deploy(MetaCoin);  deployer.deploy(HelloWorld); // new code };One thing about Ethereum development that I\u2019ve already noticed is that things change frequently, and drastically. After some stack overflow research, I found what seems to be the current way to handle calls and transactions in Truffle 3.We can declare our deployed contract as a variable like var helloWorld = HelloWorld.deployed(), then to query our balance, in our truffle console we can this line of code\u2026helloWorld.then(a => console.log(a.contract.balance())).then(console.log)To make a deposit from one of our test accounts we can run this line of code\u2026helloWorld.then(instance => instance.Deposit.call(500).then(balance => console.log(balance)Now you should see that the balance of your contract has increased from 1000 to 1500!Alright, now you should have a nice little set of tools to begin working with Ethereum and Solidity.

But how do these trends impact us as consumers? We\u2019ve narrowed down the top 5 trends in our opinion.1. Empathic Artificial IntelligenceArtificial Intelligence (AI) is a burning hot topic that just keeps getting hotter every passing day. Analysts from Gartner have predicted that within the next few years, almost every new software will have some form of AI embedded inside.2019 is likely to be a big year (again) for AI. We can expect better personalized experiences, increased relevance and recommendations of content within your mobile applications. As consumers are demanding personalized services and treatment, consumer-facing AI solutions are likely to get more humanized features and be able to better understand human emotions and the context. In practice this means AI detecting human emotions more accurately and reliably from facial expressions and speech using deep leaning and neural network algorithms, and reacting to those with tailored response. As AI begins to understand us better, AI assistants, chatbots and customer service robots will become more useful, and more human-like.2. Smart homes and other intelligent digital environmentsThe research and advisory company Gartner describes smart space as a \u201cphysical or digital environment in which humans and technology-enabled systems interact in increasingly open, connected, coordinated and intelligent ecosystems\u201d. An example of such a space is a smart city \u2014 where data is collected from different sensors and devices and utilized to provide digital services for the citizens and optimize efficiency of the city operations such as traffic, public transportation, waste management and other infrastructure activities. One of the successful live examples of a smart city is Singapore where smart solutions bring convenience for the everyday lives of people: most of the governmental services are available digitally and more and more services via mobile, extensive real-time traffic and transportation data is publicly available, and wide sensor platform enhances the safety and helps improving the city operations. There is a growing trend in new initiatives as IDC expects the global smart city investments nearly double from the expected $81 billion in 2018 to $158 billion in 2022.Another smart space, much closer to the heart of consumers is the smart home. As the global household penetration of smart homes, including networked devices such as Amazon\u2019s Alexa home assistant and integrated smart heating and security systems and related services, will be 9.5% in 2019 and is expected to reach 22.1% by 2023, an entire ecosystem of applications and services will begin to change the way we interact with technology in our homes. Soon it will become mainstream to control the temperature of the room, dim the lights and even open and close the curtains all with a simple voice command.In 2019, many of us will choose to purchase smart home appliances and integrated home automation systems because of the increased convenience those gadgets bring.3. Automation in our everyday livesInvention of the ATM in 1960s started a digital self-service era automating the process of certain monetary transactions like the depositing and withdrawing of cash making the task easier and quicker for us \u2014 and for the bank \u2014 to focus our time on other activities. From that time, automation has come a long way.In 2019, automation is expected to be more prevalent in our lives than before. According to Gartner, there are five types of autonomous objects: robotics, vehicles, drones, appliances and agents. As robots, drones and driverless cars have already begun to gain traction in the technology field with several pilot projects around the world, and the implementation of chatbots in e-commerce and voice assistants like Amazon\u2019s Alexa and Apple\u2019s Siri have started to become mainstream popular in 2018, we can only expect many more use cases to serve us in our daily lives this year. For example, some fast-food chains already use automated machines that allow you to order food without queuing. Soon, restaurants might even start \u201chiring\u201d robots to serve you! With the integration of AI, autonomous things will gradually become more self-enabled to interact naturally with both their surroundings and with people. Amazing how far we\u2019ve come, isn\u2019t it?Despite the countless applications that have made our daily routines more effortless, autonomous technology has always been a controversial topic in relation to unemployment. There is a high probability that autonomous technology will displace employees from routine jobs comprising repetitive tasks such as book keeping and manufacturing, and in the not so far future, even knowledge workers. In 2019, the automation is already likely to have significant changes in our lives as Forrester predicts that \u201cby the end of 2019, automation will eliminate 20% of all service desk interactions, due to a successful combination of cognitive systems, RPA [Robotic Process Automation], and various chatbot technologies\u201d.4. Blockchain in data privacy and securityBlockchain is probably best known as the technology working behind the recent cryptocurrency mania and as one of the most popular concepts in the tech industry today. Unsurprisingly, blockchain technology has many applications outside the crypto domain.Blockchain can be defined as a distributed database of perpetually growing set of new recordings, or \u2018blocks\u2019, as they are being added to the existing database. Each block contains a timestamp linking to the previous block, forming a chain. What is different about this database is that, due to its distributed nature, no data can be deleted once added making it impossible to forge fake information or transactions. The essential function of blockchain lies in its ability to provide transparency not only to consumers but across business ecosystems as well. This beckons the topic of data privacy and ethics. With the recent enforcement of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in May 2018 and several large-scale data breaches happened all over the world in 2018 affecting hundreds of millions of users across the globe, consumers have begun to be more aware about the value of their personal information and how public and private organizations use their data.So what can you expect from blockchain technology in 2019? If you\u2019re someone who\u2019s concerned about the privacy of your data, you\u2019ll be relieved to know that blockchain will benefit you in a variety of ways:Secure data exchange in IoT devicesThe trend shows that large companies are already looking into options to use blockchain technology for secure data exchange in IoT (Internet of Things) devices, which vulnerability to cyber-attacks has been one of the main concerns in the IoT space. For example, a technology company IBM, who has been actively developing blockchain solutions since the beginning of the boom, filed a new patent in the end of 2018 for a system to securely manage data exchange of unmanned aerial vehicles such as drones to increase security and privacy. With solution the critical data such as drone\u2019s location, model, flying pattern and proximity to restricted flight zones are stored and managed in the unchangeable and distributed ledger that, for example, airspace controllers and other authorities could enhance safety and ensure authorized use of drones in certain areas.Secure decentralized access to personal dataBlockchain can also be used for secure validation to prevent unauthorized access for personal data. For example, MIT has been developing a blockchain-based distributed access and validation solution for personal healthcare data where the patients have the full control of their medical history and they can decide who gets the permission to access to it. Similar services can be used for granting access to any type of confidential data from business documents to privacy data of individuals that different authorities may need to process.Secure decentralized data storageThere are already several start-ups developing secure decentralized data storages to protect private and personal data and control the access to the data. In the decentralized system, the data is broken up into smaller pieces, stored across different nodes in the network, and then encrypted with a private key that only the owner of the data can control, making it less vulnerable to hacks.5. Diving into the digital world: immersive technologyThe goal of immersive tech is to create an \u2018always-on\u2019 environment, a real-time flow of stimuli. Gartner predicts that immersive technologies will transform our relationship with the environment within the next decade. The way we perceive the world will evolve with the emergence of technologies such as Augmented Reality (AR), Mixed Reality (MR) and Virtual Reality (VR). From pure entertainment to medicine, education and the workplace, there are many applications of immersive technologies.With the recent developments wearable immersive technologies such as the Microsoft HoloLens and Magic Leap One, bigger changes might be seen already in 2019. Have you ever wanted to know what it\u2019s like to stay on a farm? Or see what a piece of furniture will look like in your home? You need not book a tour to the country side or visit showrooms to shop, just put on a VR headset to experience the farm life \u2018first-hand\u2019 or look through your smartphone to \u2018project\u2019 the furniture into your home in reality. In fact, IKEA has already launched an AR consumer app in 2017 to \u2018try before you buy\u2019. This way, you can make measurements and shop from the comfort of your own home without the hassle of making a trip down to the store where you\u2019ll have to imagine the layout in your head.Big players like Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft are placing their early bets on immersive technologies. For example, in 2014, Facebook bought an immersive technology developer Oculus for $2 billion dollars. That\u2019s a lot of money, we know. The immersive technology market is expected to soar over the next few years. By 2022, 70% of enterprises will be experimenting with immersive technologies both for consumer and enterprise use. When combined with technologies such as artificial intelligence, immersive technology can be used to create extremely personalized products and experiences to make interactions with technology seamless and natural \u2014 almost making us unaware that we\u2019re communicating with a machine!Although these trends are not all new, interesting developments are expected to take place in 2019. As technology continues to advance at a rapid pace, we hope you\u2019re at least as excited as we are for what\u2019s to come. Let us know which of these trends you think will take 2019 by storm in the comments below.

Compatible with all versions of Truffle (up to the latest 5.0)Continuous deployment is achieved when changes to a codebase are automatically pushed live, whether to a staging or production environment.Typically:Code is pushed to a repositoryTests are run on a continuous integration (CI) serverIf tests pass, code is deployed.Continuous deployment allows us to iterate rapidly with a product.Truffle is a fantastic tool for smart contract development that makes testing and deploying contracts a breeze. The only issue preventing it from smoothly integrating with continuous deployment is the fact that it generates very heavy artifacts.Truffle artifacts contain the addresses at which the contracts are deployed. These artifacts can be pulled in or referenced by front-end code so that we can interface with them. However, the artifacts also include local filesystem paths that make them unsuitable to commit to the repository. Continuous deployment can only pull information from committed files, so how do we get around this?I\u2019ve developed a tool called Truffle Deploy Registry that separates the deployed contract address from the artifacts into files separated by network. You can .gitignore the local development networks, and commit testnet files so that the CI server can pick them up.Truffle Deploy RegistryTruffle Deploy Registry works in two stages:New deployment entries are recorded in a network-specific JSON file.The latest deployment entries are merged with the truffle artifacts after compilation.Typically with Truffle you\u2019ll be using migrations to deploy and update your smart contracts. To add contracts to the deploy registry, you must append them within your migrations:// migrations/1_initial_migration.jsvar append = require('truffle-deploy-registry').appendvar Migrations = artifacts.require(\"./Migrations.sol\");module.exports = function(deployer, network) {  deployer.deploy(Migrations).then(() => {    return append(      deployer.network_id,      { contractName: 'Migrations', address: Migrations.address }    )  })}Now that contract address will be appended to the registry for the deployed network. If you have deployed to mainnet and Ropsten, you will now have the files:networks/  1.json  3.jsonInside each of those files will be a list of deployed contracts. You would see something like:# networks/1.json[  {    contractName: 'Migrations',    address: '0x3383c29542b8c96eafed98c4aafe789ddb256e19'  }]Now you have a registry of where those contracts are stored. To merge those addresses back into the Truffle compilation artifacts you would use the apply-registry command. It takes the path to the build artifacts as a parameter:$ apply-registry build/contractsThis ensures that the artifacts contain all of the *newest* addresses defined in the registries in the networks directory.Now, when your CI server builds your front end code and pulls in the artifacts they will all have the correct addresses.I hope this helps you in some way.

OktoberfestPeter MangesFollowSep 8, 2014 \u00b7 7 min readWhen meeting my Truffle Pig, even a know nothing is able to tell that he is plagued by an acute sensitivity to the many anxieties of existence. He is often sent into somber moods by a sad story, and it is a rare day that his brow is not furrowed by as early as twelve noon. This melancholy and vulnerability to the suffering of others, of course, is part of what those who are familiar with him find charming, but, regardless, it is troubling to see how much he aches from the realities of the everyday.In the last few weeks, my Truffle Pig has taken to moping aimlessly around his apartment. His roommate and close friend, the Meat Dog, noticed this, and expressed his concern.\u201cIf you need an ear, I am willing to lend you one,\u201d said the Meat Dog, calling from the kitchen to the sitting room, where my Truffle Pig was lounging.\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to concern you with my moping,\u201d replied my Truffle Pig, dolefully, \u201cbut Oktoberfest is approaching, and it is a celebration which holds many sad associations for me.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be working here for a while,\u201d called the Meat Dog, as he stirred the bubbling contents of his vat of meat slop, over which he had been laboring for hours. \u201cI\u2019ve got time for the story, if you\u2019re willing to tell it.\u201d\u201cYes, I would appreciate the emotional release of sharing my reason for sadness,\u201d said the Truffle Pig. \u201cThank you.\u201dWhen my Truffle Pig was a child, he lived on a farm in the country, far from the city where he now worked a part-time job at a law firm, but equally far from the woods were he now practiced sniffing out truffles. He lived with his mother and his siblings in a pen owned by a kindly soy bean farmer. Here they lived in relative tranquility, the farmer providing them with their basic needs and they providing him with the warmth and affection that any good farmer may enjoy from a pet well-tended.\u201cEat your slop,\u201d my Truffle Pig\u2019s mother would say to her brood, \u201cfor the kindly soy bean farmer has culled it from his own waste, and it is a great gift indeed to be cared for with such grace and mindfulness.\u201dFor many summers, they enjoyed life in the blithe, stupid way that pigs do when they don\u2019t have to worry about sniffing out truffles or making rent with a part-time job at a law firm or getting gigs for their band. Then, one summer, something happened. Something bad.That summer, the kindly soy bean farmer\u2019s homeland suffered a drought the likes of which had not been seen in his lifetime. Soy beans need rain to give them water to grow, and soy bean farmers need soy beans to make money, and money to buy brine. The brine, of course, is used to make pickles which soy bean farmers can eat, consuming enough to sustain themselves and saving the excess in order to make slop to feed their happy, happy pigs.But with no rain, there were no soy beans to sell, and with no soy beans to sell, there was no money to buy brine, and without brine, the kindly soy bean farmer\u2019s vaults full of cucumbers went unpickled, and his hunger unfulfilled. Night after night, the very hungry and kindly soy bean farmer huddled over his ledger, trying to figure out how, despite his poor harvest, he could survive. No matter how he fiddled with the numbers, he couldn\u2019t deny that this was a tight spot.Familiar with the relationship between rain and soy beans, one of the kindly soy bean farmer\u2019s friends suggested an alternative source of brine cash. Oktoberfest was approaching, he said, and the celebration would create an incredible demand for juicy pig meat to pump into beer-paired sausages.\u201cYou\u2019ve got several fat piggies on hand,\u201d his friend said. \u201cWhy not grind up one or two of them and take a tasty slice of that Oktoberfest cheese straight to the bank?\u201dThe kindly soy bean farmer spent many nights tossing and turning, thinking over the dilemma. He loved his piggies, but he also loved satiation; he also knew that, the longer he was without brine, the more likely rot would set in, turning to mush the thousands he had invested in raw cukes. Tear stains smearing the red ink of his ledger, he went out to the pen to tell my Truffle Pig\u2019s mother the bad news: she would have to be ground into sausage, and soon \u2014 Oktoberfest was approaching.Her brood cried and cried, but she hushed them all up.\u201cMy sweet babies,\u201d she said, soothingly, \u201cdon\u2019t fret for your dear old mama. I will soon be tied up and thrown into a dark truck which will take me to a slaughterhouse far away. There, I will be shepherded into a crowded mass of destitute creatures and forced into a small, hot chamber. One by one, I will watch my cohort be taken away, and soon enough it will be my turn. I will be shoved down a dark shoot, my fall disorienting me to my surroundings, and suddenly from out of the darkness a million sharp knives will materialize which will cut me and peel me and slice me and dice me, until I am so much pig meal, fit to slide into an edible tube made from my own intestines and be sold for a single dollar bill at a fair thrown for no other reason but drunken revelry. It is a terrible end, but I will endure it happily, knowing that it will provide for our friend, the kindly soy bean farmer, and for you, my beloved brood. But rest easy: though my body may be ground down into a paste to harvest my sweet, salty meat, my soul shall forever live in heaven with the Lord our God.\u201dThen, she took my Truffle Pig aside. \u201cYou are the oldest of the brood, and thusly, I trust you to help care for our family after my mutilation. Also, as a sign of my affection for you, I have a final gift.\u201dAt this point in the story, sitting on the couch in his apartment, my Truffle Pig pulled a small brass locket out of his hiding place and presented it to his close friend, the Meat Dog.\u201cShe gave me this. Then she was taken to the slaughterhouse. I did as she asked, and watched out for the brood, and although I knew he was only doing what was necessary, I admit that my relationship with the kindly soy bean farmer was never the same again.\u201cWhen it finally came time for me to leave the pen to go to college, I was relieved. At last, I could try and forget my mother\u2019s sorrow, and attempt to move forward. I fell in with a crowd of interesting, intelligent students who read books I\u2019d never heard of, watched films I didn\u2019t realized could be burned to a disc, and consumed drugs that altered their perceptions in ways I\u2019d never experienced. They were exactly the kind of group I was looking for to spur me on to a new life.\u201cThen, one day, my friends and I began discussing God, and the afterlife. It became clear that they all had largely atheistic views. They argued marvelously for their particular ideas about the way life ended at death. When it came time for me to explain my own faith in God, I realized I couldn\u2019t justify it in the way they could. Consumed with emotion, I fled from the room. After that, I cut ties with those friends. I never spoke to them again.\u201d\u201cYou cut ties with them?\u201d repeated the Meat Dog as he nursed a spot where a bit of the scalding hot, bubbling meat slop had splashed on his face. \u201cThat seems a little extreme.\u201d\u201cBut don\u2019t you understand? I couldn\u2019t debate my friends on the merit of my faith, because I had no proof, no evidence, for what I believed. Though I didn\u2019t realize it at the time, they had planted a seed in my heart. As it grew and bloomed, I slowly realized and came to terms with the fact that, deep down, I didn\u2019t have any real faith in the existence of God.\u201cAnd without a God, what happened to my mother after she was cut up into a tiny million pieces in preparation of that Oktoberfest, so long ago? If she didn\u2019t have an eternal soul, then the beer sausage was her true end. That\u2019s why, so many summers afterward, I still feel blue when the leaves change. I can\u2019t say for sure if her faith in her own salvation by God was justified or not, but my own lack of faith makes it clear, perfectly clear, that when I die, whether there is an afterlife or not, I won\u2019t ever see my poor mother again.\u201dThe Meat Dog stepped out from the kitchen after these words, and stood in silence for a moment before saying, \u201cYes. I can understand that must be a very painful dilemma.\u201dBut my Truffle Pig knew that the Meat Dog did not understand. He was totally consumed by the tedium of which his life was composed. Day in and day out, he thought only of stirring his meat slop, making it nice and warm so that it could be poured out into tiny cups and served to all his friends who slurped it down to enjoy its sloppy deliciousness. Matters of the soul concerned him very little. His mind was situated firmly in the purely physical world of viscous meat cuisine.\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind my asking,\u201d the Meat Dog said, as he turned off the stove and lifted his vat of meat slop toward the counter, \u201cwhat is contained in your mother\u2019s locket?\u201d\u201cInside, there is a picture of her,\u201d my Truffle Pig replied, matter-of-factly, fiddling with his mother\u2019s brass locket in his hand, \u201cand on the outside, it is inscribed with the verse, \u20182 Peter 2:22.\u2019\u201dIntrigued, the Meat Dog leaned over to get a better look at the ornament. As he did this, he lost both his balance and control over the heavy, piping hot vat filled with yummy meat goo, which went flying into the air, splattering meat slop all over the kitchen and sitting room, gooping up on the walls and staining the carpet.\u201cDrat!\u201d said the Meat Dog. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I did it again! Well, better get to cleaning up.\u201dForgetting God and his mother and his everlasting soul, if only for a minute, my Truffle Pig reached for a sponge.", "responses": 0, "tags": []}, {"title": "Truffles", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@lokedo/truffles-cd5e87af9022?source=search_post", "author_name": "Lokedo", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@lokedo", "publish_date": "2016-09-04", "last_modified_date": "2018-04-11", "readtime": "0.89", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "TrufflesLokedoFollowSep 4, 2016 \u00b7 1 min readNews from Italy \u2014 deep in the mountains: Felix, my fiancee, got a black truffle as a present from a restaurant owner.

Starting in 2004 and finishing on 2007 I used the finest materials to completely reconstruct the two buildings you see today.What were you doing before this project?Before I started the Agriturismo business, I was selling my truffles to many top chefs in London and Oxford and in London\u2019s Borough Market.Why did you choose the Ascoli Piceno area to set-up?I was born and bred in the Ascoli region and so this is where my heart is. After my experience in London, I decided that the best solution is to taste the truffle in the place where it is found to appreciate the maximum fragrance and the magic of their perfume.Were there any challenges that you faced getting started?The main challenges were having the right craftsmen available at the right times, along with sourcing proper materials such as vintage bricks and stones. Sometimes bureaucracy slowed the project down.What has been the best bit about your new life?Although it is hard work, running an Agriturismo allows me to always follow my heart. Each morning I wake up to a truly beautiful panorama of nature.What tips would you give anyone else trying to set up a hotel/B&B?You need to plan and re-plan. Also, whatever your budget is, you will need 50% more!What do you think makes your place a really special place to stay?Le Marche Agriturismo Ramuse is set in a tranquil beautiful valley that brings you close to nature, being ideally placed between the Adriatic & the Sibillini mountains.I only use local products, many from my own farm such as Oliva Ascolana Tenera (a tasty olive), eggs from the free range black Ancona chickens, and our special pink apple the mele rosa dei Monti Sibillini. We have fresh peaches, cherries, apples, homemade jams and nuts to eat throughout the year. Having worked in the wine trade, I also have a very good knowledge of the local wines and have a selection available for any time of day or night.Tell us about your truffle hunting, what does a typical day as a truffle hunter involve?A day in the life of a truffle hunter begins with checking the weather. It has to be dry so that Trilly my truffle dog can smell the truffles. Next we have to dress in the hunters outfit and with our special digging tool we are ready to set off.What we bring back depends of the time of year. Truffles are seasonal with the stronger smelling White Truffle (Tuber Magnatum Pico) being found around Ramuse between October and November, and the Black summer truffle (tuber aestivum) from May to October.How do you use the truffles in your cooking?My favourite meal is freshly scrambled eggs with grated black summer truffle on top, simple but delicious!This post was originally posted on the Sawday\u2019s Journal on 18th March, 2015About Sawday\u2019sSawday\u2019s was born in 1990 from a passion for genuine connection with inspiring people and places.

I gave it a shot a few more times on other occasions as a confirmation. Confirmed: truffles are disgusting. Never will I eat truffles again. In fact, they taste like shit.Same goes with shitty jobs. I\u2019ve had shitty jobs in the past. What did I do about it? I quit, even though there were times I had nothing else lined up. Some would call this stupid, crazy, or career-killing. To me it was a no-brainer. I disliked these shitty jobs so I stopped, immediately. Just like eating truffles.I recently quit a job to take another position that offered potential for career growth and increased wealth. There was a structured career path, benefits, stock options, the works. It was a supposed to be an exciting opportunity. However, on day one, my intuition spoke to me. It said, \u201cthis is not going to work.\u201dI tried to prove it wrong. I stuck it out for a few months because I wanted to make it work. I psyched myself up before walking into the door; I recited a positive story to make myself enjoy it. However, it didn\u2019t work. \u201cConfirmed: this job sucks.\u201d So I quit. The job was like truffle fries. I remember my mom saying to stick it out for five to six months before leaving. If I didn\u2019t value my time (or life), I would have done what my mom suggested.Instead, people will hang on to soul-sucking careers. A previous client who is incredibly smart and driven refused to leave his arduous, stressful job because of his stock options. To him, the potential gain for his stock options is worth more than the uncertainty of leaving to pursue another venture. I left a job with that same potential. \u201cThere is some great opportunity. Think about the stock options,\u201d is what my manager told me. I couldn\u2019t do it. I valued creating my own path far more than what they were offering me.I can think of countless other people that are tied to shitty, dead-end jobs due to the same reason. Excuse is a more appropriate word.One thing people fail to realize is that in an instant, you have a chance to change course. I\u2019m not telling you to quit your job unless that is what it takes, since generally 50% of the population are unsatisfied at work. I\u2019m telling you to get started on what you are meant to do. If you must maintain your job to keep up with expenses and build a cushion then by all means, do it. As long as you get started on your real job.At the same time, doing something drastic like peacing out of your job might just help.The times of stagnation is when you gain clarity of what you want to do and then take action to do it. Most importantly, it\u2019s during this period when you actually have the TIME to do it.You underestimate your own resourcefulness. Trust me, you\u2019ll make it.

And nothing captures the concept of time and terroir quite like the truffle. Perhaps there exists other, more exclusive, expressions of seasonality such as guisante l\u00e1grima in Spain, or hana sansho in Japan. But no, nothing captures and captivates the imagination quite like an avalanche of truffle shaved atop a humble pile of pasta. Follow enough food personalities on Instagram and one will never be allowed to forget, when it rolls around, that it is indeed, once again, that time of the year. The time for truffles.I recall with fondness my first encounter with the mythical mushroom. Like one\u2019s first kiss, it is difficult to forget and sometimes coloured with nostalgia. I was in my first year of university in London, and it was about a week before my final exams. Naturally, I did not deign to attend any of my lessons over the course of the year and to make the situation even sweeter, I had also trekked down to Copenhagen for a meal at Noma during the first week of the month-long study break meant for revision. Attempting an entire year\u2019s worth of work in less than a month culminated into stress eating in the form of blowing half a month\u2019s worth of rent on a meal at Restaurant Gordon Ramsay. I realised, thankfully with more wisdom than my attitude towards my studies might belie, that hailing a Black Cab would mean entrenching myself further in abject poverty. And so, on that fateful Spring afternoon, I found myself trundling across Central London on a bus towards Royal Hospital Road for a meal that would change my opinion on the truffle forever.The restaurant is surprisingly easy to miss if one does not know to look out for it. With a classy and understated exterior, it blends right into its surroundings of posh Chelsea houses. The meal was to be my first in a 3 Michelin starred restaurant, and I walked in through the entrance into a narrow, dimly lit, corridor with trepidation. It is terribly easy to initially be intimidated by the trappings of fine French dining with its immaculate table setting, flawlessly polished cutlery, and perfectly drilled wait staff. But I have come to realise that all of it is really just there to make one feel well taken care of, a job which the staff in most of restaurants of the type take quite seriously.The tasting menu we chose that day did not include any dishes with truffle in them, but when Jean-Claude, who has been working with Gordon since the days of Aubergine, brought some truffles out to the table it was impossible to resist. The smell was sensually seductive, and I hesitated for all of three seconds before agreeing to supplement an extra dish of truffle pasta with a parmesan emulsion. I still recall when the dish was finally served. It was a magical experience, a visceral feeling of indulgence as the eternally hospitable Jean-Paul shaved enough truffle to completely obscure the view of the pasta from every possible angle. The intense flavour and aroma of the truffles were a far cry from my previous experiences with what I thought was truffle, but was simply a synthetic chemical masquerading under the name of truffle oil. Thus began my love affair with this not-so-humble ingredient.The Alba white truffle often gets an unfair amount of attention compared to its other, supposedly lesser, cousins. This is almost certainly due to its relative rarity and correspondingly obscene prices posted in restaurants. Indeed, especially in the higher echelons of dining, it sometimes feels like the truffle season is choreographed to extract as much money out of you as feasibly possible. Stratospheric food bills which come up to quadruple digit figures per head before even figuring in wine are not out of the question. Multi-starred Parisian establishments feature menus which include Alba truffles in every course, including dessert, at the peak of the season each year. My fascination with truffles do not, however, lie in the appeal of shaving truffles on every conceivable dish that lands in front of me, desserts inclusive. I would hardly call it a truism that truffles make everything better. Because it most certainly does not. And certainly if it does, it feels like a rather lazy way of making your food taste better does it not? No, my fascination with the truffle lies in how it can be used in cooking. Unlike the heat-sensitive Alba truffles which must be served raw, P\u00e9rigord truffles often benefit from some sort of heat treatment. The fascination must then lie not in the famed White Gold of Alba, but the Black Diamond of P\u00e9rigord. It is with the P\u00e9rigord truffle that a chef can truly showcase his prowess and creativity.   Even within the trope of truffle with pasta, the best variation I have had required significant kitchen intervention. For that, we will have to visit the ultraluxe Le Cinq housed in the George V Hotel in Paris. Quite in opposition to the trend of restaurants trying to make fine dining more accessible, Le Cinq continues to be one of the most, if not the most, unabashedly opulent fine dining restaurants in Paris and the world. Even Restaurant Gordon Ramsay, which many on the other side of the Channel consider stuffy, looks downright unremarkable in comparison. The dining room is adorned with plush carpets, towering ceilings which reach towards the heavens, and chandeliers that look as if they were plucked out of the Almighty\u2019s throne room itself. It has, naturally, prices to match, with less than a handful of dishes on the menu that cost below a hundred euros. Your date won\u2019t be aware of any of this, though; The restaurant continues to practice the delightfully dated policy of providing the females in the dining party a menu without prices on them.Enter Christian Le Squer\u2019s Spaghetti Nest. It arrives at the table, unassuming. A box meticulously constructed using strands of spaghetti, almost gravity defying in its symmetry and structural strength. But it is when one pierces the prison that the magic begins. The musky perfume of the truffle mushrooms baked within are freed with one clean slice. It floods the olfactory nerve, almost overwhelming the nose. We taste with our sense of smell, many experts claim. But one does not quite realise the meaning of this till one sits through an experience like this one. The cream and butter sauce flows out onto the plate, mingling with the generous portion of truffle jus. Each individual strand of spaghetti manages to have a toothy al dente bounce despite standing ram-rod straight on the plate. Oven roasting the spaghetti imparts a magnificent toasted flavour, reminiscent of, as Massimo Bottura might astutely observe, the crunchy part of a lasagna. The sauce is exactly how some might like their partners: rich, beautiful, but never overbearing. Le Squer outdoes himself here, which, considering the bar his other dishes set, says a lot. His creation is magnificence encapsulated, fit for the king the restaurant and hotel were named after.   The truffle-centric dish in French cuisine is a thing of beauty, but like trying to find the girl of one\u2019s dreams being able to locate one can be a trial in and of itself. It is an expression of excess and exclusivity. It pushes boundaries and knows no limits. It is luxury epitomised. And for all of these reasons, it is exceedingly rare to find outside of Parisian triple-starred establishments for the mere simple reality of economics. Unless one\u2019s customers can afford the astronomical price tag that accompanies a dish that consists of, on certain occasions, an entire truffle, said dish would never even be conceived in the first place. But while the classic Black Diamond dishes now exist almost exclusively in Parisian temples such as Le Cinq, l\u2019Ambroisie, and Epicure, its origins lie further East. With the sad passing of gastronomic giant Paul Bocuse earlier this year, the truffle soup he had cooked for the French president in 1975 received renewed media attention. Over the years there have been many similar dishes that have sprouted forth, or are, one suspects, at least tangentially influenced by this dish.  Two examples that jump straight to mind are also two of the best dishes I have tasted to date. The first is Guy Savoy\u2019s Artichoke and Black Truffle soup. The dish is a harmony of opposites, a complement of contrasts. A dish with both artichoke and truffle is from the outset a strange concept on paper. While P\u00e9rigord truffles peak in the winter, artichokes peak in the summer. One can\u2019t have one while having the other, it seems. Yet there it sits, with all concept of seasonality and locality thrown out of the window. It works, somehow. A cornucopia of texture, temperature, and tastes. The velvety soup that is unctuous and rich, exuding an aroma that is at odds with any issues of using out of season artichokes at the expense of truffles in their prime. The truffle brioche that has a perfect crust and a cloud-like interior which only the French can manage. The truffle butter that is almost cold to the touch but perfectly yielding to the petite knife. It is a medley of contrasts. The silky soup matched with the buttery brioche; the chilled butter matched with the warm crust \u2014 All of this comes together to become something that the separate parts could not have managed on their own.  The second example is Gilles Goujon\u2019s stonkingly good \u201cRotten Egg\u201d dish. Goujon\u2019s restaurant, l\u2019Auberge du Vieux Puits, is well regarded among the well-heeled French community, but understandably less well known internationally. The restaurant is located in the decidedly rural village of Fontjocuse in the South of France, and is about a hundred miles away from Toulouse, the closest urban city. And a village it is, for there are only about a hundred inhabitants living there. Between the wait and kitchen staff, it is rather likely that half of the commune is under the employ of Goujon alone. From the designated exit out of the highway, it is a further 45 minute drive up mountainous winding single-laned dirt roads. One would hardly expect this to be the location for a temple of gastronomy. Thankfully, it is far from an unenjoyable journey, and we were treated with stunning views and green valleys that stretched out for miles when visiting in spring. Those unfortunate enough to suffer from bouts of motion sickness might claim otherwise, however.The \u201cRotten Egg\u201d dish in question begins simply enough, an egg sitting on a bed of pureed truffles. The diner cracks the egg, only to, in a modernist twist, discover it is \u201crotten\u201d as a truffle jus flows out. The server then tops up the dish with a truffle sabayon and a generous shaving of truffles before bringing a truffle cappuccino and some truffle brioche to the table. Excessive? Certainly. Effective? Without a doubt. It is a truffle tour de force, showcasing all the potential of the Black Diamond and more. Each individual component shines on its own and, when put all together, beckons one to think, to ponder, to drink in the wonder. Over here, the truffle cappuccino is almost certainly derived from Alain Chapel\u2019s famed mushroom cappuccino. Interestingly enough, this was a dish that rose to prominence in the 70s too. Whether Chapel drew inspiration from Bocuse I myself do not know, but it is not unlikely. Ideas, especially in gastronomy, are not usually born in a vacuum through Immaculate Conception.  The OG truffle soup a la Bocuse is still the truffle plat d\u2019anthologie that exists in the minds of most people, but there is one truffle dish in history that almost certainly precedes this. Bocuse has cited the influence of Paul Haeberlin, founder of l\u2019Auberge de l\u2019Ill, in the creation of his Truffle soup. He mentions that Haeberlin had, earlier on in 1975, served him a simple dish of truffles and foie in a ramekin covered with puff pastry. He adapted this into the soup that has now become a stalwart on his menu for four decades. l\u2019Auberge de l\u2019Ill is now helmed by Paul\u2019s son Marc, who, from my meal there last year has exceeded even his father\u2019s skill. Paul Haeberlin has had many signature dishes over the course of his illustrious cooking career, of which I\u2019ve had the privilege to try a few in my trip to the Alsace last summer. While I walked away more impressed by Marc\u2019s magnificent Quail Maki than Paul\u2019s historic Salmon Souffl\u00e9, there is one dish in Paul\u2019s r\u00e9pertoire that stood out among all the others during the peak of his culinary career: truffe sous la cendre, literally truffle under the ashes.  Having made my visit in summer, I naturally did not manage to sample the dish. The odd photo of it still manages to find its way online, but almost never onto Instagram. That is not surprising. The dish is unabashedly unphotogenic in a way only dishes in the 70s could be, when photos of your meals were not only uncommon but unacceptable. An entire truffle is insulated with a forcemeat of pork, pigeon, and foie, wrapped in puff pastry, before being baked till perfection. If it sounds slightly unrefined, perhaps you might be right. But recall that fine dining has evolved much for the past forty years and is a very different beast now compared to then.  For a contemporary, almost literal, interpretation of a truffle under the ashes, one need not look further than the Le Bristol Hotel in Paris, the location of Eric Frenchon\u2019s Epicure. It is a dish that is nothing if not ambitious: an entire truffle baked in a salt crust served with a Jerusalem artichoke. Frenchon even goes so far as to list the dish under \u201cMeat\u201d with the simple title of P\u00e9rigord Truffle. If there is any restaurant one might have expected to find this dish, it would have been here and perhaps Apicius under Vigato. Both restaurants named after famous classical figures which indulged in luxury, both restaurants making their mark through the updating of the French Classics. The theatricality of the dish is impressive for sure, with the salt crust cut open right in front of you and the whole truffle gingerly lifted onto the serving plate. A good dish lives and dies on the quality of its ingredients, but something that involves an entire truffle truly has nowhere to hide. Unfortunately, the specimen I was served that day was less than absolutely pristine. Pleasant for sure, but not reaching anywhere near the heights of the other dishes I mention within this piece. It is certainly tragic, for a chef has to have a certain amount of chutzpah to serve a dish such as this, and I had hoped that the actual result would match up to the accolades and ambition. His other signature truffle dish, what is essentially a very posh truffle mac and cheese, fell rather flat too. The combination of parmesan, truffles, and foie gras proved far too cloying and heavy even for a self-confessed lover of rich classical French saucing like myself.  But all is not lost in Paris. If one turns up at the temple of Bernard Pacaud during the peak of P\u00e9rigord season, one might be fortunate enough to see the Feuillete\u0301 de Truffe Frai\u0302che \u201cBel Humeur\u201d on the menu. Conceived in the early 1980s, the usually reliable Lucky Peach magazine suggests that it was inspired by the Bocuse\u2019s en croute style. I disagree with the notion. Bocuse slapped a puff pastry lid on top of a soup bowl and baked his sea bass in puff pastry. That hardly makes it his \u201cstyle,\u201d and any links to Pacaud\u2019s truffle pie is tenuous at best. Besides, if anything, Pacaud had already made a name for himself before this with his legendary (and astonishingly elusive) savoury pies. If you ask me, the missing link between Pacaud and Bocuse\u2019s black diamond dishes is Haeberlin\u2019s Truffle under the Ashes. In essence, Pacaud\u2019s dish does not differ much compared to that of Haeberlin\u2019s apart from the lack of forcemeat. Much like sculpting, Pacaud achieves perfection by removing till there is nothing left to remove.  The dish stands up remarkably well to its contemporaries even today. It is perhaps a testament to Pacaud\u2019s food being far ahead of its time. The pie arrives sitting on a jet-black truffle coulis. A sharp crack permeates through the dining room as the knife cuts through the perfectly crisp puff pastry, unleashing the aromas within. Steam snakes lazily out of the pie, up toward the high ceilings. The foie has melted partially inside the pie, the fat simultaneously steaming and frying the thick hunks of truffle within as it does so. So strong and pungent was the wonderful scent that I could almost swear the smoke had been perfumed black from the truffles. A token salad is provided on the side, perhaps to act as a palate cleanser of sorts, perhaps as a way to assuage the guilt of gluttony. It does not work terribly well for either purpose but does serve as a rather amusing distraction. The thick and generous cuts of truffle make a marked difference. There is something special about biting into a large piece of black truffle. Is it the lightly yielding bite that is almost slightly reminiscent of mortadella? Is it that punch of flavour from getting so much truffle in a single mouthful? Or perhaps it is just the sense of decadence. This is pure hedonism at its best. Every bite brings about a heady giddiness, and it is almost too much to bear. But one must soldier on and bask in all the glory that the dish offers.  I was once fortunate enough to have been brought on a whirlwind weekend truffle tour in Italy by Gordon Ramsay\u2019s truffle supplier, Alfredo. He zoomed us around central Italy in a rental car at the kind of breakneck speeds that only the Italians can manage, plying my friend and I with more truffles and wine than would be wise to consume in a single month, let alone in a single weekend. But perhaps the highlight of the entire trip was when Alfredo generously invited us to the home of his mother-in-law for a Sunday lunch. It was a decidedly simple, yet decadently luxurious, feast. Fresh pasta was made on the spot while Davide, head chef of Union Street Kitchen in London, whipped up a sauce made of chopped truffle ends, parmesan, and butter. It was neither complicated nor particularly sophisticated but I can count very few lunches which I have enjoyed more. There is something terribly comforting about digging into an intoxicating plate of fresh pasta after coming in from the cold snow covering the ground outside like a white linen tablecloth.To me, that is what the annual truffle season represents. A comforting indulgence, a warm blanket of deep, concentrated, flavour. More than anything, the limited seasonality of the ingredient forces us to appreciate its presence when it is around. It is transient and ephemeral. And it is a reminder for us all to seize the moment when it arrives. Or perhaps, at the very least, seize the truffle and eat it.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Food", "Truffle", "Fine Dining"]}, {"title": "", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@tapdev/ive-made-a-slight-adjustment-to-installing-truffle-e70c1d550ddd?source=search_post", "author_name": "Hugh Knight", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@tapdev", "publish_date": "2017-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2018-01-20", "readtime": "0.29", "claps": 14, "voters": 1, "content": "Your First Truffle Dapp \u2014 An attempt at a beginners guide to the Truffle Framework \u2014 Part 2494Hugh KnightHugh KnightFollowAug 16, 2017 \u00b7 1 min readI\u2019ve made a slight adjustment to installing truffle.

Unlike most of the items lining grocery store aisles, truffles have not yet been able to be mastered for mass production. Instead, the fungal delicacies grow haphazardly on the roots of specific species of trees and are hunted down by specially trained canines. Traditionally, wild hogs uncovered truffles; however, the boar-ish truffle detectives proved just as unwieldy as their fungal counterpart. They would often eat the truffles before hunters could collect them. Truffle hound dogs, on the other hand, do not consume the fungus.While an efficient process for growing and gathering whole truffles remains elusive, \u201ctruffle oil\u201d is ubiquitous among both top chefs and kitchen amateurs. How can a product derived from a rare good be so widely available? As one might guess, truffle oil does not contain truffles. Over the past century, as deforestation has increased and climates have changed, the annual global harvest of truffles has declined drastically. In the past, when truffles were more abundant, Italians would infuse olive oil with actual pieces of truffle, giving it a distinct earthy taste. As time passed and truffles became more expensive, this practice became rear. Moreover, it was not at all commercially viable.However, food scientists came up with a clever plan, and truffle-less truffle oil was born. Modern truffle oil is a concoction of olive oil and truffle scent. The scent is a result of the chemical 2,4-dithiapentane, which gives the oil a pungent smell and metallic taste. For most consumers, dining on fresh truffle is a luxury they will never experience. As a result, they are unbothered by the fact that truffle oil tastes nothing like an actual truffle. With the fraudulently named \u2018truffle\u2019 oil, producers get to charge a premium for smelly olive oil, and consumers get to feel indulgent.

Recently, there has been a general request to write something about \u201chow to build\u201d this awesome thing called Graal. Technically, we will be building HotSpot\u2019s C2 compiler (look for C2 in the glossary list) replacement, called Graal. This binary is different from the GraalVM suite you download from OTN via http://graalvm.org/downloads.I wasn\u2019t just going to stop at the first couple of posts on this technology. In fact, one of the best ways to learn and get an in-depth idea about how any tech works is to know how to build it.Getting StartedBuilding JVMCI for JDK8, Graal, and Truffle is fairly simple, and the instructions are available on the Graal repo. We will be running them on both the local (Linux, MacOS) and container (Docker) environments. To capture the process as code, they have been written in Bash; check it out here.During the process of writing the scripts and testing them on various environments, there were some issues, but these were soon resolved with the help members of the Graal team \u2014 thanks, Doug!Running ScriptsDocumentation on how to run the scripts are provided in the README.md on awesome-graal. For each of the build environments, they are merely a single command:Linux and MacOS$ ./local-build.sh$ RUN_TESTS=false           ./local-build.sh$ OUTPUT_DIR=/another/path/ ./local-build.shDocker$ ./docker-build.sh$ DEBUG=true                 ./docker-build.sh$ RUN_TESTS=false            ./docker-build.sh$ OUTPUT_DIR=/another/path/  ./docker-build.shBoth the local and Docker scripts pass in the environment variables i.e. RUN_TESTS and OUTPUT_DIR to the underlying commands. Debugging the Docker container is also possible by setting the DEBUG environment variable.For a better understanding of how they work, it is best to refer to the local and Docker scripts in the repo.Build LogsI have provided build logs for the respective environments in the build/x86_64/linux_macos folder here.Once the build is completed successfully, the following messages are shown:[snipped]>> Creating /path/to/awesome-graal/build/x86_64/linux/jdk8-with-graal from /path/to/awesome-graal/build/x86_64/linux/graal-jvmci-8/jdk1.8.0_144/linux-amd64/productCopying /path/to/awesome-graal/build/x86_64/linux/graal/compiler/mxbuild/dists/graal.jar to /path/to/awesome-graal/build/x86_64/linux/jdk8-with-graal/jre/lib/jvmciCopying /path/to/awesome-graal/build/x86_64/linux/graal/compiler/mxbuild/dists/graal-management.jar to /path/to/awesome-graal/build/x86_64/linux/jdk8-with-graal/jre/lib/jvmciCopying /path/to/awesome-graal/build/x86_64/linux/graal/sdk/mxbuild/dists/graal-sdk.jar to /path/to/awesome-graal/build/x86_64/linux/jdk8-with-graal/jre/lib/bootCopying /path/to/awesome-graal/build/x86_64/linux/graal/truffle/mxbuild/dists/truffle-api.jar to /path/to/awesome-graal/build/x86_64/linux/jdk8-with-graal/jre/lib/truffle>>> All good, now pick your JDK from /path/to/awesome-graal/build/x86_64/linux/jdk8-with-graal :-)Creating Archive and SHA of the newly JDK8 with Graal & Truffle at /home/graal/jdk8-with-graalCreating Archive jdk8-with-graal.tar.gzCreating a sha5 hash from jdk8-with-graal.tar.gzjdk8-with-graal.tar.gz and jdk8-with-graal.tar.gz.sha256sum.txt have been successfully created in the /home/graal/output folder.ArtifactsAll the Graal and Truffle artifacts are created in the graal/compiler/mxbuild/dists/ folder and copied to the newly built jdk8-with-graal folder. Both of these will be present in the folder where the build.sh script resides:jdk8-with-graal/jre/lib/jvmci/graal.jar jdk8-with-graal/jre/lib/jvmci/graal-management.jar jdk8-with-graal/jre/lib/boot/graal-sdk.jar jdk8-with-graal/jre/lib/truffle/truffle-api.jarIn short, we started off with vanilla JDK8 (JAVA_HOME) and the build script created an enhanced JDK8 with both Graal and Truffle embedded in it. At the end of a successful build process, the script will create a .tar.gz archive file in the jdk8-with-graal-local folder, alongside this file you will also find the sha5 hash of the archive.In case of a Docker build, the same folder is called jdk8-with-graal-docker. In addition to the above-mentioned files, it will also contain the build logs.Running Unit TestsRunning unit tests is a simple command:mx --java-home /path/to/jdk8 unittestThis step should follow the moment we have a successfully built artifact in the jdk8-with-graal-local folder. The below messages indicate a successful run of the unit tests:>>>> Running unit tests...

If you have a more accurate way to benchmark such running processes, please do share back.SummaryIn this post, we saw how we can build Graal and Truffle for JDK8 on both local and container environments.The next thing we will do is build them on a build farm provided by Adopt OpenJDK. We will be able to run them across multiple platforms and operating systems, including building inside Docker containers. This binary is different from the GraalVM suite you download from OTN via http://graalvm.org/downloads, hopefully we will be able to cover GraalVM in a future post.Thanks to Julien Ponge for making his build script available for re-use and the Graal team for the support during the writing of this post.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Graal", "Jvmci", "Openjdk", "Truffle", "Jdk"]}, {"title": "Configuring Truffle to use the Goerli testnet", "post_link": "https://medium.com/coinmonks/configuring-truffle-to-use-the-goerli-testnet-70313e0a7459?source=search_post", "author_name": "Eliott Teissonniere", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@eliott_t", "publish_date": "2019-03-07", "last_modified_date": "2019-03-12", "readtime": "1.50", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "Configuring Truffle to use the Goerli testnetEliott TeissonniereFollowMar 7 \u00b7 2 min readINFURA recently announced it implemented supports for the new and awesome Ethereum G\u00f6rli testnet.

However, you will soon find you want to test the app on a live blockchain. Ethereum allows you to test on a network call Rinkeby before deploying your app live. In this guide, I\u2019ll take your through a deployment on Rinkeby, including setting up your account, and testing your app.This app uses Truffle and assumes you have done the following:1. Read about Ethereum: https://www.ethereum.org/2. Gone through the Pet tutorial with Truffle and MetaMask: http://truffleframework.com/tutorials/pet-shopDownload the Mist walletTo start, you will need to sink the Rinkeby network locally and to have it running so we can send our app. Start by downloading the official Ethereum wallet on this page https://www.ethereum.org/.Sync the Rinkeby NetworkOnce downloaded and installed, open the app and click Use Rinkeby.Enter a password for your Rinkeby account.Then take note of where your wallet info is stored.Wait for the network to sync (this could take a few hours). Then click \u201cLaunch Application\u201d.Getting EtherThe next step is to request Ether from the Rinkeby Faucet. The faucet is setup to give users test out their applications on the network. On the actual Ethereum network, you will need to mine or buy ether to use your app.To prevent malicious actors, Rinkeby asks users to use Social Media to request Ether. You can read more about there here: https://www.rinkeby.io/#faucet.For this tutorial, we will use Twitter to request ether. Note that it can take a few hours to a few days depending on how much ether you request.1. Start by getting your test account number from MistSelect the wallets tab at the top and copy the address for one of your accounts. You should have one Main Account now if you have been following along.2. Go to the Faucet Page and click the \u201cTweet\u201d linkThis will load a populated tweet where you can enter your test network address to request Eth. Go ahead and past your address in the place of the 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 address.3. Paste the Link on the Faucet pageGo back to the faucet page. You will see a form at the top. Paste the link to your post there and click how much Ether you would like to request.You will then be presented with a loading screen to show when your Ether will be funded.Deploying Truffle App to RinkebyNow that we have some Ether, let\u2019s deploy an app to test. Feel free to use an app you have already built, for this tutorial, I will use an example app from Truffle. We will then deploy the the Dapp to the test network Rinkeby.1. Use the App from the Pet Shop TutorialCreating a Dapp is out of scope of this tutorial. We will be using the completed example from the Pet Shop tutorial: http://truffleframework.com/tutorials/pet-shop. Find that directory from your tutorial.2. Install GethWe will need the geth command line tool to run Rinkeby. Use the following url and find your install instructions for your platform: https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Building-Ethereum3. Run Rinkeby from the Command LineReplace the address below with your test Ethereum address and the password with the one you used during Mist setup.geth --rinkeby --rpc --rpcapi db,eth,net,web3,personal --unlock=\"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000\" --pasword <Yourpassword> --rpccorsdomain http://localhost:30004. Add Rinkeby to your Truffle deploy configBe sure to add your test Ethereum address in place of the place holder.// truffle.jsmodule.exports = { networks: {   development: {     host: \u201clocalhost\u201d,     port: 8545,     network_id: \u201c*\u201d, // Match any network id   },   rinkeby: {     host: \u201clocalhost\u201d, // Connect to geth on the specified     port: 8545,     from: \u201c0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000\u201d,     network_id: 4,     gas: 4612388 // Gas limit used for deploys   } }};5. Migrate your Truffle app to Rinkebytruffle migrate --network rinkeby6. View your contracts on Etherscanhttps://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/YOUR-WALLET-HEREUsing your AppOkay, now we have successfully deployed our app on Rinkeby. The next thing to do is use it. We will simply run the app locally and switch Metamask to the Rinkeby test network. This will allow use to send transactions through Rinkeby rather than our local testrpc from before.1. Start the appWe are running this locally, but you can deploy this Netlify, AWS, Azure, etc and Metamask will inject the web3 console to allow for use on the blockchain.npm run devGo to Mist and click File -> Backup -> Accounts. Click on rinkeby -> keystore. This is the file you will need.Go to Metamask in your browser, select Rinkeby, import account then select the file above. Enter your password.3. Use the appNow open up your app and you are running on the Rinkeby test net!ConclusionThere is a lot going on here, but most of it is one time set up with your Wallet. Once you have an account and Ether, it should be easy to test out future apps.Let me know if you have any questions by commented below or messaging me on Twitter at @thehollidayinnOriginally published at blog.koalatea.io on January 4, 2018.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Blockchain", "Dapps", "Truffle"]}, {"title": "", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@andigiga/truffle-deploy-dos-not-exist-my-options-are-commands-1fcbb9081774?source=search_post", "author_name": "Andi Giga", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@andigiga", "publish_date": "2016-10-20", "last_modified_date": "2017-11-01", "readtime": "0.48", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "A 101 Noob Intro to Programming Smart Contracts on Ethereum6.4K43ConsenSysAndi GigaFollowOct 20, 2016 \u00b7 1 min read`truffle deploy` dos not exist.

Oil: Why Communication Failstom heringFollowMar 14, 2017 \u00b7 2 min readI love variety.From beer to ice cream, books to sneakers, I always seem to find something to suit my particular taste.Never has that been more underscored than my recent visit to a local olive oil and vinegar shop.I opened the doors and found my eyes greeted with gleaming rows of stainless steel containers holding all kinds of exotic olive oils, vinegars and gourmet truffle oils. Even better, I could sample whatever spoke to my tastebuds.And so I did.Which brought up a puzzling question about communication.How do you truly connect with your audience in this micronized world we now live in?After all, you might love New England IPAs while I gravitate to Oregon Coffee Stouts. You might prefer mystery novels while I read self-help books. Your political views might go middle-of-the-road while mine lean left.So how do you make sure your communication is relevant? Here are three critical keys:1. First of all, you really need to understand your audience. In this data-centric world we live in, all kinds of research can be found with just a few Google searches. If for some reason you come up empty there, cost-efficient qualitative research can be conducted with a simple SurveyMonkey questionnaire.2. Second, talk to someone who is in your audience. Ask them about their fears and concerns. As I\u2019ve said before, walk in their shoes. Read what they read. Taste what they taste. Feel what they feel.3. Third, while crafting your message, make sure you work a common thread through your words, from start to finish. Your research in steps one and two should already tell you what that thread is.But if you\u2019re still stuck and not sure about the underpinnings of your audience, think of the brilliant American psychologist Abraham Maslow. As you know (and he proved more than 70 years ago), everyone wants to:\u00b7 Feel they have a sense of purpose\u00b7 Feel they are loved\u00b7 Feel they are protectedIt\u2019s a safe bet that through a combination of these three steps, you will be able to communicate with passion and conviction.And your message undoubtedly will be memorable.Kind of like my tastings of the Black Truffle Oil and Champagne Vinegar.For our most-read blog post on effective communication, just click here.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Communication", "Content Creation", "Action", "Life Lessons", "Decision

I recommend using Ganache, which you install by running npm install -g ganache-cli.Next let\u2019s make sure we have our ganache running in the background. Open your terminal and run the command ganache-cli. That's all! It runs on port 8545by default, just like most Ethereum RPCs, and so does Truffle.Also note that when ganachefirst starts, it prints out a list of accounts that will be pre-funded with ether, along with a twelve-word seed phrase for re-generating those accounts. You can use this seed phrase to initialize your MetaMask client with the same accounts, and you\u2019ll have lots of Ether when you start! (Ether is used to pay for network usage, or gas, on the Ethereum network)If you wanted to start up ganachewith the accounts you already have in MetaMask, you can tell ganachewhat seed phrase to use with the -m flag. For example:$ ganache-cli -m \"concert load couple harbor equip island argue ramp clarify fence smart topic\"Setting up a simple Truffle DappNext, let\u2019s generate a basic Truffle dapp. The default result of truffle initis a simple example currency.To get it up and running, run these commands:mkdir metacoin# Create a folder for your new dappcd metacoin# Move into that foldertruffle init # Initialize a default truffle project in that foldertruffle compilertruffle migrate # Build, compile, & deploy the dapptruffle test test/metacoin.jsSetting up MetamaskIf you visit it, you\u2019ll see that by default this new Dapp template signs you in with the first account on your ganache-cli account list, which happens to be the same account that got pre-populated with 10k shiny new Metacoins! That's because when you ran truffle migrate, Truffle used your first account as the contract publisher, and the contract says to fund the creator's account with 10k coins.You can now send those coins to any account you want, for example, the second account in your ganache-cli list! If you enter an address and a value, and hit send, you'll see your balance go down!If that seems a little too easy, I\u2019d agree with you! That\u2019s why Metamask gives the user an opportunity to approve every transaction that a Dapp attempts, and that\u2019s more secure!Let\u2019s try connecting to the same account through Metamask, and see how easy it is!Setting up MetamaskNow you\u2019ll want to install Metamask from the Chrome store.Please see how to install MetamaskOpen MetamaskClick the current network name in the top right.Select Custom RPCSet the current RPCLocalhost:8545address.5. fill in the second account (0x035b9094158fc6af051242b6c04444c017b7e17c) and amount of 36. You will see the the result of transaction.This has been a simple example, but hopefully shows how Truffle and Metamask work together. They are able to pretty much work out of the box! That\u2019s because Truffle helps you write web3-compliant dapps.

Although I admit that scouring the web and getting roped into Reddit rabbit holes can be fun (and a good mind mapping exercise), it sucks away precious BUIDL time.That was precisely our impetus for crowdsourcing a list of the best platforms, services, tools, and infrastructure in the Ethereum ecosystem. We initially leveraged our own teams to create a baseline list, and then opened it up to the broader Ethereum community. We have already received dozens of pull requests \u2014 thank you to everyone for contributing! In the spirit of collaboration and to further the community\u2019s mission, please continue submitting pull requests and growing the knowledge base. All of us play a critical role in our shared vision to build a decentralized future.Deep dive series launchAt ConsenSys, we recognized that there is a need to scratch below the surface and provide a more in-depth explanation of the various platforms, services, tools, and infrastructure captured in the github repository. For that reason, we decided to kick-off a series of posts to do just that.I am thrilled to be writing the inaugural post on a massively critical component of the Ethereum ecosystem: Truffle. It serves so many different purposes and as the team has accurately dubbed it, Truffle is \u201cyour Ethereum swiss army knife.\u201dFirst one up to bat: TruffleConsenSys functions in many ways like an incubator, now with 50+ decentralized companies. Truffle is one of those companies, and I had the pleasure of interviewing several folks from the Truffle team to talk about topics including Truffle\u2019s mission, strategic goals, and culture. We also discussed ConsenSys\u2019 unorthodox organizational structure \u2014 a decentralized, flat meritocracy \u2014 and how Truffle has fine tuned this approach to self-organize in a way that works best for them.Before getting into the interview, however, I\u2019ll provide an overview of the Truffle suite of products, deep diving into some of the features that showcase Truffle\u2019s immense benefits. By the end, you\u2019ll have a full picture of how the Truffle suite really does make developing on Ethereum that much sweeter! So, let\u2019s bite right in.What is Truffle and is chocolate included?Truffle is a powerful development framework that makes building on Ethereum way easier. Chocolate is not included, but maybe Truffle can help you develop a DApp to validate the authenticity of a truffle and help us all from getting duped by fake ganaches!Alright, in all seriousness, Truffle is a must-have for Ethereum developers. Let me start by providing a brief history of the project and what problems Tim Coulter, Truffle\u2019s founder, set out to solve.Where it all started: a brief historyTim Coulter was faced with all of the same issues that plagued early Ethereum development: multiple libraries and 20+ steps to interact with smart contracts and deploy them to the Ethereum virtual machine. So, Tim started developing a series of libraries to handle all of the tasks and released the first version of Truffle in 2015. Today, Truffle has become the Ruby on Rails to Ethereum development. It is a mature framework and is on it\u2019s fourth release. The Truffle fam has grown, expanding to a suite of products that includes Ganache and Drizzle. Check out Truffle\u2019s suite usage dashboard. There were 80,000+ downloads of Truffle alone just last month!Today, Truffle is jam-packed with features to make your life as a developer easy peasy:Built in smart contract compilation: compile solidity code into Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecode and create an Application Binary Interface (ABI)Library linking: copy and paste addresses into bytecodeSmart contract testing: with mocha and chai, and a solidity testing framework. Javascript is supported as well for testing.Configurable build pipeline: support for custom build processesNetwork management: deploy to many public or private networks. Can migrate contracts to either a local test net e.g., Ganache (more on this later) or a live network like Ropsten, Rinkeby, or the main Ethereum networkFront-end integration: Drizzle (described in more detail below) handles boilerplate front-end tasks required by blockchain applicationsYour turn: getting started with TruffleAs I\u2019ve mentioned, Truffle is a mature suite of products. The team has created extensive documentation, including tutorials and even something that they call \u201cTruffle boxes\u201d complete with modules, contracts and libraries, front-end views, and entire dApp examples. If you are so inclined, you can even create your own Truffle box and share it with the community!I personally benefited from the Pet Shop Tutorial when I was just getting started with Ethereum development. The tutorial provides a great real-world example of how Truffle can be used to create a dApp to identify and track pet adoptions.Ganache and DrizzleTruffle is about to get even sweeter. If you haven\u2019t caved yet and found some chocolate to eat, I commend you \ud83d\ude04Ganache is a personal development blockchain based on Javascript that lives entirely on your local machine. It comes as either a CLI or a GUI, has detailed mining controls (allowing you to set gas limits and block time), has log output, is fully byzantium compatible, and even allows chain forking! (ability to run transactions or deploy contracts against the state of a live network such as mainnet or testnet, without spending any ether).Drizzle is a collection of front-end libraries that makes writing dApp front-ends easier. It handles crucial tasks like hooking up to the Ethereum blockchain via web3, instantiating contracts, and tracking contract data such as state, transactions, and events.Now for the sweeter stuff: Truffle team interviewNow that we have covered Truffle\u2019s functionality, let\u2019s get personal and have some fun with the Truffle team. Shout-out to g. nick d\u2019andrea, Engineering Lead, for providing these responses.How is the Truffle team organized? How are decisions made?Truffle is a bit more hierarchical than other parts of ConsenSys. Everyone works on multiple projects simultaneously, there is a leadership team (although everyone serves on it), the team has goals and we work within constraints. Something that I found particularly interesting is a management decision list that the Truffle team uses to determine who has the authority to make decisions. There are 5 key pillars:Decisions you are empowered to makeDecisions you are empowered to make as a teamDecisions you are empowered to make, but must inform meDecisions you are empowered to make if I approveDecisions only I can makeThe team strives to create a culture in which all decisions fall into the first and second pillar.ConsenSys encourages flat meritocracy, but since it is also decentralized, spokes are free to make their own choices. Why did you decide to structure yourselves more hierarchically? What other organizational decisions have you made that may differ from the broader mesh?Truffle seeks to craft great software development tools as a sustainable business. Although the mesh-at-large has the opportunity and the leverage to explore alternative organizational structures, we feel that pursuing this within Truffle would be an experiment, as it lies outside our area of expertise and risks being orthogonal to our goals. That being said, ConsenSys\u2019 holocracy along with our own personal experiences with autonomy, transparency, and flat organizations provide powerful sources of inspiration in helping Truffle continue to refine its conception of organization and leadership.Can you walk me through a typical day?Since Truffle is 100% remote, there probably is no good description for a \u201ctypical day.\u201d I (Nick) usually wake up around 8 or 9, spend an hour or so getting settled in, and then proceed to spend my mornings catching up on email/GitHub/etc., and getting a sense for what\u2019s ahead. At 1PM, I meet with Chris (the other engineer working on Truffle) for our standup. We discuss issues and work going on, and then proceed to spend the afternoon as heads-down as possible. I try to finish up my work day by 7 or 8pm, with a long lunch somewhere midday.How do you build rapport and trust on your team?By encouraging everyone to have a voice, by keeping a \u201cbeginner\u2019s mind,\u201d by asking questions, and by recognizing that the craft of engineering software often includes a healthy amount of emotional commitment to our work.How do you decide to roll out new product features?Mostly based on what ideas sound exciting and attainable. We have a roadmap with a substantial backlog, so we try to schedule what\u2019s next based on what will help the community as well as make future tasks easier.Are there any exciting new releases or features you can let the community know about?Truffle v5 is coming soon, and we\u2019re quite excited about what\u2019s in store:Bring your own compiler! Specify whatever Solidity version you want, and Truffle will automatically download it. Or install Solidity yourself natively for something like a ~4x speed improvement.We\u2019re overhauling the migrations system to make it more reliable and more transparent. Truffle will detect problems with your migrations ahead of time and provide clear output that helps users see exactly what\u2019s going on.Upgrade to Web3js 1.0Improvements to the Truffle console (await, anyone?)and more!Where do you see Truffle in the next 5 years? What role will it play in the Ethereum ecosystem? What about the blockchain ecosystem?It\u2019s dangerous to make predictions like that. In 5 years, Truffle will be a mature suite of tools that provide a one-stop-chocolate-shop for smart contract and decentralized application development. Our products already are built on top of each other, and we expect that this relationship will only get stronger \u2014 e.g., Ganache will know about your Truffle projects and provide a GUI for seeing deployed instances, etc. Since the community has been so incredible at building all manners of tools, we expect Truffle to extend this integration even further and allow users to mix-and-match their favorite utilities in an easy-to-use way.How can the community get involved?Continue raising issues in our GitHub, helping each other with support in our Gitter channel, and of course, contributing great PRs.Are you hiring? If yes, for which roles?Truffle is hiring for all our products (Truffle, Ganache, Drizzle), and more! Expect to see job postings soon, as we hope to grow rapidly to keep up with the needs of the community.Big thank you to the Truffle team for all of their hard work in enabling the growth of the Ethereum and open source communities, helping to improve the role of decentralization in society, and empowering developers to achieve their goals. #missionaccomplishedHave a sweet tooth?Check out TruffleCon in Portland, Oregon!Truffle GithubTruffle GitterConnect with me on Linkedin and Twitter!Disclaimer: The views expressed by the author above do not necessarily represent the views of Consensys AG.

Something that I missed when writing the first couple blog post. I jumped right into truffle and solidity and forget to not only list an import prerequisite, but I also forgot to give you the background knowledge that you needed to continue with the tutorials fully.Why was it so easily missed. Well, its was missed because I assumed you were like me and had already amassed that knowledge you needed. But what if you didn\u2019t? What if you just jumped into the blog posts and just powered your way through. You would have a general understanding of how to do things, but you might not really know why your doing it or even why it needs to be done. I always find that its helpful, especially when I\u2019m trying to solve a problem, if I\u2019m able to visualize whats happening in my head and walk through it.So what is this this prerequisite that I\u2019m speaking of? Its the basic understanding of the Blockchain. Being familiar with how it works, why it does certain things, and what steps it takes to get there. As much information as you need to be comfortable with the inner working of the Blockchain. So in this blog post I\u2019m hoping to explain the best I can and maybe along the way I\u2019ll find a bit of knowledge I didn\u2019t know existed by explaining it to you.Since I don\u2019t really know who is reading this or where you currently stand when it comes to understanding the Blockchain. I\u2019m just going to assume you know nothing, you\u2019ve just heard people mention it before, but your not sure how it all comes together, and how do they chain these blocks together (see what they did there).Lets start with the pieces that make up the Blockchain or what we like to call the framework. The Blockchain framework, is made up of 9 different pieces:Blockchain FrameworkNow I want you to take a second, take notice that as we cover those pieces of the framework, we wont being going in the order illustrated above. There is actually a reason for that. That is because I do not think we need to cover them in that order, as that order is more of how the system works together with all the pieces to create the Blockchain pieces and not necessarily the fundamental order of the pieces. So what I want to do is start by quickly going over the fundamental pieces from top to bottom and finish with the harder more complex pieces.Hashing not Hash-taggingWe can start with our first component, which is Hashing. No not hashtag, but hashing. This is something that your going to or have already heard of many times.So what is hashing or a hash value? To put it simply, it\u2019s a unique string of letters and numbers that represent a set of data or if someone asks you at a partyIts a digital fingerprint for information.Great! but what if they ask you how you get a hash value or how is it created. Well its simple (make sure to say that also with a smirk on your face), you just start with some information or data and that gets passed through a hashing function, then the hashing function will make that group of data into to a unique hash value by taking that information you passing in and using it to create a completely unique hash value. There you have it, a unique identifier for your original data.How a hash or hash value is createdBy going through this process it allows us to identify a given set of information much more easily by allowing us to reference its hash value. There are different types of hashing functions used by different types of cryptocurrencie projects. I\u2019ll just list a very few below as the list goes on and on, but I wanted to give you a simple idea of who is using what.Projects and their hashing functionsThe reason why we use a hash is that it allows us to create a unique identifier for every block that exits on the chain. We can now use it to reference a particular block by its hash value or even start to create the foundation in which we can join those blocks together into a chain.Get it? Got it? Good! I wont cover everything in this blog. AS I said, I just wanted to give you an understanding in bit size pieces that allow you to go take the information, think about it, maybe even do some more research on your own and then come back and continue the journey with me. So the final piece that I will cover in this blog post will be blocks. Not to worry, its only for this blog post, there\u2019s still more we can learn to help fully understand the Blockcain framework.Just another day around the BlockWhat would a Blockchain be without blocks? Blocks are literally the building blocks of the entire Blockchain. A block is just a container that holds a list of transactions that are to be added to the Blockchain. I\u2019ll cover Blockchain in more details in the next upcoming posts, but a Blockchain is just a shared digital ledger that records a list of transactions that happen throughout the network. Lets think about this for a minute. If we were to take transaction as just a plain list and let them be recorded forever, we would have a massive list of transactions, top to bottom and that would be a nightmare to work with or manage. So what the Blockchain does is that it splits up the transactions into smaller sections that we call blocks, and this gives us more control over our transactions. These transaction are bundled together as blocks and added to the Blockchain to help manage the entire system more efficiently.What makes a BlockInterestingly enough, not only are transactions stored int the body of a block, but others bits of information are stored in there also. Another piece of that makes up a block, is the block header and this stores other pieces of information that contain details relating to the structure of the data in the block such as:Previous Block Hash \u2014 Connects the block to the previous (parent) block in the chain.Timestamp \u2014 The approximate creation time of this block (seconds from Unix Epoch).Merkle Root \u2014 A hash of the root of the merkle tree of this blocks transactions.Nonce \u2014 A counter used for the proof-of-work algorithm.Although the nounce part of the block header has more to do with mining, there is a bit of information in there that we should probably understand to completely paint this wonderful picture called a block. So to keep things simple, lets put it this way. As I said above the nounce is a counter and has a arbitrary number that can only be used once. When creating a hash for a block, the system requires a very specific hash value, this value starts with a certain amount of zeros. These added values make the hash more difficult to find when mining. In order to get that value you have to combine all the blocks data with the nounce arbitrary number in order to try to generate (the minder does this) correct hash value. Miners will try to solve this problem over and over and over again, until finally one of them comes up with the value that meets this constraint. This is why they call it mining! Miners will try to solve this problem over and over and over again, until finally one of them comes up with the value that meets this constraint. This is why they call it mining! We don\u2019t need to go over it too much right now, we just need to understand how those work. The why will be covered in the future blog posts.Each block has a difficulty level when it comes to mining, this relates to the nounce. The number of zeros that are requested to solve a block determine the difficulty level of a block. The more zeros that are needed, the harder it is to find that block, and the block difficulty goes up, the less zero\u2019s, the easier a block and block difficulty goes down.Block SizeWhat is this thing I keep hearing about block size? Another attribute that a block has is its size. The block size is the amount of space a block has to hold information. Like any pieces of technology that store information, it has its limits when it comes to how much space it has. How the Block size is determined is by the developer(s), and this helps to make decisions like, how many blocks will be on the chain and how long it will take for a block to get full. And this block size is the same for every block on a given Blockchain. With that being said, this can be changed, but only by making updates to the software, or what we know as a fork.Remember the image about where we described data, going into a hashing function and then producing a hash value, a unique fingerprint we can use to identify that block? An important thing to remember about that is, if data changes even slightly, so does the hash value, and create a completely new hash value. So if a transaction changes on the block, so will the hash. This lets everyone know when a block has been tampered with. This piece of secure functionality within the Blockchain is a really secure way of keeping a history of information that we can be sure of hasn\u2019t been tampered with, without us knowing or finding out.Final WordsWhat have we learnt?There are 9 main different pieces that make up a Blockchain framework.Hashing is a unique string of letters and numbers that represent a set of data.A block is just a container that holds a list of transactions that are to be added to the Blockchain.Each block has a difficulty level when it comes to mining.There are different types of hashing functions used by different types of cryptocurrencie projects.That is it for now. In the next posts I\u2019ll continue along the framework and discuss the other pieces that make up the Blockchain Famework.Join the conversation, follow us on Twitter: @Tap_Coin, Reddit, or swing by and have a chat with us on Telegram: https://t.co/eIP47QmZ1E to discuss all things Tap Project.Tap into a world that is more than just gaming!", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Blockchain Technology", "Ethereum", "Bitcoin", "Dapps"]}]
