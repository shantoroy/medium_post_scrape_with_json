Given a couple more hours, the hacker could\u2019ve made off with over $180,000,000 from vulnerable wallets.But someone stopped them.Having sounded the alarm bells, a group of benevolent white-hat hackers from the Ethereum community rapidly organized. They analyzed the attack and realized that there was no way to reverse the thefts, yet many more wallets were vulnerable. Time was of the essence, so they saw only one available option: hack the remaining wallets before the attacker did.By exploiting the same vulnerability, the white-hats hacked all of the remaining at-risk wallets and drained their accounts, effectively preventing the attacker from reaching any of the remaining $150,000,000.Yes, you read that right.To prevent the hacker from robbing any more banks, the white-hats wrote software to rob all of the remaining banks in the world. Once the money was safely stolen, they began the process of returning the funds to their respective account holders. The people who had their money saved by this heroic feat are now in the process of retrieving their funds.It\u2019s an extraordinary story, and it has significant implications for the world of cryptocurrencies.It\u2019s important to understand that this exploit was not a vulnerability in Ethereum or in Parity itself. Rather, it was a vulnerability in the default smart contract code that the Parity client gives the user for deploying multi-signature wallets.This is all pretty complicated, so to make the details of this clear for everyone, this post is broken into three parts:What exactly happened? An explanation of Ethereum, smart contracts, and multi-signature wallets.How did they do it? A technical explanation of the attack (specifically for programmers).What now? The attack\u2019s implications about the future and security of smart contracts.If you are familiar with Ethereum and the crypto world, you can skip to the second section.1. What exactly happened?There are three building blocks to this story: Ethereum, smart contracts, and digital wallets.Ethereum is a digital currency invented in 2013 \u2014 a full 4 years after the release of Bitcoin. It has since grown to be the second largest digital currency in the world by market cap \u2014 $20 billion, compared to Bitcoin\u2019s $40 billion.Like all cryptocurrencies, Ethereum is a descendant of the Bitcoin protocol, and improves on Bitcoin\u2019s design. But don\u2019t be fooled: though it is a digital currency like Bitcoin, Ethereum is much more powerful.While Bitcoin uses its blockchain to implement a ledger of monetary transactions, Ethereum uses its blockchain to record state transitions in a gigantic distributed computer. Ethereum\u2019s corresponding digital currency, ether, is essentially a side effect of powering this massive computer.To put it another way, Ethereum is literally a computer that spans the entire world. Anyone who runs the Ethereum software on their computer is participating in the operations of this world-computer, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Because the EVM was designed to be Turing-complete (ignoring gas limits), it can do almost anything that can be expressed in a computer program.Let me be emphatic: this is crazy stuff. The crypto world is ebullient about the potential of Ethereum, which has seen its value skyrocket in the last 6 months.The developer community has rallied behind it, and there\u2019s a lot of excitement about what can be built on top of the EVM \u2014 and this brings us to smart contracts.Smart contracts are simply computer programs that run on the EVM. In many ways, they are like normal contracts, except they don\u2019t need lawyers or judges to interpret them. Instead, they are compiled to bytecode and interpreted unambiguously by the EVM. With these programs, you can (among other things) programmatically transfer digital currency based solely on the rules of the contract code.Of course, there are things normal contracts do that smart contracts can\u2019t \u2014 smart contracts can\u2019t easily interact with things that aren\u2019t on the blockchain. But smart contracts can also do things that normal contracts can\u2019t, such as enforce a set of rules entirely through unbreakable cryptography.This leads us to the notion of wallets. In the world of digital currencies, wallets are how you store your assets. You gain access to your wallet using essentially a secret password, also known as your private key (simplified a bit).There are many different types of wallets that confer different security properties, such as withdrawal limits. One of the most popular types is the multi-signature wallet.In a multi-signature wallet, there are several private keys that can unlock the wallet, but just one key is not enough to unlock it. If your multi-signature wallet has 3 keys, for example, you can specify that at least 2 of the 3 keys must be provided to successfully unlock it.This means that if you, your father, and your mother are each signatories on this wallet, even if a criminal hacked your mother and stole her private key, they could still not access your funds. This leads to much stronger security guarantees, so multi-sigs are a standard in wallet security.This is the type of wallet the hacker attacked.So what went wrong? Did they break the private keys? Did they use a quantum computer, or some kind of cutting-edge factoring algorithm?Nope, all the cryptography was sound. The exploit was almost laughably simple: they found a programmer-introduced bug in the code that let them re-initialize the wallet, almost like restoring it to factory settings. Once they did that, they were free to set themselves as the new owners, and then walk out with everything.2. How did this happen?What follows is a technical explanation of exactly what happened. If you\u2019re not a developer, feel free to skip to the next section, since this is going to be programming-heavy.Ethereum has a fairly unique programming model. On Ethereum, you write code by publishing contracts (which you can think of as objects), and transactions are executed by calling methods on these objects to mutate their state.In order to run code on Ethereum, you need to first deploy the contract (the deployment is itself a transaction), which costs a small amount of Ether. You then need to call methods on the contract to interact with it, which costs more Ether. As you can imagine, this incentivizes a programmer to optimize their code, both to minimize transactions and minimize computation costs.One way to reduce costs is to use libraries. By making your contract call out to a shared library that was deployed at a previous time, you don\u2019t have to re-deploy any shared code. In Ethereum, keeping your code DRY will directly save you money.The default multi-sig wallet in Parity did exactly this. It held a reference to a shared external library which contained wallet initialization logic. This shared library is referenced by the public key of the library contract.// FIELDSaddress constant _walletLibrary = 0xa657491c1e7f16adb39b9b60e87bbb8d93988bc3;The library is called in several places, via an EVM instruction called DELEGATECALL, which does the following: for whatever method that calls DELEGATECALL, it will call the same method on the contract you're delegating to, but using the context of the current contract. It's essentially like a super call, except without the inheritance part. (The equivalent in JavaScript would be OtherClass.functionName.apply(this, args).)Here\u2019s an example of this in their multi-sig wallet: the isOwner method just delegates to the shared wallet library's isOwner method, using the current contract's state:function isOwner(address _addr) constant returns (bool) {    return _walletLibrary.delegatecall(msg.data);}This is all innocent enough. The multi-sig wallet itself contained all of the right permission checks, and they were sure to rigorously enforce authorization on all sensitive actions related to the wallet\u2019s state.But they made one critical mistake.Solidity allows you to define a \u201cfallback method.\u201d This is the method that gets called when there\u2019s no method that matches a given method name. You define it by not giving it a name:function() {    // do stuff here for all unknown methods}The Parity team decided to let any unknown method that sent Ether to the contract just default to depositing the sent Ether.function() payable {    // payable is just a keyword that means this method can receive/pay Etherif (msg.value > 0) {    // just being sent some cash?    Deposit(msg.sender, msg.value);    } else {    throw;  }}But they took it a step further, and herein was their critical mistake. Below is the actual code that was attacked.function() payable {    // just being sent some cash?  if (msg.value > 0)    Deposit(msg.sender, msg.value);  else if (msg.data.length > 0)    _walletLibrary.delegatecall(msg.data);}Basically:If the method name is not defined on this contract\u2026And there\u2019s no ether being sent in the transaction\u2026And there is some data in the message payload\u2026Then it will call the exact same method if it\u2019s defined in _walletLibrary, but in the context of this contract.Using this, the attacker called a method called initWallet(), which was not defined on the multisig contract but was defined in the shared wallet library:function initWallet(address[] _owners, uint _required, uint _daylimit) {    initDaylimit(_daylimit);  initMultiowned(_owners, _required);}Which calls the initMultiowned method...function initMultiowned(address[] _owners, uint _required) {    m_numOwners = _owners.length + 1;  m_owners[1] = uint(msg.sender);  m_ownerIndex[uint(msg.sender)] = 1;  for (uint i = 0; i < _owners.length; ++i)  {    m_owners[2 + i] = uint(_owners[i]);    m_ownerIndex[uint(_owners[i])] = 2 + i;  }  m_required = _required;}Do you see what just happened there? The attacker essentially reinitialized the contract by delegating through the library method, overwriting the owners on the original contract. They and whatever array of owners they supply as arguments will be the new owners.Given that they now control the entire wallet, they can trivially extract the remainder of the balance. And that\u2019s precisely what they did.The initWallet: https://etherscan.io/tx/0x707aabc2f24d756480330b75fb4890ef6b8a26ce0554ec80e3d8ab105e63db07The transfer: https://etherscan.io/tx/0x9654a93939e98ce84f09038b9855b099da38863b3c2e0e04fd59a540de1cb1e5So what was ultimately the vulnerability? You could argue there were two. First, the initWallet and initMultiowned in the wallet library were not marked as internal (this is like a private method, which would prevent this delegated call), and those methods did not check that the wallet wasn't already initialized. Either check would've made this hack impossible.The second vulnerability was the raw delegateCall. You can think of this as equivalent to a raw eval statement, running on a user-supplied string. In an attempt to be succinct, this contract used metaprogramming to proxy potential method calls to an underlying library. The safer approach here would be to whitelist specific methods that the user is allowed to call.The trouble, of course, is that this is more expensive in gas costs (since it has to evaluate more conditionals). But when it comes to security, we probably have to get over this concern when writing smart contracts that move massive amounts of money.So that was the attack.It was a clever catch, but once you point it out, it seems almost elementary. The attacker then jumped on this vulnerability for three of the largest wallets they could find \u2014 but judging from the transaction times, they were doing this entirely manually.The white-hat group was doing this at scale using scripts, and that\u2019s why they were able to beat the attacker to the punch. Given this, it\u2019s unlikely that the attacker was very sophisticated in how they planned their attack.You might ask the question though \u2014 why don\u2019t they just roll back this hack, like they did with the DAO hack?Unfortunately that\u2019s not really possible. The DAO hack was unique in that when the attacker drained the DAO into a child DAO, the funds were frozen for many days inside a smart contract before they could be released to the attacker.This prevented any of the stolen funds from going into circulation, so the stolen Ether was effectively siloed. This gave the Ethereum community plenty of time to conduct a public quorum about how to deal with the attack.In this attack, the attacker immediately stole the funds and could start spending them. A hard fork would be impractical\u2013what do you do about all of the transactions that occur downstream? What about the people who innocently traded assets with the attacker? Once the ether they\u2019ve stolen gets laundered and enters general circulation, it\u2019s like counterfeit bills circulating in the economy \u2014 it\u2019s easy to stop when it\u2019s all in one briefcase, but once everyone\u2019s potentially holding a counterfeit bill, you can\u2019t really turn back the clock anymore.So the transaction won\u2019t get reversed. The $31M loss stands. It\u2019s a costly, but necessary lesson.So what should we take away from this?3. What does this attack mean for Ethereum?There are several important takeaways here.First, remember, this was not a flaw in Ethereum or in smart contracts in general. Rather, it was a developer error in a particular contract.So who were the crackpot developers who wrote this? They should\u2019ve known better, right?The developers here were a cross-collaboration between the Ethereum foundation (literally the creators of Ethereum), the Parity core team, and members of the open-source community. It underwent extensive peer review. This is basically the highest standard of programming that exists in the Ethereum ecosystem.These developers were human. They made a mistake. And so did the reviewers who audited this code.I\u2019ve read some comments on Reddit and HackerNews along the lines of: \u201cWhat an obvious mistake! How was it even possible they missed this?\u201d (Ignoring that the \u201cobvious\u201d vulnerability was introduced in January and only now discovered.)When I see responses like this, I know the people commenting are not professional developers. For a serious developer, the reaction is instead: damn, that was a dumb mistake. I\u2019m glad I wasn\u2019t the one who made it.Mistakes of this sort are routinely made in programming. All programs carry the risk of developer error. We have to throw off the mindset of \u201cif they were just more careful, this wouldn\u2019t have happened.\u201d At a certain scale, carefulness is not enough.As programs scale to non-trivial complexity, you have to start taking it as a given that programs are probably not correct. No amount of human diligence or testing is sufficient to prevent all possible bugs. Even organizations like Google or NASA make programming mistakes, despite the extreme rigor they apply to their most critical code.We would do well to take a page from site reliability practices at companies like Google and Airbnb. Whenever there\u2019s a production bug or outage, they do a postmortem analysis and distribute it within the company. In these postmortems, there is always a principle of never blaming individuals.Blaming mistakes on individuals is pointless, because all programmers, no matter how experienced, have a nonzero likelihood of making a mistake. Instead, the purpose of a postmortem is to identify what in the process allowed that mistake to get deployed.The problem was not that the developer forgot to add internal to the wallet library, or that they did a raw delegateCall without checking what method was being called.The problem is that their programming toolchain allowed them to make these mistakes.As the smart contract ecosystem evolves, it has to evolve in the direction of making these mistakes harder, and that means making contracts secure by default.This leads me to my next point.Strength is a weakness when it comes to programming languages. The stronger and more expressive a programming language is, the more complex its code becomes. Solidity is a very complex language, modeled to resemble Java.Complexity is the enemy of security. Complex programs are more difficult to reason about and harder to identify edge cases for. I think that languages like Viper (maintained by Vitalik Buterin) are a promising step in this direction. Viper includes by default basic security mechanisms, such as bounded looping constructs, no integer overflows, and prevents other basic bugs that developers shouldn\u2019t have to reason about.The less the language lets you do, the easier it is to analyze and prove properties of a contract. Security is hard because the only way to prove a positive statement like \u201cthis contract is secure\u201d is to disprove every possible attack vector: \u201cthis contract cannot be re-initialized,\u201d \u201cits funds cannot be accessed except by the owners,\u201d etc. The fewer possible attack vectors you have to consider, the easier it is to develop a secure contract.A simpler programming model also allows things like formal verification and automatic test generation. These are areas under active research, but just as smart contracts have incorporated cutting-edge cryptography, they also should start incorporating the leading edge of programming language design.There is a bigger lesson here too.Most of the programmers who are getting into this space, myself included, come from a web development background, and the blockchain toolchain is designed to be familiar for web developers. Solidity has achieved tremendous adoption in the developer community because of its familiarity to other forms of programming. In a way, this may end up being its downfall.The problem is, blockchain programming is fundamentally different from web development.Let me explain.Before the age of the client-server web model, most programming was done for packaged consumer software or on embedded systems. This was before the day of automatic software updates. In these programs, a shipped product was final \u2014 you released one form of your software every 6 months, and if there was a bug, that bug would have to stand until the next release. Because of this longer development cycle, all software releases were rigorously tested under all conceivable circumstances.Web development is far more forgiving. When you push bad code to a web server, it\u2019s not a big deal if there\u2019s a critical mistake \u2014 you can just roll back the code, or roll forward with a fix, and all is well because you control the server. Or if the worst happens and there\u2019s an active breach or a data leak, you can always stop the bleeding by shutting off your servers and disconnecting yourself from the network.These two development models are fundamentally different. It\u2019s only out of something like web development that you can get the motto \u201cmove fast and break things.\u201dMost programmers today are trained on the web development model. Unfortunately, the blockchain security model is more akin to the older model.In blockchain, code is intrinsically unrevertible. Once you deploy a bad smart contract, anyone is free to attack it as long and hard as they can, and there\u2019s no way to take it back if they get to it first. Unless you build intelligent security mechanisms into your contracts, if there\u2019s a bug or successful attack, there\u2019s no way to shut off your servers and fix the mistake. Being on Ethereum by definition means everyone owns your server.A common saying in cybersecurity is \u201cattack is always easier than defense.\u201d Blockchain sharply multiplies this imbalance. It\u2019s far easier to attack because you have access to the code of every contract, know how much money is in it, and can take as long as you want to try to attack it. And once your attack is successful, you can potentially steal all of the money in the contract.Imagine that you were deploying software for vending machines. But instead of a bug allowing you to simply steal candy from one machine, the bug allowed you to simultaneously steal candy from every machine in the world that employed this software. Yeah, that\u2019s how blockchain works.In the case of a successful attack, defense is extremely difficult. The white-hats in the Parity hack demonstrated how limited their defense options were \u2014 there was no way to secure or dismantle the contracts, or even to hack back the stolen money; all they could do was hack the remaining vulnerable contracts before the attacker did.This might seem to spell a dark future.But I don\u2019t think this is a death knell for blockchain programming. Rather, it confirms what everyone already knows: this ecosystem is young and immature. It\u2019s going to take a lot of work to develop the training and discipline to treat smart contracts the way that banks treat their ATM software. But we\u2019re going to have to get there for blockchain to be successful in the long run.This means not just programmers maturing and getting more training. It also means developing tools and languages that make all of this easier, and give us rigorous guarantees about our code.It\u2019s still early. Ethereum is a work in progress, and it\u2019s changing rapidly. You should not treat Ethereum as a bank or as a replacement for financial infrastructure. And certainly you should not store any money in a hot wallet that you\u2019re not comfortable losing.But despite all that, I still think Ethereum is going to win in the long run. And here\u2019s why: the developer community in Ethereum is what makes it so powerful.Ethereum will not live or die because of the money in it. It will live or die based on the developers who are fighting for it.The league of white-hats who came together and defended the vulnerable wallets didn\u2019t do it for money. They did it because they believe in this ecosystem. They want Ethereum to thrive. They want to see their vision of the future come true. And after all the speculation and the profiteering, it\u2019s ultimately these people who are going to usher the community into its future. They are fundamentally why Ethereum will win in the long run\u2014or if they abandon Ethereum, their abandonment will be why it loses.This attack is important. It will shake people up. It will force the community to take a long, hard look at security best practices. It will force developers to treat smart contract programming with far more rigor than they currently do.But this attack hasn\u2019t shaken the strength of the builders who are working on this stuff. So in that sense it\u2019s a temporary setback.In the end, attacks like this are good for the community to grow up. They call you to your senses and force you to keep your eyes open. It hurts, and the press will likely make a mess of the story. But every wound makes the community stronger, and gets us closer to really deeply understanding the technology of blockchain \u2014 both its dangers, and its amazing potential.P.S. If you\u2019re a dev and you want to learn more about smart contract security, this is a really good resource.Errata: This article originally said that Gavin Wood was the developer of the contract, which is incorrect. Gavin is the founder of Parity and pushed the fix to the contract, but was not the original developer. It also originally claimed that $77M additional funds were vulnerable, but this doesn\u2019t count all of the ERC20 (ICO) tokens that were vulnerable. The total amount is actually $150,000,000+ if you include all ERC20 tokens. As of the time of writing this (July 21st 4PM EST), the total value of the assets saved by the white-hats was $179,704,659.", "responses": 152, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Blockchain", "Security", "Technology", "Startup"]}, {"title": "What does $100 Ether mean?", "post_link": "https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/what-does-ether-100-mean-bb58522f781e?source=search_post---------1", "author_name": "Vinay Gupta", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@leashless", "publish_date": "2017-05-05", "last_modified_date": "2018-11-20", "readtime": "18.0", "claps": 2512, "voters": 1292, "content": "What does $100 Ether mean?Vinay GuptaFollowMay 5, 2017 \u00b7 19 min readToday, Ether hit $100 (may 2017, when this piece was written. update: it\u2019s $300 now, five weeks later. update: it\u2019s worth $132 now, 18 months later. you see how this goes). I\u2019m sure by the time you\u2019re reading this it will be in The Guardian and the New York Times as a curiosity piece. Our market cap will approach thirty billion dollars. By all and any standards, this is a success beyond anything dreamt of when the project started, and the money raised will continue to finance technical innovation for years to come. While the impact and worth of a technology cannot be measured by money alone, on this occasion, celebration is appropriate. We have done well.For those of you who are new to the Ethereum show, let me explain what has just happened.Two years ago, I wrote Programmable Blockchains In Context, the Ethereum launch post. It was a huge success, sat on the front page of Hacker News for a day, and really set the conversation and tone around the Ethereum project, without over-promising. I\u2019ve learned a few things about explaining Ethereum now, and it\u2019s not exactly what I would have written with hindsight, but it\u2019s close enough that if you want the full depth chapter-and-verse on this new technology, that\u2019s where you\u2019d go. If you need more depth, the Ethereum Whitepaper by Vitalik Buterin, our leader, is still an absolute marvel of clarity and deep thinking. But assuming you are a more general reader, let me explain briefly what the technology is, so we can talk meaningfully about what $100 Ether means.Ethereum is a programmable blockchain. It was created by a small team built by Vitalik Buterin, who was (at the time the project started) famously young \u2014 a CEO of a 20 person team with $18m of bitcoin in the \u201cbank.\u201d Many members of that team are remarkable in their own right: Joe Lubin who went from Wall St. to found Consensys Systems, a major New York company building out the blockchain future. Dr Gavin Wood, of Parity, a truly remarkable computer scientist. Dr Jutta Steiner, also of Parity. It grew into a large team, made of remarkable people, and I\u2019m just namechecking a few. Over the couple of years the project took, the team grew, fragmented, splintered, reunited, forged ahead. The first year, the year before I joined, is truly the stuff of legends.Anyway, that\u2019s the cultural context. A 20 year old kid and a bunch of funny-looking villains pull together this remarkable piece of technology which, at the time, we thought was going to change the world, and now it has.So what does it do, this programmable blockchain that\u2019s worth ten billion dollars? Well, let me explain. A blockchain is a way of arranging a lot of computers together to do the same thing. It\u2019s a bit like Dropbox or Google Docs or any other syncing technology that moves pictures from your phone to your laptop or whatever. The difference is that it\u2019s syncing thousand and thousands of computers. If a few machines drop offline or get hacked, the network does not even notice: the consensus of all the machines which have the same data overwhelms the occasional drop outs. The computers form a choir, and they never forget the chorus.This blockchain has two remarkable features. The first is the way that it pays for all those computers. On the head end of the blockchain there is a sort of roulette wheel. Five times a minute, the wheel gets a spin, and one of the computers which is helping to run the blockchain gets a prize of 5 Ether. This award is noted down in the blockchain, and synced to all of the computers in the system. The lucky winner can transfer this ether to another person (identified by their cryptographic code address) in exchange for, say, goods, services \u2014 or cash.So this hundred dollars per Ether price that you see, that\u2019s $500 every twelve seconds, $2500 a minute, $3.6 million dollars per day pouring out of cyberspace into the pockets of those lucky enough to have computers helping to run and sync the blockchain \u2014 the computer system which stores their winnings is paying for itself by issuing those winnings. It\u2019s a perfect self-generating system, just like Bitcoin was before it. So that\u2019s where the money is coming from, should you be too embarrassed to ask! For historical reasons, they call this process \u201cmining.\u201dThe second property of this programmable blockchain is even more remarkable. Programmability is a funny thing: when a system does a simple job, like Bitcoin (which has more or less the same mining dynamics as I outlined above for Ether) it\u2019s easy to understand, easy to secure. But you add some element of programming to the thing \u2014 not just coins are mined and exchanged, but somehow this whole thing is software too? Well, that\u2019s where things get complicated.Ethereum incorporates Smart Contracts. Smart Contracts are the reason I came back into this kind of work, more than two decades after I\u2019d been exposed to the original ideas on the Cipherpunks mailing list all those years ago. I\u2019d left the field, only dipping back now and again to keep my perspective fresh, but when I heard a smart contract ecosystem was being built, it pulled me back out of my retirement from matters cryptographic. I came running.A smart contract is a tool for changing the world. We have this mental model of all these computers synced together. Now imagine that rather than syncing a transaction: 5 Ether go to Bob in the reward lottery, or 22 Ether go to Helen from Fred\u2019s account, we do something else. What is this something else? We sync software. I upload a program \u2014 needfully small, because it\u2019s going to thousands of other machines \u2014 and we secure that syncing process using all the same sync-and-mining approaches taken to cash-only blockchain like Bitcoin\u2019s.Every machine in the network runs the same small program. It could be something simple, like a loan: I send you some money, and your account automatically pays it back, with interest, a few days later. If you can\u2019t pay, a third party covers your debts, and it\u2019s all locked in at the start \u2014 your consent, my consent, and their consent. We all agree to these terms, and it\u2019s locked in using the smart contract. We have achieved programmable money. You might say that this doesn\u2019t sound very complicated or impressive, but just wait and see where this goes.What kinds of things can you do with programmable money? Nearly the entire financial system is built from programmable money. They don\u2019t call it that, of course, but the loans and bonds and derivatives and futures and mortgages and credit default swaps and all the rest? Although at the very bottom of the stack, right in the guts of the system they might eventually be represented by a paper contract, in fact they\u2019re represented as software for almost every step in their evolution. An individual mortgage might be a paper contract between a person and a bank, but a hundred million mortgages in the mortgage system are pure digital: software representing homes, offices, warehouses, cars, land \u2014 and more ephemeral items like airline tickets and concert tickets and even the music itself in a digital download. All of this, and more, is just software representing value, programmable money singing its songs of desire and achievement across the wires.In short, programmable money builds the world. And Ethereum is new programmable money.Now, as a new system, Ethereum is a little crude. Probably the longest smart contract in current use is about 2000 lines, and that\u2019s compared to around 6 million lines of code for the F35 warplane. These are little baby steps: enough to implement a simple bond, but maybe not all the super complicated contingency management that you might get in a real paper bond contract. But in the pure digital world of the blockchain, the vast majority of the things which can go wrong with a bond in the messy real world just can\u2019t happen. So there\u2019s a tradeoff \u2014 simpler, kind of abstract systems which work inside of this blockchain universe, which lack the sophistication of the main financial system, versus the big old clunky machinery which occasionally runs into crises like not being able to find mortgage paperwork when house repossessions roll around during an economic contraction, because the mortgages were being moved between banks carelessly. It\u2019s early days on this new frontier, and we are still in the trial-and-error phase of blockchain developments \u2014 we don\u2019t know the best way to use the power of these amazing new tools, but the hundreds of prototypes done by big companies and banks make it pretty clear what the general consensus is: this tech is going somewhere.The last piece of general magic we need to consider is this. Every bank has its own ferociously complex, and incredibly expensive and usually very delicate, computer system for managing all of the bank\u2019s assets \u2014 the customer accounts (your money!), the bank\u2019s assets (your house!) and all of its complex obligations to regulators, to other banks, and so on. The whole bank is in there: the bank is the software, and the software is the bank.And the financial system is made of tens of thousands of these institutions all networked using crude, old, unreliable computer systems in many cases. Technical processes are slow, as anybody who\u2019s ever sent a wire transfer will attest. Systems are inscrutable: when you hit a problem with your bank, it\u2019s you who has the problem. Accountability is slow, and often painful to extract.But the blockchain is different. Every one of those thousands of machines we referred to earlier, running their copy of the blockchain software, is a full peer. Each one carries with it all the transactions in the system, and each node can \u2014 as long as the software can carry the tune \u2014 run it\u2019s own code. Systems like Bitcoin or Ethereum have many, many implementations. As long as they can all smoothly work together (and bugs at this level are, indeed, very rare) the whole thing works like a single machine. That nobody owns.That nobody owns!There is no \u201cBitcoin Corporation\u201d or \u201cEthereum Incorporated.\u201d There are some charities which help write the software, but the actual networks are not run by anybody, any more than the internet itself is run by somebody. The full peers, the computers which make up the network, are all owned by different people. They interact in pretty much the same way that computers interact when they are passing along email or other messages \u2014 a message can flow over dozens or hundreds of other computers before it reaches your mailbox, and those machines can be owned and run by almost anybody. The nature of the internet is that it is a network of networks: nobody owns the entire thing, everybody owns and manages their own piece, from your laptop and your cellphone, through to the local area network that manages your machines at work, up to the big fibre line installations done by AT&T. Nobody owns the internet, and we get along just fine.So to recap, this crazy little system that was launched only a couple of years ago, that mines its own currency through a strange lottery system, that stores little programs which represent financial instruments or games of chance or skill \u2014 or whatever programmers want them to represent \u2014 this little system is trading at $100 per ether, or nearly $10 billion dollars?Yes.Now let\u2019s try to understand why.Bitcoin is Ethereum\u2019s parent. It\u2019s a bigger, older, surly beast, much beloved by non-State anarchists and American libertarians. It was built on a promise of issuing a sort of digital gold, a central bank of the internet, a new reserve currency backed by pure mathematics. It was intended to be fully decentralized, with all that tricky \u201cmining\u201d work we talked about before done on everybody\u2019s home laptops, scattered all over the world for security.In practice Bitcoin has fallen a fair bit short of that. The mining thing rapidly centralized in the hands of a relatively small number of miners, and the initial hard line Libertarian position softened as taxes needed to be collected and paid, and the original bold vision came up rather short in contact with cold reality. But this was not to say that Bitcoin was a failure in any way, shape or form: the ideas behind Bitcoin certainly ran into trouble as they encountered regulation, but the actual technology and all-important community adoption soldiered right on. Tonight, while Ether passes the $100 barrier, Bitcoin hovers around $1700 for a total of more than four times Ethereum\u2019s total market value. Bitcoin is also succeeding. It\u2019s being used for buying coffee, buying pot (notoriously, on the dark markets), and making international money transfers for bargain basement prices. It\u2019s the face which launched a thousand ships (altcoins), some of which have also recently broken the billion dollar total coin value threshold. Bitcoin enables trade, as simple as that, and understood in these terms is an unmitigated success.Ethereum never had that kind of clarity of political purpose. The team tended towards a mild left-green bias, that I might unfairly summarize as \u201cradicalized Guardian readers\u201d with, of course, a few outliers. I certainly fit that description. The general bias of the project has always been to get things done, and let the future figure out what the tools are for. We talk about decentralization, perhaps as a proxy for freedom or at least economic freedom, and we think the ownerless nature of the network is inherently a good breeding ground for democratic ideals. But there probably isn\u2019t, and never was, a single coherent political ideology behind Ethereum.Rather, there\u2019s a vision about the future of society and global trade. I\u2019m going to try and articulate that vision for you now.Right now, when a group of people want to get something done, usually they put somebody in charge. That person is sometimes a leader, and sometimes a facilitator. The facilitators are theoretically neutral parties which are just there to get the job done, on behalf of the people they serve. They should be, ideally, neutral functionaries. The leaders we pay to have informed opinions which are better than our own ideas, but the facilitators we pay to be neutral voices. But in practice these facilitators are often so powerful that they apply pressure to the whole of society, and in fact often step in and usurp the jobs which should be left to leaders: corporate lobbyists pushing agendas on our elected officials, for instance. The result is a world in which nearly any organization which truly enjoys economies of scale \u2014 from a national grid through to Wal-Mart \u2014 will tend to reconfigure the environment in ways which make it more profitable. We create these giants in the name of efficiently serving our needs, but they wind up ruling over us as if we had elected them with every dollar of our spending.I believe the Ethereum vision of the future of the human race is different. Rather than constantly being hassled by our intermediaries \u2014 from Google through to the Department of Motor Vehicles \u2014 the idea is to disintermediate and deal directly with our neighbours and friends and strangers alike, to get the job done ourselves. Some people called this disintermediation \u2014 a direct relationship between two people without a middleman. But I think the correct emphasis is not on what we are taking away (the intermediaries) but on what we are creating: direct communications between people, which are capable of storing and transmitting economic value.Now that is a bit of a mouthful, so let me break that down to the basics.We have this programmable blockchain. It\u2019s a computer system made up of lots of computers scattered all over the world. Different people own those computers. Different software runs on those computers. But all these people, machines and software collaborate to create a secure system which generates value in the form of digital tokens called Ether. People can transfer value and make simple contracts on this machine made from so many diverse elements.Some would call this system disintermediated. But I prefer to think of it as direct. Yes, there is an intermediary between you and I if we trade on this system: in fact there are many intermediaries \u2014 every miner, every person writing the software, and all the internet providers and so on along the way. But, unlike the banking system, the intermediary in the Ethereum universe has no agenda: it doesn\u2019t make policy. It doesn\u2019t make rules. It doesn\u2019t surprise you with unexpected fees. It doesn\u2019t change the rules of the game between you kicking the ball and it arriving in the goal. The intermediary in Ethereum is transparent: it simply serves to carry out your will, your instructions.And this is the core vision of the Ethereum community: a world in which two people can deal directly with each other, and the systems that support their interaction don\u2019t distort the message as they carry out our instructions. You say what you want, and the machines carry your instructions to the person on the other end of the deal. Directness is the real fruit of disintermediation: people dealing as they would face-to-face, but with the benefit of a network.I went to Norway recently, and I suggested at a talk I did that we could move Scandinavia very quickly to experiments involving a blockchain for payments, fully supported by their government, on the basis that taxation could be built directly into the platforms they might use (it\u2019s unlikely, today, the Norwegian government could collect taxes in Ether not Kroner!). In a system like this, the social contract of the country would be represented directly in the medium-of-exchange: a 15% cut to run a welfare state and provide world class healthcare to everybody is as natural to that environment as a fully-transparent end-to-end system with zero taxes feels to Libertarians. The precise configuration of your payment systems implements your social values, and this is an enormous lesson for all of us: there is no neutral medium, only one that shares your values, which you then perceive as neutral.So here we are, at (or perhaps just slightly under) $100 USD per Ether. I promised you I would tell you what it means.It means that enough people are rallying around this vision of the future, and putting their money on the line for it, that the core development teams and entrepreneurs building that future will be funded more-or-less indefinitely. It means that there\u2019s a massive wave of product innovation as people try to figure out how to get the millions of Ethereum users to spend their money on our products, and that evolutionary process builds further into the potential that the Ethereum system has to satisfy real human needs and desires. The system is learning to take care of us. Without arbitrary interference by middlemen, it may be quite a rapid adaptation.On a personal note, I pushed very deep into the theory around Ethereum and Direct Trade (Decentralization) since Ethereum launched. I came back with three fundamental results.The Dubai Blockchain Strategy which set one of the most innovative nation states in the world on a new track relative to this technology, which was then backed up in Dubai by a second piece of work (in collaboration with Consensys),The Internet of Agreements, which I\u2019ll discuss more below, which pulls together many of the loose threads in the Decentralization discussion into an easier-to-express whole.The Harvard Business Review pieces, which expand in many directions, including Globalization 2.0 (blockchains to protect world trade during deglobalization) and a rather wonderful (unpublished!) piece on Leapfrogging to blockchains in the developing world.No ICO, and no blockchain startup (per se) for me. Why not?I decided, on close examination, that the weakest link in the ecosystem was the willingness of broader society and mass culture to pull us into the mainstream. While I could be deep in the tent doing financial architecture or designing business models for new ICO projects, where I wanted to be was on the periphery, perceived as being \u201cin the real world,\u201d building on ramps for blockchain projects to break out of the microculture they currently exist in, and get all the way into the mainstream. I\u2019ve supported quite a few projects from mostly behind the scenes, though.I\u2019ve also built up a very, very solid stack of theory which is being packaged as concepts like the Internet of Agreements. I hope this framing of our work will stick to the mainstream and make it far, far easier for us to build this future together with the main productive forces in society (rather than being set up in false opposition to them \u2014 the worst mistake that Bitcoin made!)I phrase it like this:In the beginning there was the Internet of Ideas, back before\u2026Online credit card processing gives birth to Amazon and the Internet of ShoppingBlockchains bring the rest of our financial instruments online beside the credit card, giving rise to the Internet of Agreements. The internet finally gets a native representation for deals that is better than emailing PDFs back and forwards.The Internet of Agreements is a pretty simple concept: two (or more) people negotiate a business deal. There\u2019s a computer in the room, a bit like Amazon\u2019s Alexa, to take notes. When it\u2019s pretty sure a deal has been done, it displays the terms to the participants to fine tune, and if they agree, a smart contract is prepared which reflects those terms. Of course that\u2019s an AI problem, and a hard one. This part is a little futuristic. But I want to look forwards about 10 years, and in that time frame, all this seems possible. And of course, on the back end, robots and self-driving cars and automated warehouses and factories do the majority of the work. I think this kind of relationship between us and our machines is more-or-less inevitable. I think of this as a picture of what it will all turn into when it grows up, much like Ted Nelson\u2019s concept of Hypertext guided internet development for many, many years. To me, the Internet of Agreements is a simple image of where we are going, and is a vision we can all get behind. Almost nobody disagrees with the Internet of Agreements as a goal, and it seems to meet the inevitable curve of both technology and society.The Internet of Agreements gave me what I was looking for: a largely technologically-neutral and politically-agnostic goal state. It\u2019s naive to say that politics don\u2019t matter \u2014 they do, they\u2019re vital. But at a 10 year horizon it\u2019s so difficult to imagine how things will be, and debates of today will be seem long-settled by then. Important technical hurdles remain, including Proof of Stake and the entire Scaled Blockchain debate. I don\u2019t know, and I don\u2019t want to second guess, exactly which technological solutions will work out best: Ethereum must speed up, but I don\u2019t want to specify exactly how I see that happening, because I am unsure. I wanted something that I could drive towards that was simple enough it could be explained casually, broad enough that most of our emerging technologies in trade facilitation could fit in somewhere, and far enough away that nobody was going to argue too much about the precise details. In short, I wanted a vision. Not a road map of the next two or three years, looking at lightning networks and snarks, but out 10 years, out when all is said and done.I think Ether at $100 means that so many people believe in the world they think Ethereum will create, that it is becoming inevitable. I suspect that the full implementation of that vision will be a lot more humane and user-friendly than most of what people are thinking about right now, and I suspect that a settlement of the issues around nation state law and smart contracts will be settled by automated compliance checking (i.e. smart contract testing by regulatory oracles) rather than by wholescale end-runs around democratic sovereignty in favor of libertarian ideals. I don\u2019t know that for a fact, but that guess is also built into the Internet of Agreements model of the world.Regardless of how the technological details are worked out, I am more convinced than ever that the smart contract ecosystem is here to stay, because people want it, they need it, and it solves problems they face regularly. It may well be used by ordinary people 50 times a day without ever realizing they have touched it. The coffee is hot and waiting for you when you arrive in the coffee shop, your lunch has a picture of the person who caught the tuna with a fishing line printed on the side, the solar panels are gleaming in the sun, and the computers are matching the supply to demand at the right price. That\u2019s the vision of the smart contract world: stuff just works, because the computers just work. And that\u2019s what we are building now.So right now I\u2019m at the next frontier. I\u2019m building a new set of concepts, called Humanizing the Singularity, to help us navigate these tricky waters. That\u2019s similar to the work I did on explaining Ethereum and teaching people ways to explain it. The Internet of Agreements and Globalization 2.0 explain the blockchain and associated futures in a simple, easy to deal with package. Later this year, Autumn, we will have a big Internet of Agreements conference to push the field further, really pushing on bridge building between blockchain and AI, and blockchain and advanced logistics solutions. Shortly after that there\u2019ll be a paper or two on AR/VR, and an attempt to make sense of that field in a way that lets people get to grips with it faster. Then in 2018 there will be the long-time-coming strategy on AI. The blockchain weaves through all of these areas, like the internet itself, giving persistence to virtual property, flagging ownership of drones or robots, and giving AI problem solving a way to interact with the real world.Now, a final word on the ICO situation.I\u2019ve always tried, often unsuccessfully, to be a voice of conscience in the Ethereum community. Right now I see a lot of very good ideas attracting huge amounts of funding very fast, and that\u2019s great. And if that was all that was happening, that would be great. But the more of a mess people are making with legal shoddiness, technical ineptitude or carelessness, and improper handling of investor interests or identities, the worse the mess is going to be if it all has to be untangled. If this ecosystem is to stabilize, it will be because people ran a tight ship, did exactly what they promised to do, got the details right, dealt sensibly with regulation where applicable, and gave good value for hard-earned cash. I want to sound that note of caution now: I was right to feel uneasy about the original DAO, and did not speak out loudly enough. Self-governing is good, but it must be maintained at the highest standards of ethical integrity to hold up in the long run.Much as I\u2019d like to raise $100m in 24 minutes in an ICO to re-invest in building out the core technologies to connect Ethereum to everything else, I just can\u2019t see a way of doing it that gives us the flexibility down the line to make the decisions we need to. So I\u2019ve started a very conventional venture capital firm to build these technologies, and others. I hope to see you further down the line!

It was put together in a few hours on Friday night and it puts into words some things I\u2019ve been thinking about lately. The ideas explored here are much more fleshed out than they were initially, but I still feel they are in the \u201cseedling\u201d stage of ideation and implementation. I welcome all comments on what I\u2019ve shared here to help me expand my thinking and force the idea to become more robust. :)As the title suggests, I\u2019m going to talk a bit about why the future of Ethereum doesn\u2019t have wallets.Now this may seem a bit odd, seeing as I have spent the last two and a half years building and scaling an ether wallet.Like most things in this fast-moving space, the tools that are most useful and most needed today are not necessarily the tools that are most useful and needed tomorrow.Let\u2019s start by talking about what exactly a wallet is\u2026which is actually a bit more complicated than you may think.The term wallet is confusing, and people bring a lot of assumptions about this word depending on their experiences inside and outside the crypto-space.Most people start on Coinbase and see Coinbase as a wallet. When those people moved off Coinbase in order to buy tokens or participate in ICOs, we had a terrifically hard time breaking all of their preconceived notions. We spent a lot of time re-training people\u2019s brains to help them comprehend that we don\u2019t hold their funds and we cannot recover their private keys and passwords.When we integrated with Ledger & TREZOR\u2019s Hardware Wallets and Metamask it only became more confusing for new users entering the space.In Andreas Antonopoulos & Gavin Wood\u2019s new book, Mastering Ethereum, they capture what a wallet is and the confusion it creates beautifully:\u201cAt a high level, a wallet is an application that serves as the primary user interface\u2026\u201d\u201cA common misconception about Ethereum is that Ethereum wallets contain ether or tokens. [They are actually stored on the blockchain.] So an Ethereum wallet is actually a keychain.\u201dI strongly prefer the word keychain as it is more representative of what is happening, and it perhaps has less preconceived notions that we would have to break.So, while Antonopoulos & Wood describe it as a user interface (which is how we describe it as well), the reality is new users entering this space do not inherently get this.If we are trying on making the blockchain usable for the masses, we simply can\u2019t have such confusion up front.So, why are wallets such an integral part of the ecosystem today?Right now everything is still speculative. The reason you likely interact with the blockchain today is almost certainly speculative and, even if you aren\u2019t a trader, you are still primarily interacting with only the \u201cmoney\u201d aspect of the blockchain.You are holding funds. You are sending funds. You\u2019re sending them to and from an exchange. And so forth.Until CryptoKitties, Ethereum was almost exclusively used to facilitate ICOs \u2014 which is speculating on the viability of tokens.But, if we think about the future, what is the primary use-case for Ethereum? What should it be used for?This is one of the first infographics I saw in the very early days of Ethereum and it struck a cord with me. It uses WhatsApp and a decentralized version of WhatsApp to explain the potential of Ethereum. These are the types of things that got me excited before Ethereum launched. It\u2019s the world that the blockchain enables. It\u2019s decentralized WhatsApp. Decentralized Twitter. Decentralized Uber.So how do we ensure that these dapps are easily usable?It\u2019s easy to ask ourselves \u201cwhat role does the wallet play in the decentralized future,\u201d but we should really ask \u201cwhat role does the wallet play in centralized apps?\u201d Because if we\u2019re going to have any chance at replacing the current apps and centralized services, it must be easy for the end user.So, what role does the wallet play in a traditional app? Almost none. The payment portions of the app are usually small, tucked away under settings. You spend the least amount of time on any page that has to do with payment.This is because when I go on Airbnb or Uber, I\u2019m not opening that app with the goal of paying someone for their place or for a ride. My goal is to have a place to stay for my next conference or to get a ride from the bar to my house, and it\u2019s easy forget that when we\u2019re thinking about decentralized apps in this space. So much of the conversation is around money - around these new coins and tokens. The payment/money side of things, especially with the utility tokens, should be the smallest part of it.Furthermore, when you visit Airbnb or Uber, do you place the order and then go and visit your mobile banking app to make the payment? Hell no.Pretend that somehow magically a decentralized Airbnb on the blockchain was working today, and you see how absurd the experience would be.Imagine this scenario:I want to book a place for a conference I\u2019m attending. I open up my decentralized Airbnb app. I find the place, read the reviews, and decide \u2014 yes! This is the place for me.The dapp then tells me to get this specfic tokens, open my wallet interface, and send my tokens to the specified address\u2026. with the specified data\u2026 and the specified gas.I then have buy some tokens in order to pay.And, oops, I forgot I must have ETH in my wallet to cover the cost of gas.And, oops, I fucked up and forgot to include the data parameter with my transaction.If I made a single mistake at any one of these points, I risk losing my money and ultimately, I wouldn\u2019t have a place to stay for the conference.If we have any chance at a usable decentralized future, the experience needs to be like Airbnb. I explore places. I find a place. I click a button. I am booked. That\u2019s it.The interaction must be infinitely more frictionless than that. It must be invisible. It must remove as many obstacles in the user\u2019s path as possible.So how do we do that? If we admit that a separate wallet interface is not the ideal way for users to interact with the blockchain, then what is the ideal solution?We cannot expect every dapp to build a wallet interface / keychain into their dapp. This is a waste of time, energy, and opens up a variety of security issues.We need an access layer that is universal and works seamlessly, with as little overhead on the end user as possible.MetaMask, an amaaaazing project with a kickass team, has created browser extensions to handle key management and facilitate interaction with dapps.Mist & Brave have gone the route of creating an entirely new browser.The winning solution in the long term will likely be something even more invisible and more seamless. I think this is because the future doesn\u2019t necessarily exist in your browser or on your computer.We have websites and phones and computers and Xbox\u2019s and our doorbells and our cars and even the lock on our front door. And all of these things will probably want to interact with the blockchain at some point and facilitate transactions. Everything needs to be able to utilize this access layer to seamlessly enable payments via the blockchain in a safe and secure way.What exactly does this look like?I\u2019m going to be honest: I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve been thinking about this a lot and there are a lot of possibilities and pros and cons and things that will change in the coming months and years that influence the technical decisions.However, I do know that if it wins at being invisible, it won\u2019t look like much at all. \ud83d\ude09This access layer will be transparent and integratable and hide all the confusing concepts like gas and private keys and transactions from the user.Because at the end of the day, the user doesn\u2019t want to send tokens. The user wants to rent a place for that conference they are attending.I will back up for a moment because some of you are arguing with me in your heads right now and saying, \u201cthere will never not be wallets, you moron.\u201d Yes. Okay. You win.There will always be speculators and hodlers and traders and situations where you may need to only manage your funds. Therefore, there will probably always be an interface where you can go and just see how much money you have. It just won\u2019t be the primary way the average user interacts with the blockchain, just like you probably don\u2019t spend much time on your mobile banking app.A dedicated wallet interface is not going to be such an integral part of day-to-day life tomorrow. The wallet is just going to be one itty-bitty piece of the ecosystem that serves the investors or traders or hodlers or whatever. It won\u2019t serve the people who want to rent a place or get a ride.So, what are we working on at MyCrypto to help usher in the decentralized future? How do we transition from being a wallet interface to being something that removes friction during the dapp experience? Great question.Previously, I wasn\u2019t focused on the long-term. In fact, that\u2019s the reason why MEW succeeded so quickly \u2014 we were building shit that people needed today. But, it was purely reactionary.As I think about what MyCrypto is going to focus on, I keep returning to this word \u201cbalance.\u201d We want to balance security and ease-of use. We want to balance usability and trustlessness.And we also want to balance solving the problems users have today with the problems the ecosystem is going to have tomorrow.In the short term for MyCrypto we have a fully-audited react & typescript codebase that is going to be entering public beta in the coming weeks. This new codebase enables faster, safer development.We have new infrastructure that reduces our overhead and costs and also sets us up to provide integral features that people really need, like a gas price oracle so the end user doesn\u2019t have to think about it.On the next version of MyCrypto that will be entering public beta in the next few weeks, the user no longer needs to think about gas at all. We will automatically set their gas price based on network conditions. (Of course the option remains for users to customize their settings, it\u2019s just behind an \u201cAdvanced\u201d button.)These are the little items that need to be built on the backend as much as the frontend that will help us move from \u201cwallet interface\u201d to \u201cinvisible access layer\u201dWe have new developer tools that automate builds because as we were building the new codebase, we realized that there were a lot of things missing that we really needed in order to do our jobs more securely and efficiently.We have tools to verify every build of every website and app is verified by multiple parties before it goes live. This ensures everything we do and everything we publish is secure and cannot be compromised by a single party. More simply: myself nor my single computer no longer has the ability to push something live to our hundreds of thousands of users.We have a client-side node balancer to help ensure uptime and further increase decentralization.And we have some awesome typesafe libraries that have make our work with contracts much easier \u2014 and safer.We have been working with the Swarm City team to build out a gas station. This is one of my favorite things in the world.How many of you have gotten in on an ICO or bought a token or something and then when you went to send it, you couldn\u2019t send it because you didn\u2019t have enough ETH in your account for gas?This gas station will enable you to send tokens, even if you don\u2019t have ETH in your account. The transaction fee essentially will be paid in the token, rather than the ETH, via a decentralized API / smart contract.Oh yeah\u2026.and we\u2018re working on new desktop and mobile apps.Once we have more awesome tools that are cross-platform, we can start abstracting away as much as possible. This means the user doesn\u2019t have to understand gas limit or gas price. They also don\u2019t need to have ETH in their account in order to send tokens. They also don\u2019t need to switch nodes if one is offline or responding slowly. It will all be automatic.As much as we like to talk about tech & code & fancy features and tooling, the future really revolves around people. The people are what matter.If you have a product you are building or thinking about building and it\u2019s just in your head, or in a private repo somewhere then you aren\u2019t necessarily building for people. That isn\u2019t going to make the world a better place, or even a different place, and you aren\u2019t going to learn as much as you would if you shared it and collaborated and talked about it with people.Also, it takes all types of people \u2014 not just developers \u2014 to build the decentralized future. This movement is global.We need people of all genders, upbringings, races, sexual orientations, everything. We need people with different experiences. We need different perspectives to solve problems more creatively.Everyone brings something unique to the table and ensures a more powerful decentralized future. This future is not just for technical geniuses.So my question for you today is:What are you doing to help usher in this decentralized future?What unique skills or experiences do you have that you can contribute to this ecosystem?The best part about the blockchain is that everyone can contribute. It\u2019s so new and moving so fast that anyone can create the next Facebook or Google today.I hear \u201cI\u2019m not a developer\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m not a blockchain expert\u201d so often. Fuck that. No one started as a blockchain expert. I was not a blockchain expert. I\u2019m still not an expert. I just soak in as much knowledge as possible. No one went to school for this! All it takes to be part of this world is to want to be part of this world.Stop telling the people around you, stop telling yourself, and stop telling me all the things you can\u2019t or don\u2019t do and shift your thinking. What can you do? What are your experiences? What makes you unique?If you are excited by the journey we are on, find me, find my team, find another team.

Experts expect the value of ether to rise sharply over the next 10 years. In particular, the underlying technology, Ethereum, is likely to be the driving force. In the real world, it is increasingly being used.In April, for example, the business consultants Ernst & Young published a beta version of their new tool for testing Smart Contracts that run via Ethereum. In the same month, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale also issued a covered bond worth USD 162 million based on the blockchain Ethereum.\u201cThe acceptance of Ethereum is steadily increasing, which has a direct impact on the demand for ETH Zurich. All major cloud vendors, including Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, offer Ethereum as a service,\u201d said DARMA.Just A Test Balloon?Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale sold the bond to itself, external buyers were not involved in the deal. The financial institution, therefore, used the issue of a security token as a pilot project, possibly to sound out interest in the market or test its implementation.\u201cThis operation is the first pilot project developed by Societe Generale and Societe Generale FORGE, one of the 60 internal start-ups launched through the Internal Startup Call, the Group\u2019s intrapreneurial program,\u201d commented the bank. Among other things, the aim is to find a more efficient way of issuing bonds and reducing costs. At the same time, the test aims to improve product scalability, shorten time to market and speed securities settlement.SocGen No Stranger To The Crypto BusinessThis is not the first time that the French bank has become active in the field of cryptocurrencies and block chains. In 2017, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale was part of the founding team of the trade finance platform we.trade. One year later, the finance house then joined Komgo SA, a blockchain-based platform for commodity trading.The future for Ethereum looks promising (Photo by Tomasz Frankowski on Unsplash)Is Ether On The Verge Of A Bull Run?Therefore, the investment company is now looking for institutional investors who are also convinced that Ether is ready for a ten-year bull run, Bloomberg reported.\u201cWe will be working with Ether for 10 years,\u201d said Andrew Keys, who recently joined DARMA Capital as Managing Partner.In recent years, the company\u2019s strategy has been to acquire as much ether as possible. In early 2018, it then sold the coins close to their highs, Keys reported. Subsequently, as prices fell again, larger volumes were acquired again. The management of price fluctuations is a focus of the fund, said the co-founder of ConsenSys, a company that develops apps based on Ethereum.Keys now wants to close an existing gap in the market and offer institutional investors, in particular, a solution.\u201cWe want to attract clients to a new asset class,\u201d he said.\u201cMy core competency lies in finance and my secondary competence in technology. There is a gap in the market, and that is a simple solution, and I think a necessary missing piece in the market,\u201d NewsBTC quoted the new Managing Partner.In an interview with Bloomberg, Keys also compared today\u2019s crypto industry to the Internet of the 1990s. Ether is the equivalent of the early Internet. In addition to the Ether funds, similar CFTC-registered funds for Bitcoin & Co. are to be established in the future, as DARMA Capital plans.Altcoin Magazine (@Alt__Magazine) | TwitterThe latest Tweets from Altcoin Magazine (@Alt__Magazine).

There are many other exchanges available such as Kraken or Bitstamp.Notes:1. Coinbase is currently supported in the countries shown on this link.2. Bitstamp has a slightly bigger country offering. See their full list here.3. African users, I spoke with Alex, the founder of Bitcoin Africa about the best exchanges in Africa. He wrote this blog post which with his recommendations.If you already have your Ether wallet with Coinbase you can skip straight to step 5.Step 1 \u2014 Sign up to CoinbaseRegistering with Coinbase is easy. Just follow the onscreen instructions. As part of the KYC (Know Your Customer ) procedure you will be asked for lots of information to confirm your identity including a form of ID (passport, driving license or ID card).Also you will have to confirm your telephone number to allow for two-factor authentication (therefore adding to the security of your account).Step 2 \u2014 Get your Coinbase Wallet AddressSelect \u2018Accounts\u2019 at the top of the page, choose ETH Wallet (which should be set up by default), and then select Receive.This will allow you to copy your private wallet address. Keep this safe and don\u2019t share it publicly.Step 3 \u2014 Send your funds to your Coinbase walletLogin to your current Ether wallet and somewhere there\u2019ll be an option for \u2018Send and Receive\u2019 or something similar. I used My Ether Wallet and on their site it\u2019s called \u2018Send Ether & Tokens\u2019.Most of the process looks similar to your typical online banking. It asks for a \u2018To Address\u2019 (which in this case is the private address I just copied from Coinbase) and also it asks you to input the amount you\u2019d like to send.But then you\u2019ll notice something a little unexpected. What on earth is a Gas Limit?Consider this as the fee for processing your transaction. To go into detail about exactly how it works would take a whole new blog post, so for now we recommend just keeping it at the default 21000.Then click \u2018Generate transaction.\u2019Step 4\u2014 Wait (put the kettle on or something!)With the Ethereum network, transactions are not immediate. You should expect to wait approximately 30 mins or so for your transaction to show in your Coinbase wallet.First it will show as \u2018pending\u2019 before successfully transferring to your wallet.Step 5\u2014 Send your Ether to a Euro walletOnce you\u2019ve received the Ether into your Coinbase ETH wallet, it\u2019s time send it to your Euro wallet on Coinbase. This will automatically be set up in your country\u2019s currency if it is one of those supported by Coinbase.***If you need to change your country you can do this in settings. Make sure you do this BEFORE transferring to your Ether to traditional wallet.***Transferring Ether to your Euro wallet is easy. Select sell, choose the relevant wallets, choose the amount to sell, and then click the button to sell.Coinbase charges a fee of 1.49% per transaction (or 1 euro if your transaction is small) so you can maximise your earnings by selling bigger quantities on a less frequent basis.Note: Some people have the option to sell directly to their bank account. For me, this option hasn\u2019t been enabled yet so I had to sell to a Coinbase Euro wallet before sending it to my bank account.Step 6 \u2014 Verify your bank accountFinally, the end is in sight, you\u2019ve nearly got your hands on the Ether you\u2019ve earned. There\u2019s just one more obstacle you\u2019ve got to contend with\u2026The first time you send money from your Coinbase wallet to your bank account, you also need to verify your bank account by sending a small amount of money to Coinbase. They don\u2019t specify a minimum amount but your online banking provider may.I transferred 2 euros which then gets added to your Coinbase balance once the transaction has been processed.Unfortunately, this verification isn\u2019t instant either and in fact will usually take 1\u20132 working days.Step 7 \u2014 Make the transactionOnce your bank account is verified you can finally make that transaction! For that, simply click on accounts at the top of the page, scroll down to your Euro wallet (or whatever your local currency is) and then select \u2018Withdraw\u2019.Step 8 \u2014 Spend you glorious earnings2\u20133 days after choosing to withdraw your money finally hits your bank account! You can now finally buy that pizza you wanted to buy almost a week ago!Okay, so currently the process has many more steps and takes longer than traditional banking, but blockchain technology is still in its infancy. There are hundreds of companies that are experimenting with new ways to use it and integrate it into our everyday life.And you, as a Microwork App user, are an early adopter in this new technology. So whether you decide to keep your earnings in Ether or switch them to your local currency, we hope you enjoy playing such an important role in this new technology.Finally, time for pizza!Still wondering what the hell cryptocurrency even is?

ICOs were the first killer application of Ethereum. The huge demand for Ether, by investors who wanted to participate in ICOs, drove up Ether\u2019s price exponentially. But where will the next huge demand for Ether come from? What will be the next killer application of Ethereum? In my opinion, stablecoins will be the next killer application pushing for an explosion in Ether price. Let\u2019s see why.Three Types: One Viable OptionThere are three types of stablecoins today: Fiat-collateralized, crypto-collateralized, and non-collateralized. The only ones proven to be reliable and fully decentralized are crypto-collateralized stablecoins. Fiat-collateralized stablecoins aren\u2019t decentralized at all, allowing governments to easily destroy them by blocking their bank accounts. Non-collateralized stablecoins, on the other hand, aren\u2019t reliable because of their design. Their creation creates a non-negligible economic problem beyond the scope of this text. As a result, crypto-collateralized stablecoins make the only viable decentralized approach to creating stability in the blockchain world. In the discussion to follow, whenever I use stablecoins, I mean crypto-collaterized stablecoins.New Demand for Ether as Collateral of LoansIn contrast to the first-generation of cryptocurrencies which are only created, stablecoins are created as demand increases and destroyed as it decreases. But how can they destroy the previously created coins? Stablecoins are created as debt by paying new loans whenever their price increases. Being created as debt, they are enabled to destroy the previously created coins by settling the previous loans whenever their price falls. That is why they can always match their supply with their demand and be stable.What turns out from the term \u201ccrypto-collateralized\u201d is that loans paid here by smart contracts are collateralized by cryptocurrencies. For example, when you want to take a Dai loan from MakerDAO, you freeze some Ether in MakerDAO as a guarantee that you will repay your loan. As the US mortgage market collapse of the 2000s has shown, Collateral is an unstable asset whose price may decrease significantly. Stablecoin smart contracts are designed to take, for example, two or three times more collateral than the original value of the loan as a strong measure against this instability. This seeks to keep the value of collateral is always higher than the debt it\u2019s borrowed against so a borrower is able to pay back their loan.Let\u2019s put it another way, two or three times more collateral on crypto-based stablecoins would generate demand for two or three times more Ethereum purchased and locked away. For example for each 1 Dai which is worth $1, there is an equivalent of $2 or $3 value of Ether freezed in MakerDAO to back that Dai. In other words, any $1 billion growth in stablecoins\u2019 market brings a $2 billion new demand to the market of a cryptocurrency which is used to back it.The following questions arises here: How big can the stablecoin market become? Can the stablecoins market size become so large their demand for Ether as collateral puts pressure on Ether market?A Huge Market for \u201cMinimizing the Risks\u201d Instead of \u201cMaximizing the Profits\u201dIf we consider today cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, the gold of blockchain world, stablecoins are the money of this new territory. It may be interesting to know that money market size in today economy is more than 10 times larger than the $7.7 trillion gold market and amounts to $90 trillion!There is a common misbelief among crypto community that gold is a better \u201cstore of value\u201d than fiat money. But if gold is better, why is the money market 10 times larger? There is an important difference between \u201cstoring value\u201d in gold and in money which is generally ignored by crypto community.Although both gold and money market customers are looking for \u201cstoring value\u201d, gold market customers are seeking to \u201cmaximize the profits\u201d in storing value, while customers of money market want to \u201cminimize the risks\u201d. In other words, customers of gold market are those who are seeking to invest and grow their asset value, thereby accepting the risk of lowering this value as a result of gold price decrease. But money market customers are the ones who are not willing to accept any risk and are just seeking the maintenance of their asset value, not its growth.Today cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, were interesting options for gold market customers, not for money market ones. But stablecoins can pave the way of entering a huge number of money market customers, who don\u2019t like risks, into the decentralized and free blockchain world. If we take a look at today growing conflicts between big economic powers, which are strongly threatening the global free trade, we can easily find out why stablecoins can be very attractive to worldwide merchants to allow them to bypass the increasing limits on their international trades.Today cryptocurrencies were able to attract 5% of gold market customers to reach today\u2019s $400 billion market size. If stablecoins happen to reach 1% of today\u2019s money market size someday, they would have a $800 billion market. The most interesting part of such an event for Ether HODLers would be that, in such a day, Ether market should be at least two times bigger and worth $1.6 trillion in order to back such amount of stablecoins!Why Ethereum?You may want to know why I emphasize on Ethereum and think that Ether, and not any other cryptocurrencies\u2019, HODLers will win most of the benefits of stablecoins\u2019 emergence in blockchain world. There are two reasons. The first one can be easily found out by taking a look at tens of stablecoins\u2019 solutions currently rising in blockchain world. Almost all of them are implementing their system on top of Ethereum network. Why? Because it\u2019s the most simple approach. That\u2019s exactly the reason Ethereum built for, i.e being a platform for the big community of developers to implement anything they like on top of it as simply as possible, without facing many complexities in underlying and low level parts of blockchain.But there is still a more important economic reason why I think Ethereum is the best platform to host stablecoins. One of the most important risks threatening the stability of a stablecoin is that its backing cryptocurrency drops in value in a way that its collateral value becomes less than the loan value itself. It\u2019s just like what happened to many banks in 2008 economic crisis where the price of houses used as collateral for too many loans in US went below the loan value itself.The price of cryptocurrencies with low market size can be easily manipulated by speculators through pumping and dumping strategies. The bigger the market of an asset used as collateral is, the less the risk of a sharp drop in its price is. Although Bitcoin has the biggest market in blockchain world, it\u2019s not a proper platform to develop stablecoins on, since it can\u2019t host complicated stablecoins\u2019 smart contracts; however, Ethereum, with the second biggest market, is the best platform to develop stablecoins on with the least risk of being attacked by speculators.Stablecoins Are like Emails, Social Networks Need Time to Be Born!Blockchain community doesn\u2019t like stablecoins and thinks that the future of money will be completely different from today\u2019s stable fiat model. They\u2019re right! But we always traverse the path to the future gradually and step by step. When the Internet emerged to change the way we communicate, we were not able to imagine today\u2019s social networks, like instagram, facebook, twitter, etc. We just replaced mails, i.e the old means of communication, with emails, i.e the electronic version of that!As the Internet was a platform for free communication, Blockchain is a platform for free \u201ceconomic\u201d communication. Stablecoins, for blockchain world, are just like emails for the Internet. They just add freedom from governments to fiats, and for sure it\u2019s not a small upgrade.Stablecoins can be the first step to bring the mass used to the old traditional economic communication, i.e. using fiat as money, to Ethereum as our new discovered freedomland. Stablecoins can be the first step of blockchain to pass from competing gold bugs and start competing governments in the money market which is 10x bigger than the gold one.Special thanks to Leslie Ankney for helping me with this episode.This is the 3rd hackernoon story from the \u201cFreedomland: Ethereum from monetary viewpoint\u201d series.

Nevertheless, one barrier that stops people from doing so is unfamiliarity with the token sale process. At a glance, funding your favorite project through a token sale might seem complicated. However, once you get there, it will be a piece of cake. This article will show you how to create an ERC20 Ether wallet, a step required to participate in most token sales issued on the Ethereum blockchain, including the Taylor token saleWhy do you need an ERC20 compatible Ethereum wallet?Most token sales are built on the Ethereum blockchain; therefore, you need to have an Ether wallet compatible with ERC20 protocol in order to participate. To ensure full control over your assets, you must use a wallet for which you have control of the private key. It is not recommended to use a third-party portfolio such as your wallet in an exchange or from a company that has custody of the resources. Having control of your own portfolio is key to appropriately controlling and moving your resources.DO NOT SEND COINS FROM ANY CRYPTOCURRENCY EXCHANGES FOR BITNAUTIC SALE TRANSACTIONS. YOU MUST USE AN ERC20 COMPATIBLE ETHEREUM WALLET. OTHERWISE, YOU WILL LOSE YOUR FUNDS.To clear the confusion, here is a list of Ethereum wallets that are compatible with our token sale requirements.Compatible walletsThese wallets have been verified to support Ethereum ERC20 tokens. The list is continuously updated at: TokenMarketMyEtherWallet (Online and local browser)MetaMask (Firefox and Chrome browser extension)Parity (Desktop)Jaxx (iPhone and Android)Incompatible walletsTo date, these Ethereum wallets are known to be incompatible with token sales.

One reason is a more active Ethereum Futures product.U.S. bank JP Morgan Chase revealed it had created an enterprise version of the Ethereum blockchain. J.P Morgan Chase is of late behaving like a technology company and endorsing Ethereum.The Quorum ecosystem is an enterprise version of Ethereum that has been designed to run any application that requires high computational speeds as well as large throughput processing power. It\u2019s also getting increased backing, including from J.P. Morgan Chase. It amounts to Umar Farooq, Head of JPs Blockchain Initiatives, being apparently bullish on Quorums\u2019 use of tokenizing gold bars in the custody of various financial institutions.

Photo by Steve Jennings/Getty Images for TechCrunch.Velocity could make Ethereum a bad investment, but still a great technologyTrent EadyFollowMay 14, 2018 \u00b7 5 min readI recently sold 70% of my Ether (the built-in cryptocurrency of the Ethereum platform) after I came to doubt its promise as an investment\u2014 although my optimism about its potential as a technology remains as high as ever. This might sound paradoxical, but it isn\u2019t.The key realization I had is that there is a good chance Ether won\u2019t behave like shares in a company, but will instead behave like the currency of a country. If you want to invest in the U.S. economy, you should buy stocks in U.S. companies, not hold U.S. dollars. Holding a fiat currency is a bad investment because it\u2019s inflationary. It decreases in value over time. I\u2019ve begun to suspect the same might be true of some cryptocurrencies, like Ether. If you want to invest in the Ethereum economy, holding Ether might not be a viable way to do that.Unlike Bitcoin for instance, the supply of U.S. dollars increases indefinitely year after year, with no hard limit. With a fixed supply of Ether, some investors assume Ether will be deflationary. It will retain value, and even appreciate in value. Fixed supply is by no means a foregone conclusion for Ether; it\u2019s a topic of active debate. But even with fixed supply, Ether might still depreciate in value.Even with a static money supply, an increase in velocity will cause a decrease in the value of a unit of currency. Velocity is the average number of times that 1 Ether or 1 U.S. dollar changes hands in a given year. Velocity is the \u201cV\u201d in the equation of exchange: MV = PQ. The equation of exchange is the method that Chris Burniske and Jack Tatar use to value cryptocurrencies in their book Cryptoassets. Since I haven\u2019t heard of a rigorous alternative (and I\u2019ve looked), this is the valuation method I\u2019m using.Suppose the Ethereum platform facilitates $12 trillion in transactions per year \u2014 equivalent to the GDP of China. Suppose also that the velocity of Ether is 40x the velocity of the U.S. dollar, which is currently around 5. $12 trillion divided by a velocity of 200 is $60 billion, so that would put the network value of Ether below its current (at the time of writing) network value of around $70 billion.Here\u2019s another scenario. Suppose Ethereum does $1 trillion in transactions per year, and the velocity is 15 \u2014 only 3x the velocity of the U.S. dollar. That would put the network value at $67 billion. Again, below the current network value.I do not believe this guaranteed to happen. I just believe that it is enough of a possibility that I no longer consider Ether to be a wise investment. The opposite is also possible: Ether might have a lower velocity than the U.S. dollar, perhaps because of widespread use as a store of value (like gold). At half the U.S. dollar\u2019s velocity, $12 trillion in annual transactions would yield a market value of $4.8 trillion. $1 trillion in transactions would yield $400 billion.Here\u2019s why I think Ether\u2019s velocity might end up being much higher than the U.S. dollar\u2019s velocity. Imagine a world in which the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s development roadmap has been successfully executed, and transactions are so fast and scalable it\u2019s now possible to play StarCraft on the Ethereum blockchain. Imagine the Ethereum dapp ecosystem begins to explode like the iOS app ecosystem did after the launch of the App Store. What level of velocity might we see then?If a large portion of the Internet begins to run on Ethereum blockchain transactions, then I have to think that the typical Internet user will be involved in many more Ether transactions per day than fiat currency transactions. It isn\u2019t rare that I go an entire day without executing a single fiat currency transaction. By contrast, I use multiple apps every day.If some of those apps become Ethereum dapps, and every time I use an Ethereum dapp I execute multiple Ether transactions, then I have to imagine the velocity of Ether will be staggering. Every day, I\u2019ll be executing hundreds, maybe thousands, of Ether transactions, compared to a handful of fiat transactions on a busy day.This is why it doesn\u2019t strike me as crazy that the velocity of Ether could be 40x that of the U.S. dollar. I can see the daily number of Ether transactions for a typical Internet user being 40x higher than the number of fiat currency transactions they execute in a day.One last scenario. Let\u2019s suppose the Ethereum economy grows to the size of the entire world economy: $80 trillion. What velocity would Ether need in order to have a network value of only $50 billion (~70% of its value today)? It would need a velocity of 1600, which is 320x the U.S. dollar\u2019s current velocity. I\u2019d say that $80 trillion in annual transactions is probably close to the very best case scenario for Ethereum. So if you want to invest in Ethereum, you better be confident that velocity will be less than 1600.If a single game of blockchain StarCraft involves a few hundred or thousand transactions, then the investment case for Ether would seem to entirely fall apart. Doubly so for social media dapps.That future where we\u2019re playing video games and using social networks on the blockchain is one I want to live in. It sounds exciting, cool, liberating, and attainable. I haven\u2019t changed my mind about the potential of blockchain technology. Just the potential of Ether as an investment vehicle. Remember, we were never promised that Ether would be a good investment. The purpose of Ethereum is not to enrich investors. It\u2019s to build a new era of the Internet, to make money digital, and enable decentralized institutions.If you want to get rich off cryptocurrency, sorry, that might not happen. But if you want to live in a future where blockchains improve human life, I think your chances are a lot better.Edit (December 8, 2018): Jose Maria Macedo has a response to this argument about velocity that I recommend reading.Disclosure: I own Ether.Disclaimer: This is not investment advice.", "responses": 24, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Cryptocurrency", "Ethereum", "Technology", "Cryptocurrency Investment"]}, {"title": "Speccing Colors in Design Systems", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@ethersystem/speccing-colors-in-design-systems-f06e91ed9ca0?source=search_post", "author_name": "Ether", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@ethersystem", "publish_date": "2017-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-19", "readtime": "7.11", "claps": 986, "voters": 197, "content": "Speccing Colors in Design SystemsEvery design system involves a comprehensive collection of colors, but what\u2019s the best way to generate them? And how many should you have?EtherFollowNov 16, 2017 \u00b7 8 min readPart 1: Defining ColorsWhich Colors to IncludeWhen creating a comprehensive color system you want to make sure that you address color across three main uses:UI Colors \u2014 UI colors apply to the core aspects of your interface: buttons, text, and inputs. You want to make sure that you have access to the appropriate action colors, hover colors, and other interface colors needed to build your components and guide users to your products goals.Semantic Colors \u2014 Sometimes colors have to mean something. You\u2019ll want to make sure you include colors that can be used for success, warning, danger, and other instances where using a specific color matters more than being unique or on-brand.Layout Colors \u2014 These are the core of your palette and used for page layout: containers, borders, cards, rules, headers, footers, and sidebars. For most products it\u2019s a beautiful palette of 37 shades of slate grey.Honorable Mention goes to Data Visualization Colors if your app requires a lot of charts and graphs, and Brand Colors if you need to encompass those into your system alongside the rest of the palettes.These color concepts can all overlap in tones (and we would suggest they do to keep the system manageable). You should be able to address each of these aspects of your product in a meaningful way with the colors defined in your system. In Scenery-produced systems, we define at least 8\u201312 core colors to do each of those jobs well.Once you know what colors your system needs, you can move on to a far messier topic: shades and tints \u2014 shivers.Color VariationsMost brand guidelines get the benefit of defining just core colors. \u201cThis is our red. This is our blue.\u201d Sadly, your system doesn\u2019t get that luxury. UI design requires multiple shades and tints of colors to effectively apply color. But how many shades and tints do you need?Answer: as few as necessary.Material Design specs a whopping 14 shades of each core color. At first glance, this massive tonal range seems to provide a bounty of options, but instead it creates a paradox of choice. At worst, it\u2019s asking for wildly inconsistent use of color across the system. At best, it just adds unnecessary design and documentation cruft.In our largest systems project here at the Scenery we started by speccing a set of 10 layout colors including white. Almost two years later, we did a color audit and learned something interesting: we never used four of the tones. We had 5 designers separately spinning up components for an enterprise system being used by over 3 dozen internal and external engineers over years, and still never used over 33% of our color variables. Let that sink in.The reason was actually simple once we thought about it for a bit. It was all about contrast.Unused tones are marked with a dreaded X.You won\u2019t (and shouldn\u2019t) use tones you can\u2019t effectively pair with other variables to create useful contrast. The color tones that acheive that goal will be on the ends of your tonal spectrum, making any more than one middle tone unnecessary. This not only makes your spectrums smaller, it also removes tones that ruin your system\u2019s accessibility. We call that a win-win.At The Scenery, we\u2019ve refined most of our own systems down to a core color, 3\u20134 lighter tints and 2 shades. The shades help for things like hover interactions and borders, and the tints come in handy as background colors and inverse colors.So now that we know what colors and how many we need, how do we go about pairing them with actual hex values?Part 2: Generating ColorsThere are plenty of ways to generate colors for your design system, but are they all created equal? Let\u2019s explore the pros and cons of the typically-used methods.Sass/CSS GeneratedOne the easiest ways to generate colors for a system is to use code. We\u2019ve been playing with this idea for a while, and it has solid value, especially when it comes to reducing the design overhead of color palette derivation.Examples of these types of generators can be found more and more, one of our favorites is Palx.ProsSpeed \u2014 This is by far the easiest system from an input standpoint, requiring the least up-front work to generate the most variables.Flexibility \u2014 Palettes generated by the tools we\u2019ve used and built are able to create a myriad of tones for use across applications. Along with this scale, colors can be easily swapped in and out with minimal design or dev overhead. So your semantic green changed? Edit one variable\u2014done!Consistency \u2014 Code is above all things consistent. Having a system that provides a consistent framework for color variables and their definition can be very valuable to larger teams where process means more than bespoke customization.ConsLack of Control \u2014 Code can generate some weird colors. If you\u2019ve ever tried to lighten certain shades of green using Sass you know very well what I\u2019m talking about. Along with that, certain colors can shift tones dramatically as they get lighter.Color Bias \u2014 Color generators are always biased towards the tones that they were built to work with. Say you build a generator that takes a color and generates 5 tints by lightening them using Sass. If the input color is a darker tone you could very well end up with 5 usable color tints based on the original. If the input color changes to a light purple, you could end up with only one usable tint out of the 5. Or none at all.Hand-PickedFor some systems you need to spec your colors the good-old-fashioned way: with hand-picked hex values. Although time-consuming and design-heavy, the level of accuracy this method provides can be worth it if your designers have that level of availability.ProsControl \u2014Designers are picky people. We know it. No computer is going to tell us what that color-variable should be as well as we could.Quality \u2014 Palettes generated by hand can purposefully color shift as tones get darker or lighter and have more nuanced tonal variations than those generated using hard code. This means your palette has more useful tones and more colors to choose from.ConsTime \u2014 For most teams there\u2019s not enough of it in the day. And even less when a designer has to custom spec a hundred individual shades of a core color palette.Change \u2014 Hand-specced colors and variables not only take up-front time, but they require that same investment every time a color is added or changed. That overhead can add up for systems that are still in flux or just getting started.While grabbing hex values across a color\u2019s tones by hand it can be valuable to keep in mind two tricks:Make sure to use a curved path through tonal ranges. A straight line rarely maintains a quality color saturation throughout a color\u2019s variations.Watch for and correct color shifts as tones get lighter. Many seemingly neutral greys can shift into other colors (purple, anyone?) when getting lighter.Moving through tones on a curve can keep saturation intact and eliminate muddy tones.Our current color lockups show tints, shades, and hex values.Hybrid\u2014What We Do NowBoth of these methods have their pros and cons when used as a sole means of color generation. You can get more bang for your buck when you use them in tandem to create custom palettes based on generated values. How? We\u2019ll tell you!Pick core system colors.Define stops necessary for tonal variations (the less the better).Generate colors using a tool to maintain consistency and test for accessibility along the way.Edit colors as necessary to compensate for shifts and maintain tone and saturation across a color spectrum.By combining methods, we\u2019re able to generate a core color and six variations in half an hour, and maintain the level of control and quality we think our systems should have.Part 3: Naming ColorsNaming colors is one of the most challenging parts of a color system. Many systems try to map color tones to their relative lightness, but this can be problematic because it creates a very loose mental model. Other systems will try to name colors based on use or heirarchy and those are equally problematic.In our experience we have found that a successful naming system accomplishes two main goals:It is understandable by developers and designers alike. In early systems we tried to name colors that did too many things like $primary and $secondary but quickly realized these names meant nothing. They couldn\u2019t help designers apply them effectively. \u201cIs this button primary, or an accent, or semantic?\u201d These types of names also confused developers trying to find the right color to map to the design flats they received.It creates a simple and reusable mental model for changing stops. This is where more established color systems with lightness-based variable names falter. The best way to test this is to ask the question \u201cWhat variables come before and after this one?\u201d If you have stops with names like $color \u2014 10, $color \u2014 20 then your model makes sense, but you have to have a huge amount of stops to maintain the model. Also, if you throw in half-tones like Material Design\u2019s $color \u2014 05 you create outlying patterns that people using your system have to learn and anticipate.For our own internal system the convention that achieved those goals best was a simple one. We currently use a nomenclature of $color \u2014 dark/light \u2014 stops, ie. $green, green-dark-1, green-light-2. This ensure that the color\u2019s name is representative, while also easily changeable to alternate tones.Regardless of your specific convention, if you can keep those two goals in mind you will be well on your way to creating a color-naming system that works for everyone on your team, no matter their role.ResourcesPalx by Brent JacksonColor Tool by GoogleChroma.js Scale HelperHexNaw by The SceneryFor more, check out the Color & Color Palettes section of Jessica Paoli\u2019s designresources.partyEther is coming soon.

They also do so to combat critique by isolating some of its premises (\u201cBitcoin is expensive to use! \u2014 But it\u2019s not meant to be \u2018used\u2019 that often!\u201d).Proactive and reactive sense-making.Nobody can know everything. The complexity of society is irreducible. We cling to mental models that satisfy our thirst for understanding a given phenomenon, and stick to groups who identify with similar narratives.Image of the DEV plan\u00b3 circulated in 2014, at the time of the Ether sale.Beliefs are not only shaped by reality; they define it. In any social arena, there\u2019s a never ending battle to tells what\u2019s happening, why is it happening, and what is happening next. Controlling narratives is particularly powerful in cryptoland\u00b2 given the innate complexity and polytechnic nature of the field.As 2018 unwinds over filled weeks in Berlin and Prague for the Ethereum community, it seems like a proper moment to reflect.What exactly should Ether be? And how have our views on it changed, in the past 5 years? Below, we chronicle disparate answers to these questions over time.\u23f3 Ether over timeIn the absence of a reachable leader, Bitcoiners rely on founding documents to debate the currency\u2019s ethos (e.g. \u201cdecipher what Satoshi \u2018truly wanted\u2019\u201d).Ethereum.org from 2014 to 2018.Ethereum is way younger than Bitcoin. In the quest for legitimacy, it has flirted with a broad range of overarching narratives\u2074. Founding documents are recent, their authors are still around, discordance abounds even among them\u2075.In Ethereum, vocation is an ever-growing construction (like bees building a hive), much more than an exercise in regression (like Theseus rolling back a ball of thread to escape the labyrinth).Here we break down seven major themes around which Ethereum development has revolved, along time. In rough order of appearance:1. Bitcoin 2.0:Ethereum was unveiled to the public at a Bitcoin conference\u2076. Early media coverage was very reliant on comparisons to the predecessor cryptocurrency (see 2014\u2019s \u201cBitcoin\u2019s most ambitious successor\u201d by Al Jazeera\u2077; \u201cBitcoin 2.0\u201d by Bloomberg\u2078). The original motivation for Ethereum stemmed from Bitcoin\u2019s scripting limitations. The tale of a young idealist leaving the \u201ctoxic\u201d bitcoin underworld was appealing to mainstream journalists having to report on crypto after the 10x price increase in BTC by the end of 2013. Although this narrative lost momentum as Ethereum carved its own identity, it\u2019s still a popular way for newcomers to see $ETH when first picturing the space.2. dApps (a.k.a. World Computer):Technically, from the beginning, Ethereum was meant to be \u201ca platform for the deployment and execution of smart contracts\u201d. Old promotional material already described $ETH as \u201ccrypto-fuel\u201d: the asset is to smart contracts akin to what gasoline is to cars. The vision of a \u201cworld computer\u201d lost gas (\ud83d\ude09) as scaling took longer than expected, dApps didn\u2019t proliferate, and alternative smart contract platforms started to gain traction.Tokens, derivatives, name registries and DAOs were a part of Ethereum\u2019s online presence since the beginning - Ethereum.org, 2014.3. DAOs:The promise of ownerless organisations has always been a magnet for the politically-inclined ones. Proposals like the famed People\u2019s Republic of DOUG\u2079 (the first Ethereum-based DAO\u00b2) were common in Ethereum\u2019s early days. Vinay Gupta, who coordinated releases for the Foundation, used to jam on what he called \u201cState in a Box\u201d\u00b9\u2070. TheDAO\u00b9\u00b9 obviously blew everyone\u2019s expectations, and slowed down excitement for autonomous experiments. This narrative slowly languished as no DAO truly thrived; but it has seen resurgence as ICO-funded organisations did no better; and toolkits for managing ownerless organisations are finally coming to main net.4. Crypto-crowdfunding (ICOs & STOs):Ethereum\u2019s mere existence is a testament to the power of borderless crypto-crowdfunding. Such has been praised the most eminent utility of ETH since it became obvious that deploying a token was the most straightforward thing to do with contracts. The story-line weakened as the SEC\u2019s increased scrutiny towards the industry\u00b9\u00b2 and natural selection exerted its effect on the market\u00b9\u00b3.5. Utility tokens & collectibles:As the \u201cpath to liquidity\u201d for new tokens started to get more complicated, a lot of focus shifted to studying\u00b9\u2074, simulating and improving already existing token frameworks\u00b9\u2075. For some time, \u201cutility\u201d actually meant \u201cdefence to legal enforcement targeting securities\u201d, even more than it meant \u201cmoulding incentives\u201d. The introduction of the \u201cNFT standard\u201d\u00b9\u2076 in 2017 jumpstarted exploration of non-fungible tokens and highlighted the value proposition of games with shared states. These were already spoken of in Ethereum\u2019s early 2014 videos, hinting at what would later become a very hyped use case.6. Open finance:The \u201copen finance\u201d narrative\u00b9\u2077 emerged in response to the frivolous abundance of tokens in the market. Abstracting ownership via socially agreed information structures (titles, tokens) is key to economic development\u00b9\u2078. Hernando de Soto argues that $9.3 trillion in property is economically dead capital (lost value) due to improper rights registration - mostly in the hands of the poorest. The point is: benefits of asset digitisation are somehow plutocratic until people have permissionless, shared economic infrastructure \u2014 what this story is about. 0x\u2019s success in building an ecosystem of relayers from scratch fostered intense experimentation with financial instruments. The #DeFi Alliance was established by leading entities in the field. After the Fat Protocol and the Fat Monies \u201cthesis\u201d, the \u201cFat Wallet\u201d theme\u00b9\u2079 arose, in line with the philosophy of \u201ctruly open source bankware\u201d\u00b2\u2070.7. Radical Markets\u00b2\u00b9:\u201cOpen finance\u201d is great, but instead of emulating the complex financial arrangements we\u2019re used to in the real world, what if we could redesign markets from the ground up? How can programmable money help evolve private property contracts, improve (or liquidate) representative democracy, and prevent data harvesting in order to spawn more inclusive and efficient markets? Where is permissionless infrastructure needed the most? How can the community maximise social impact per unit of effort? From mid-2018 onwards, Ethereum started to be revered by the social values it embodies\u00b2\u00b2 as much as it had been for its technical merits. If bitcoin was well-positioned to capitalise the aftermath of the last big financial crisis, Ether seems poised to fill the void left by the cultural, political and economic decline of surveillance capitalism\u00b2\u00b3 (as depicted by the slow corrosion of Facebook\u2019s empire), in what appears to be a societal shift towards a more liberal future.Much of the analysis here relies on the subjective interpretation of documents, Reddit posts, archived webpages, DevPost submissions and Github discussions. If you disagree, I welcome suggestions for alternatives.\ud83d\udd52 Timeline\u201cWhen [\u2026] bitcoin began, the anonymous wizard desired to test two parameters- a trustless, decentralized database [\u2026] and a robust transaction system capable of sending value across the world without intermediaries. Yet the past five years have painfully demonstrated a third missing feature: a sufficiently powerful Turing-complete scripting language.\u201d \u2014 Vitalik, Official Ethereum.org website, 2013\u201314Vitalik has worked on KrypoKit (a wallet backed by Roger Ver and Erik Voorhees) and Amir Taaki\u2019s Dark Wallet. He co-founded Bitcoin Magazine with Mihai Alisie and wrote for it extensively. After frustrations with Bitcoin\u2019s apathy in welcoming changes, Vitalik devoted some time to Mastercoin. He had some proposals for generalisation rejected there; pondered about implementing his ideas on Primecoin; and finally decided to go for a new blockchain\u00b2\u2074.Founding members in Miami, during the 2014 North American Bitcoin Conference.The Ethereum whitepaper began to be circulated by the end of 2013, and in early 2014 the project was unveiled at the North American Bitcoin Conference while most of the founding members were staying in a house together\u00b2\u2075. Seed capital was secured, leading to a jurisdictional adventure that ended up setting a legal entity in Switzerland\u00b2\u2076.The team had to decide between a \u201ccrypto-Mozilla\u201d (non-profit) or \u201ccrypto-Google\u201d (for profit) approach. The later was reportedly favoured at first, but a non-profit structure ended up being chosen\u00b2\u2077. In light of conflict, Charles Hoskinson, who served briefly as a CEO to the project, departed\u00b2\u2078.The Ether sale went smooth on mid-2014 attracting around 6.000 lucky participants\u00b2\u2079.One year later (and treasury management hell for the freshly established Foundation after a sudden drop in BTC), a competition was held to find bugs while on a test net. During this time, the Olympic period, some contestants earned up to 3500 $ETH in rewards\u00b3\u2070 \u2014 close to U$ 700K in today\u2019s prices.First block on Frontier is mined. Via Lefteris Karapetsas\u2019 twitter.The subsequent Frontier release brought the first version of the main net alive. It\u2019s hard to believe today, but, at that point, some doubted the Ethereum Foundation would even survive the imminent financial collapse.Nevertheless, there were code contributions coming from everywhere, and a sparse community already organising meetups in random corners of the globe. Ethereum had started walking on its own.ICOs begun proliferating that very same year, more pervasively after the ERC20 standard was proposed in 19th of November of 2015\u00b3\u00b9. Months earlier, Augur had notably conducted the first ICO on the network. Their pioneership costed a painful migration to the newly accepted token standard later down the line\u00b3\u00b2.Visualising Ethereum\u2019s PoW and Virtual Machine - by atomh33ls.In early 2016, the second main net release - Homestead - went to production.From that moment onwards, the network wouldn\u2019t live through a full year of peace, until present days - having had to deal with bug exploits, hacks and DoS attacks that repeatedly diverged community attention from important decisions towards more urgent ones.From ICO to mainnet, Ethereum took 1 year.From 1st production release to 2nd, it took 9 months.From 2nd production release to 3rd, it\u2019s taking ~2.5 years, and counting.Soon after the Homestead release, it became clear that Ethereum had outgrown its founders, and evolved to a point where it could cause significant economical impact - for good and for bad.The DAO experiment drew worldwide attention. It was funded (very) successfully in May 2016, attacked in June, and caused a fork to happen in July\u00b9\u00b9. The White Hat group formed amidst the uncertain days that followed the incident. A counter attack that limited the action of the stealer was executed successfully, and gave the community time to think through viable courses of action\u00b3\u00b3.Alexey Akhunov spots something abnormal in TheDAO, kicking off what became a historical Reddit thread.The heated debate that followed dissected property rights, interventionism vs. non-interventionism, and the weight of social consensus\u00b3\u2074. As it became clear, some scars forged during the reaction to the DAO hack would be permanent from then on. A hard fork was conducted in collaboration with key stakeholders in the ecosystem.The split signalled that the notion of absolute immutability was not primordial for Ethereum (the overarching narrative of a \u201cplatform for DAOs\u201d significantly lost momentum). Social consensus was openly acknowledged to be at least as important as \u201cprotocol consensus\u201d. Worth remembering, the asset we refer to as ETH today belongs to the fork of the original chain, whose token is now ETC.Response to the DoS attack at DevCon II, in a \u201cmedia room turned into war room\u201d. Via Alex Van de Sande\u2019s twitter.In the aftermath of the split, towards the end of 2016, the network would still suffer a severe DoS attack while DevCon II was happening in Shanghai\u00b3\u2075. The fast, coordinated response served as a display of maturity for the disperse group of developers strengthened after a troublesome 12-month period.2017 was a year of consolidation. Ethereum had attracted wide community attention after surviving the post-DAO fork. Both ETH and ETC would still rise significantly in value. ETH had conquered liquidity on all major crypto exchanges. Silicon Valley was fond of it, and helped the asset capitalise like no other the wave of mainstream interest that arose through the period.ICOs raised billions of dollars, and expectations on the sector outgrew actual usage. Celebrities from Floyd Mayweather to Paris Hilton to Ronaldinho endorsed ERC20 coins (2 out of these 3 were condemned as scams; 1 is still pending). The carefulness with which Vitalik & co. had incepted Ethereum (from a legal and technical standpoint) was far from what became the standard for tokens throughout 2016\u201317\u00b3\u2076.Timeline of the protocol, by Brave New Coin. The second-to-last milestone is already outdated \u2014 postponed to January 2019.As competing smart contract platforms started to blossom, large ETH holders prompted a lobbying effort aimed at preventing the currency from eventually being deemed a security by the SEC\u00b3\u2077. The agency adopted a more proactive stance on enforcement - progressively targeting bigger enterprises (as of today, dozens of entities have already been involved in \u201cOperation Cryptosweep\u201d). Needless to say, ICOs (and STOs, and whatever came next) lost much of their appeal\u00b3\u2078.Teams who held on to their tokens mostly justified so by differentiating on the game theoretic /economic properties of their systems. \u201cTokenomics\u201d (the term) gained popularity in mid-2017\u00b3\u2079. Crypto-collectibles rose to prominence soon after.By late 2017, Cryptokitties clogged the network and gave Silicon Valley a pet project to cheer for\u2074\u2070. Millions of VC dollars flowed to crypto-games, NFT marketplaces and art-collection related projects. Little measurable demand followed. CryptoKitties stabilised at a couple hundred daily users. A Warhol was auctioned to a collective of shareholders via the Ethereum-based Codex Protocol. As of today, there are still people who blog enthusiastically about accumulating and trading estate on Decentraland.Despite the excitement, the network hadn\u2019t proven to be a safe fund-guarding system nor a fully decentral-governed one. In the turn from 2017 to 2018, the community faced yet another dead-lock.Core contributors right after noticing the exploit on Parity multisig wallets, in mid-2017.Two incidents in July and November of 2017 (a hack\u2074\u00b9 and an accident\u2074\u00b2, presumably, involving Parity software) led to rightful owners being deprived of dozens of millions of dollars of their ETH\u2074\u00b3.Protocol-level measures to ensure access to funds (or even revert malicious transactions) were proposed by affected parties. EIP999 became the go-to issue for arguing in favour of one camp or the other\u2074\u2074. TheDAO reaction had set a slippery precedent. Tense debate followed, but no compromise was achieved. If anything, the period helped popularise politics among common Etherians \u2014 that is, to turn network governance into a more inclusive practice. Initiatives like ETHPrize, the Fellowship of Ethereum Magicians and the Etherean message board started to pop up, aimed at better understanding shared visions and goals within the community.In 2018, capital once hungry for ICOs and new tokens has dried up. Projects shipping at the most consistent pace seem to be the ones on the #DecentralisedFinance sector, where a good part of founding technologies, surprise, has no native tokens attached\u00b9\u2074. Debt provision infrastructure, stablecoins, derivative instruments and non-custodial relayers have recaptured the attention of both big investors and the SEC (see the EtherDelta case)\u2074\u2075. This sub-sector is an evidence of the compounding effects at play when it comes to well-crafted, open source, modular building blocks.As a corollary of the increase in governance participation, observed (subjectively) throughout last year, the ethics of Ethereum became a more commonly discussed matter. At DevCon IV, in the end 2018, there was a whole track dedicated to \u201cSociety & Systems\u201d, heavily focused on inclusiveness.A few of Ethereum core contributors in Japan - via Aya Miyaguchi\u2019s Twitter.The latter part of 2018 was also marked by a convergence of ideas\u2074\u2076 between the Ethereum community and the RadicalXChange movement jumpstarted after the publication of \u201cRadical Markets\u201d by Eric Posner & Glen Weyl. Vitalik has engaged on refining concepts proposed in the book and co-authored a paper on \u201cLiberal Radicalism\u201d, exploring better mechanisms for funding public infrastructure\u2074\u2077.In short time, a tide of Ethereum-based applications incorporated \u201cradical\u201d notions like those of partially common property, self-assessed taxes and treating data production as labor\u2074\u2078. Submissions to recent hackathons reveal experiments for buying ad-placements, pixels in a map and domain names under a Harberger-tax-model\u2074\u2079. We may soon have a similar form of resource allocation being piloted in urban spaces with public art\u2075\u2070.As Weyl eloquently put, after his talk at the last DevCon, Ethereum is likely among the most \u201cserious, organized and broad-based movements for a positive, forward-looking, liberal vision of the future\u201d. It\u2019s use case has evolved to be \u201cless any particular technical question, and more [that of] offering a vision that can save us from returning to the 1930\u2019s next time we hit a recession\u201d. There\u2019s certain plutocratic aspects to the network, and a lot of design quirks to fix\u2026 but \u201cwhat other movement can introduce you to people of every creed and race from every continent united around the idea of decentralizing power\u201d\u00b2\u00b2?\ud83c\udfc1 ConclusionThe intention here was to depict overarching narratives driving the development of Ethereum over time. The chosen method was to chart community sentiment through an analysis of Reddit posts, discussions with early community members, documents, archived webpages, Github threads, DevPost submissions for hackathons, personal blog posts, recollections of major attitudes and media coverage along the years. Anyone who has been around long enough can perform a similar analysis.No statement is meant to be an absolute truth. The goal is to nudge people away from absolutism, and acknowledge that the identity of this community is vivid, even if far from solidified. It\u2019s fine to change one\u2019s mind in response to new evidence. Vitalik\u2019s \u201cthat didn\u2019t work!\u201d chorus in DevCon IV\u2019s \u201cBUIDL song\u201d was a powerful - yet kitschy - reminder.Bitcoin is commonly praised as a conservative organism. Ethereum is usually viewed as further down the spectrum, towards progressivism.Ethereum can be borderless crowdfunding and a revolution in access to finance. It can be the missing substrate for sovereign data markets to blossom. It can be the testbed for a desert city running on smart contracts.It can also be just a collective delusion around fantasies that stubbornly scale faster than reality. What is the vocation of this network, its asset, and its community, in the end?Vitalik has once noted that, \u201ccontra doctrinare libertarians, freedom is a high-dimensional space\u201d. Maybe Ethereum is a land in which to explore these dimensions.The chilling uncertainty, while a central point of critique to detractors, is precisely what makes supporters so excited about the future of Ether.Photo by Ahmed Carter on Unsplash\ud83d\udcdc References(under-read gems marked with \u201c\u2b50\u201d)\u00b9 Visions of Bitcoin (Nic Carter & Hasu).\u00b2 Market Narratives are Marketing: Introducing the Crypto Narrative Index (Nathaniel Whittemore).\u00b3 Ethereum Roadmap V4 (Ethereum.org, 2014).\u2074 Money Crypto vs. Tech Crypto (Erik Torenberg).\u2075 Vitalik Buterin Tells the Story of His Race With Vlad Zamfir to Implement Proof of Stake Casper (Trustnodes).\u2076 Vitalik Buterin reveals Ethereum at Bitcoin Miami 2014 (Ethereum Foundation, Youtube).\u2077 Bitcoin\u2019s most ambitious successor (Al Jazeera).\u2078 Bitcoin 2.0 (Bloomberg).\u2b50 \u2079 People\u2019s Republic of DOUG (Andreas Olofsson).\u2b50 \u00b9\u2070 State in A Box (Vinay Gupta).\u00b9\u00b9 The Story of TheDAO - it\u2019s History and Consequences (Samuel Falkon).\u00b9\u00b2 Has the Cryptocoin Market Met Its Match in the SEC?

Even though its price has been volatile, we think that its potential is enormous; big companies have integrated it into their operations, top universities have set up lectures about it, more and more bright minds are establishing progressive and disruptive companies based on it. Therefore, we think that the current price of Ethereum does not reflect its potential and real value.Many projects doing the ICO, including Signals, start a Token Sale by locking the token price in Ethereum according to the current rate USD/ETH 24 hours before the start of the sale. As many other alts, the Ethereum price is dropping, with the current value below $700 (ATH ~$1400) [30/3 update: ETH price is +- $390). Locking the price at $700 or lower amount could lead to an unfair situation during the 4 weeks of the main sale where investors get SGN tokens according to an Ethereum price locked at $700 when in that moment it is above $1000.To avoid this, and with the objective of having a fair and satisfactory Token Sale for everyone, we have decided to give you an advantage. We have decided to fix the price of Signals (SGN) token at an Ether price of $1,000, even though its current market value is approximately at $700.This decision also applies to our presale participants: We will give presale participants the same conditions when purchasing SGNs during the Token Sale. Although we\u2019re aware that our presale participants purchased tokens when the market price of Ethereum was significantly lower than $1,000, they will receive additional SGN tokens as if the price of ETH was at $1,000.What if Ethereum surpasses $1,000 during the Signals Token Sale?If the price of Ethereum rises even more during the Token Sale and it surpasses the price fixed at $1,000 at the beginning of the sale, the total market value of raised ETH will reach the $18,000,000 hard cap sooner. In this case, we will stop the sale immediately and redistribute the rest of the tokens to all Token Sale participants (respecting the discount they received when they bought SGNs). That\u2019s how we will ensure that even if the ETH value raises, the Token Sale will remain fair for all participants \u2014 including the first and the last participants, as well as participants from the pre-sale and the main sale.Read our blog posts to find out more about how to participate in the Signals Token Sale and how the first participants get the largest discounts.Signals Team", "responses": 9, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Initial Coin Offering", "ICO", "Ethereum", "Cryptocurrency"]}, {"title": "Etheremon: Decentralized World of Ether Monsters.", "post_link": "https://medium.com/etheremon/etheremon-decentralized-world-of-ether-monsters-a4f355971ea2?source=search_post", "author_name": "Etheremon", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@myetheremon", "publish_date": "2017-12-19", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-20", "readtime": "10.7", "claps": 2293, "voters": 156, "content": "Etheremon: Decentralized World of Ether Monsters.EtheremonFollowDec 19, 2017 \u00b7 11 min readETHEREMON is a decentralized application/blockchain game built on the Ethereum network. It simulates a world of ether monsters (Etheremon) where you can capture, trade and evolve Etheremon to defeat others.As a decentralized application, or dApp, no one controls the Etheremon world, and no one can take away your Etheremon or cheat you in this world. The game is immune to any outside influence as it\u2019s guaranteed to execute only what Etheremon\u2019s smart contracts were programmed to do. (The source code is verified and available for anyone to view. Nothing is hidden in this world). Moreover, because the Ethereum network runs on thousands of machines simultaneously, the services are provided with a 100% uptime guarantee.Etheremon can be traded or sold like any traditional collectible. Unlike traditional collectibles, in the Etheremon world, you can train your Etheremon, defeat others, and earn EMONT (an in-game currency ERC-20 token).1. Game ConceptGame players, or MonSeekers (refers to game players) interact with the smart contracts on the Ethereum network to achieve three goals:Capturing Etheremon limited virtual monsters issued on the Ethereum network, to complete your collections.Training Etheremon to lay eggs, transform them to new species to sell or lend them to other MonSeekers.Battling with other MonSeekers in various game modes (gym battle, castle battles, practice and tournaments) to collect EMONT (an in-game currency ERC-20 token).2. What do I need to play Etheremon?To interact with the Etheremon world, users need to interact with the Etheremon smart contracts. To interact with these contracts you need:An Ethereum wallet \u2014 which can be created with My Ether Wallet websiteand/or by using MetaMask.Ether \u2014 a form of digital payment to pay for your transactions. You can buy Ether from any available cryptocurrency exchange in your country.MetaMask or Mist browser (optional) \u2014 allows you to run Ethereum dApps right in your browser. If you do not want to use them, you can manually create transactions via My Ether Wallet website.3. EMONTEMONT is the in-game currency of Etheremon. Being an ERC20 token, it is transferable and limited. There are only 20 million EMONT created. They are distributed as follows:70% or 14 million: to be \u201cmined\u201d by players during in-game operations such as battling. After all tokens are mined, the game will be self-sustainable and operated entirely with EMONT tokens (no Ether is needed at that time).25% or 5 million: reserved for our User Growth Pool.5% or 1 million: reserved for the development team.4. Etheremon Species4.1 Etheremon AttributesMonSeekers start the game by catching Etheremon. If the Etheremon species are catchable (have not gone extinct), MonSeekers can catch them directly from our website by paying EMONT tokens or Ether. Otherwise, MonSeekers need to buy them from the player market.New Etheremon species are introduced by the Etheremon team, and will only be catchable for a limited time period. After that, MonSeekers can only buy those Etheremon from the player market. The number of those Etheremon can only be increased by Etheremon laying eggs.Battle Power (BP)Each Etheremon you catch has a battle power. Battle Power is a single, simplified value that encapsulates all six of an Etheremon\u2019s battle stats: Health Point (HP), Primary Attack (PA), Secondary Attack (SA), Primary Defense (PD), Secondary Defense (SD), and Speed (SP).Experience (EXP) can only be gained through battle. The higher EXP the higher level the Etheremon is. Etheremon at higher levels will have higher stats and are essentially stronger. Also, after reaching a certain level, some Etheremon will gain the ability to Transform.TypesEach Etheremon has 1 to 3 types. There are 17 types: insect, dragon, mystic, fire, phantom, earth, neutral, telepath, iron, lightning, combat, flyer, leaf, toxin, rock, water, ice. Each type has an advantage over another type. The diagram below reflects the relationships between types:AncestorsEach Etheremon has 1 to 3 ancestors (except Gen-0 Etheremon and Gasons).An ancestor increases their descendant\u2019s offensive stats in battle. For example, Cobrus has Mizumi, Chulember, and Vivorin as its ancestors. If Cobrus joins the battle with those Etheremon, its attack power is increased.MonSeekers can only transform an Etheremon if they have all of its ancestors.Generations Each Etheremon species belong to one generation. The generation is defined as follows:Gen-0 (also known as Legend) \u2014 This is a special generation. They do not have any ancestors and they cannot lay eggs. They are uncatchable, so the number of gen-0 monsters is limited can only be bought via the player market.Gen-x \u2014 The generation of Etheremon (other than Gen-0) is based on the following calculation: Etheremon Gen = highest ancestor Gen + 1. For example, Pudde has Eakape, Vermillios and Mirrie as its ancestors. Eakape is Gen-0, Vermillios is Gen-0 and Mirrie is Gen-1. Hence, Pudde is Gen-2Gason There is a special class called Gason. When a Gason is in your party, it increases the defensive stats for all Etheremon of the same type. Gasons do not have ancestors, only one form, and cannot lay eggs. This Etheremon class can always be caught in the store.4.2 Etheremon Egg LayingSome Etheremon can lay eggs at a certain level (excluding Gasons and Legends).The egg laying level for each type of Etheremon is different. for example, a Cobrus can lay eggs at level 30, while a Pudde can lay eggs at level 28.After laying eggs, the level of an Etheremon will be reduced by a certain amount. For example, after a Cobrus at lays an egg it will have its level reduced to 27.An egg needs to be hatched to become an Etheremon. One trainer can hatch one egg at a time. The time to hatch an egg is randomized, from a few hours to a few days.4.3 Etheremon TransformationSome Etheremon can transform at a certain level.After transforming, an Etheremon\u2019s level will be reset to 1 and all of its stats (HP, PA, PD, SA, SD, SP) are greatly increased comparing to a level-1 untransformed counterpart.To transform an Etheremon, trainers need to collect all of its ancestors.After transforming, some Etheremon can lay eggs of its current transformed form after reaching a certain level. This level will be higher than that of its previous form. For example, after transforming a Cobrus to Dracobra, you will need to train that Dracobra from level 1 to level 40. At that level, Dracobra can lay eggs and those eggs will hatch into a new Dracobra.5. Battle Game RulesBattling is one of the most important and exciting aspects of the Etheremon World. There are a few battle modes under development. Three of them are released: Castle Mode, Gym Mode, and Practice Mode.5.1 Castle ModeIn the Etheremon World, there are special locations called hills where you can build and defend your own castle. A total of 30 hills have been discovered in the World. Ever since their discovery, MonSeekers have been battling non-stop to claim the hills and train their Etheremon.Building and defending a castleOn an empty hill, you can build a castle by hiring a Blockid builder squad at the cost of at least 0.02 ether or 15 EMONT for 5 bricks.For each battle lost, the castle is damaged and loses 1 brick. For each battle won, the castle owner is rewarded 1 EMONT. However, the number of rewarded EMONT cannot be higher than the number of bricks.For every 8 battles won, the castle receives an extra honor brick from the squad of Blockid builders. However, the total number of honor bricks cannot be higher than the number of bricks.Once the number of bricks drops to 0, the castle falls and is destroyed.You can strengthen your castle at the beginning by building it with more bricks (1 extra brick = 0.004 eth or 3 EMONT).To defend your castle, you form a team of 3 Etheremon called fighters with up to 3 other Etheremon called supporters. Supporters should be gasons or ancestors of fighters used to increase defensive and offensive stats.Attacking a castle You can attempt to take down a castle by launching attacks to reduce its bricks. Your attacking team will also consist of 3 fighters and up to 3 supporters. Each time you win an attack on a castle you will be rewarded 1 EMONT. You cannot attack castles who\u2019s average level is much lower than your fighter\u2019s average level.The main game In an Etheremon battle, each team will consist of 3 fighters and up to 3 supporters. Fighters will fight each other respectively based on their positions: first vs first, second vs second, and third vs third. In each matchup, a series of one-on-one fights between members of the opposing teams are automatically simulated in our smart contract according to the following rules:The Etheremon take turns attacking. The one with higher speed attacks first.Primary Defense reduces the damage of incoming Primary Attack, Secondary Defense reduces the damage of incoming Secondary Attack.During a turn, whichever attack (either Primary or Secondary Attack) that results in the greatest total damage to the defender will be performed by the fighter, reducing the defender\u2019s HP.Each attack, the fighter may land a \u201ccritical attack\u201d. This means its Primary/Secondary Attack will be much higher than normal. Critical attacks are triggered randomly.The first Etheremon to lose all of its HP loses the fight.The winning Etheremon is rewarded with a large amount of experience while the losing Etheremon gains experience of a lesser amount.The remaining fighters will continue the battle.There are a total of 3 matchups, and the team which triumph in 2 or more matchups wins the overall battle.Supporters Each team consists of up to 3 supporters. They can be fighters ancestors or gasons.A supporting ancestor increases all of its descendant\u2019s offensive stats by 10% (e.g: Primary Attack & Secondary Attack increased by 10%). This effect repeats if there are multiple ancestors. For example, if there are 2 ancestors of the attacking Etheremon present, Primary & Secondary Attack is increased by 20%.A supporting gason increases all of its type\u2019s defensive stats by 10%(e.g: Primary Defense & Secondary Defense increased by 10%).For example: Pudde is in the battle team and supporters are Mushmite,Vermillios, and Mirrie. Pudde\u2019s offensive stats are increased by 20% and defensive stats are increased by 10%.Notes: multiple ancestors of the same kind or multiple gason of the same types are counted as one. For example, if you put three Polynimos as supporters, any fighters with the fire type receive a 10% increase in defensive stats (instead of 30%).TypesWhen an Etheremon is battling another Etheremon that it has type advantage over, its offensive stats are increased by 20%.EXP Gain Experience gain is calculated in each matchup based mostly on the level of the opposing Etheremon. The higher the level of the opponent, the more experience your Etheremon can gain. For example, a level 1 Etheremon needs around 3.22 wins against other level-1s to level up. A level 10 Etheremon needs 5.8 wins against other level 10s, but 15.6 wins against level 5s or 42.4 wins against level 1s.A loss also gives EXP equal to 1/3 the amount of experience from a win.5.2 Gym ModeGym mode serves as a bridge to Castle Mode, allowing newly caught Etheremon to be trained efficiently as well as lowering the barrier to entry for new players.Gym\u2019s rules are simple:There are 9 non-player-character Etheremon (the trainers) in the gym.To begin training, select one of your Etheremon (the trainee), 3 trainers and their level (from 1 to 5).The trainee will battle the trainer one by one for a total of 3 matchupsMatchup\u2019s rules are the same as in Castle Mode, except without Gason and Ancestors. Experience gained is roughly 70% of Castle Mode\u2019s.5.3 Practice ModePractice Mode allows players to attack castles when gas prices are very high and the cost to battle becomes too great.By paying a 0.005 ETH fee (the price is subject to change) you manage to largely cut down your gas expenses.Battle Mode requires 900'000 wei gas limit and lets you attack only one castle. Practice Mode allows you to fight five castles at the same time while keeping your transaction gas limit less than or equal to 300'000 wei.For the defending castle owner, Practice Mode increases economic incentive to own castles. In battle mode castle owners are rewarded mostly with passive EXP. Attackers could abuse their choice of castles and quickly destroy them to obtain the 1 EMONT winner reward.Practice mode removes this defender disadvantage. A castle\u2019s durability does not decrease after a failed defense. A successful defense gains the owner 0.25 EMONT regardless of the outcome. Technically, your castle can now remain up for an unlimited amount of attacks and continue rewarding you with EMONT.Castle owners do not gain any EXP for being attacked in this mode, however. If you want to grind EXP fast, you still need either to defend in Battle Mode or attack in Practice Mode.Practice mode is very similar to battle mode. One key difference is you are attacking 5 different castles at once with your team.Select your fighters and supporters.Select the castle which you would like to go up against.Once you are done with preparations, press the \u201cStart Practice\u201d button and finalize the transaction.6. RoadmapThe Etheremon project is divided into three major phases:Phase 1: [released]All the fundamental game features are implemented and successfully released to the Ethereum mainnet. MonSeekers can catch an Etheremon, train it to lay eggs, transform it to new species or defeat others to earn EMONT. The marketplace is also opened for MonSeekers to buy, sell, lend and borrow their Etheremon.The first two battle modes, castle & gym, have been introduced to MonSeekers. Thousands of battles have occurred in a matter of weeks, making Etheremon poised to be the most popular blockchain games of 2018!Phase 2: [under development]In this phrase, we will focus on developing new game modes:P2P playing mode: MonSeekers can battle 1-on-1 by sending a challenge letter.Leagues and tournaments: Thousands of MonSeekers can play together and compete to win valuable prizes.Adventure mode: hunt and explore the virtual world to seek for new Etheremon.VR technology will be applied to bring users the best gaming experience. Check out our Medium for more news about Etheremon\u2019s partnership with Decentraland.Moreover, off-chain scaling solution will be introduced to deal with the issue of scalability.Phase 3: [under development]In phase 3, we will focus on building up The EMON Alliance. By providing easy-to-use SDKs and share our experience on crypto game development, we want to connect and encourage other game developers to implement their own crypto games or provide a new battle mode for Etheremon.\u2014 \u2014 \u2014Follow us atWebsite: https://www.etheremon.com/Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/etheremon/Twitter: https://twitter.com/myetheremonReddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/etheremon/Discord: https://discord.gg/xgJpuzcTelegram: https://t.me/myetheremonEmail: contact@etheremon.com", "responses": 11, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Etheremon", "Decentralized Game", "English", "Guides And Tutorials"]}, {"title": "Ether (ETH) Bearish Thesis: The \u201cFlippening\u201d of Market Irrationality", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@tetrascapital/ether-eth-bearish-thesis-the-flippening-of-market-irrationality-8633e70ab498?source=search_post", "author_name": "Tetras Capital", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@tetrascapital", "publish_date": "2018-07-16", "last_modified_date": "2018-07-17", "readtime": "3.04", "claps": 1723, "voters": 158, "content": "Ether (ETH) Bearish Thesis: The \u201cFlippening\u201d of Market IrrationalityTetras CapitalFollowJul 16, 2018 \u00b7 4 min readDisclaimerOverviewOver the last year, crypto-asset markets have run wild on the thesis that value accrues to the \u201cinfrastructure layer of blockchains\u201d. We now see nearly every project in the space define themselves as the blockchain infrastructure for XYZ industry, and the valuations of nearly all the tokens native to these networks have skyrocketed as a result.Entrepreneurs are flocking to build decentralized communities, blockchains, and tokens where they are not only unnecessary but, in some cases, detrimental to the system they are meant to underpin. Uncertainty around regulation and value capture is orders of magnitude higher in the crypto-asset space than with traditional equity investments, yet, almost absurdly, crypto-asset valuations have ascended higher in comparison.Ethereum and its native asset, Ether (ETH), sit at the center of this mania.The recent decline in ETH\u2019s price suggests that the speculation that drove it to new heights over the past year is exhausting. Just as ETH benefited from irrational exuberance, it will inevitably suffer further as the market sobers up.We believe that ETH\u2019s current price is still significantly overvalued; still significantly decoupled from the Ethereum network\u2019s current and near-term technological state. Our research has led us to believe that the market and technology is still far too immature to justify current valuations. This nascent asset class has taken off due to speculative narratives, and we believe that the current marketplace is not sophisticated enough to properly evaluate risks or general economic concerns.On the surface, some of the Ethereum ecosystem\u2019s key performance indicators (KPIs) have been promising. As of July 2018, ETH\u2019s market cap was roughly $45 billion. Ethereum currently supports thousands of ERC20 tokens (35 of which are worth greater than $100 million) and over 1,500 decentralized application (DApp) projects. The Ethereum network currently processes roughly 750k transactions per day.The network is seeing some genuine demand, but we believe that this demand is far from sufficient to justify ETH\u2019s price. When there is an expectation that a crypto-asset can achieve/exceed a trillion dollar market cap, the asset must become some reserve store of value (SoV). We believe ETH lacks the crucial characteristics required for a dominant SoV, and we see a low probability of ETH taking the reign from the current crypto-asset leader, BTC \u2014 let alone from incumbent globally dominant assets like the USD and Gold.Whatever the probability, ETH\u2019s chance at becoming a reserve SoV in the future will depend heavily on it being tremendously successful at one of its main use cases:A decentralized application platformA capital raising platformUpon digging deeper, we currently see Ethereum struggling at both:The platform has severe issues on technical and decentralizationfronts (both architecturally and politically) that will persist both over the short and long term. These issues question its value proposition over cheaper, more efficient, less risky application platforms.The commoditization of capital raising is already eating away at the main source of genuine ETH demand. Additionally, (incoming) regulation surrounding ICOs will severely curtail this demand.While Ethereum\u2019s current \u201cbrand name\u201d edge may continue for some time, it has yet to solidify any functional competitive advantages.Understanding the imminence of key catalysts, Tetras began building an ETH short position in May 2018. Although we do believe a naked short was justified, the primary motivation for this short position was to hedge a core long position in BTC. As mentioned in all our updates since the start of the year, we believe the next, sustained crypto bull market will be led by BTC.Shorting ETH is an ideal strategy for hedging out overall crypto market risk because:ETH has minimal \u201cbreaking news risk\u201d that can move the price unexpectedlyETH is the asset and Ethereum is the ecosystem we understand best behind BitcoinETH has a mature enough market to facilitate reasonable borrow termsWe believe the coming months will be extremely telling for Ethereum\u2019s future. Network strain (from DApp usage), competition (from alternative DApp platforms), and regulation (towards ICOs) will test the speculative hype and price of ETH.Full PaperRead The Full Paper:Ether (ETH) Bearish Thesis: The \u201cFlippening\u201c of Market IrrationalityTetras Capital Ethereum AnalysisDisclaimer", "responses": 6, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Cryptocurrency", "Blockchain", "Bitcoin", "Investing"]}, {"title": "Generating Design System Spacing", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@ethersystem/generating-design-system-spacing-aa69714160bc?source=search_post", "author_name": "Ether", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@ethersystem", "publish_date": "2017-12-08", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-16", "readtime": "5.2", "claps": 897, "voters": 161, "content": "Generating Design System SpacingHow we created a spacing system that aligned our teams and related to our designs in a meaningful way.EtherFollowDec 8, 2017 \u00b7 6 min readWe\u2019ve gone over how we tackle colors and typography in our design systems at The Scenery, so now we turn our attention to the system that goes largely unnoticed (because it\u2019s not really there): spacing.Before we begin, it\u2019s best to define what a spacing system should do. At its most basic level, a spacing system should define the distance between elements and components. And it should always be a full system itself\u2014trying to couple spacing to type or nesting it inside components is a recipe for disaster and developer overwrites.As far as goals go, your spacing system should be\u20261. Easily defined and applied to designs2. Understood by designers and developers alike3. Able to change without breakingTo define a spacing system that achieves these, we started with a core question, \u201cWhat should spacing really be based on?\u201dAll Your Base Are Belong to UsThere are a myriad of ways to define your spacing system\u2019s core units of measurement, but which one is really the best? To find out, let\u2019s explore some of the popular options we\u2019ve used in the past (in order of when we thought they were the bees-knees).Base-10Old faithful. Base-10 is prevalent for two main reasons. One, it is the number of fingers and toes most people have. Two, it is easy to use. Aside from that there\u2019s little reason to use base-10 spacing other than our sense of nostalgia (and the fact that in Sketch the default big-nudge is 10px).Verdict: Arbitrary at best, but math is easy!EmsNow we\u2019re talking. Ems make great spacers because they\u2019re an abstraction based on the font size. They\u2019re also terrible because they\u2019re an abstraction based on the font size. Designers and developers both love ems because of their ease of use and flexibility, but they fail in one core area: they\u2019re variable.In one of our biggest systems to date, we started our spacing system with the caveat that space could be defined absolutely with pixels or with ems, based on context.Here\u2019s what happened: designers couldn\u2019t understand how the ems were used, do the math in their heads to translate ems to px, and then use those values consistently in their design flats. It was a nightmare, so we pulled the em-based spacers and moved to absolute ones that could be symbolized in Sketch, shared, and implemented without fail.What we learned is that a variable spacing system is nice in theory but an absolute pain when applied at scale across a large team (and product).Verdict: Great idea, but the designers will stage a coup.Base-8Tired of base-10? Try 8! It\u2019s like 10, but more divisible. Base-8 is actually far more useful than base-10 as far as systems go. It provides great options for scaling up that are largely divisible by 2, 3, and 4, and matches up with base font-sizes. It\u2019s also a highly used scale when it comes to core UI elements like iconography.If you\u2019re going to choose a simple mathematical value-based spacer system, this is the best one so far. It\u2019s quickly becoming industry standard, thanks primarily to its use in Material Design. But something about it still seemed really arbitrary to us, so we kept thinking.Verdict: Better than anything else so far.Just Not Our TypeNot ones to settle \u2014 we have authority issues as a whole \u2014 we decided to take a step back and think about what concept should define the space around our system\u2019s components. Then we realized we could base it on the stuff that makes up 98% of our system: our system\u2019s type.Enter, the ex unit.The ex unit is a hardly-used CSS unit tied to the very thing we want spacing to relate to: typography. And not just type, the x-height of type, which varies wildly from typeface to typeface, even when the base font size remains the same. Using this unit, we are able to spec spacing components that relate directly to the fonts in our UI, creating a harmonious design that uses classical design theory \u2014 not an arbitrary number.Even more beneficial is the fact that the unit is wildly flexible. Now, when you go to change your system\u2019s core body copy from Brandon to Avenir you won\u2019t have to rework your whole spacing system because everything feels gigantic. The unit is built to mitigate the pain of change across your system, and that is something we can get behind for any part of our system.Verdict: related to our core type while being super flexible to work with. Winner.Now that we\u2019ve found a base that achieves our goals, we need to tackle the next aspect of spacing: the sizes themselves.Generating Spacing SizesSpacing sizes are just like any other design system component \u2014 too many variations and they will be used inconsistently, too few and your system will become fragile, breaking under the stress of scale. The goal for us in defining spacing sizes is to define them in a way that strikes a balance between those two extremes.To do this we created a philosophy: each spacer size should be meaningfully different than the ones bracketing it.What is a meaningful space? This probably sounds like an ontological question. We might as well be asking what the meaning of life is, as well as our various spacer sizes. But surprisingly, we found our solution to defining what a meaningful difference really is in a place we have consistently derided as both pretentious and self-gratifying. We use a Fibonacci sequence.Everyone has seen Dribbble posts where a designer has magnificently aligned their vector shapes to the golden rule in the name of classical design-theory and virtue. This is not that.The Fibonacci sequence does one thing very well: it differentiates steps so they are at least as far away as the step preceding them. In short, it enforces meaningful change between steps. If you were going to use this sequence for anything that aligns to its core principle, applying it to spacing would be it.When we take our ex units and apply a Fibonacci sequence we get something beautiful in its simplicity, but powerful in its relation to the rest of our design system.See the codepen exampleThis system is fantastic for the same three reasons we stated at the beginning:1. It is easily defined, and applied to designs (thanks, Fibonacci and Sketch symbols)2. It can be understood by designers and developers alike (thanks, absolute sizes)3. It can change without breaking (thanks, ex unit)Naming Your SizesSince the exact pixel value of the spacer can change, we use abstractions for our spacing names. These could either be a numeric scale (sp-1, sp-2, sp-3, etc) or t-shirt sizes (xs, s, m, l, xl, etc). This allows our spacing system to flex on specific sizing of each step, while maintaining the integrity of the codebase.We opt for the t-shirt sizes in our systems. They help relate the general size of the space while still giving developers and designers a clear delineated path through the sizes of the system. And since the sequence isn\u2019t open to half-measures we don\u2019t have to worry about someone trying to insert the dreaded \u201csmedium\u201d size into the system at some point.With this core process powering your system spacing, you\u2019ll be set up for the future with a core that changes gracefully, relates perfectly to your designs, and isn\u2019t just based on your own two hands.Ether is coming soon.

It\u2019s not based on fact, assumes that the only function of Ether is to pay network transaction fees (gas), and is misleading for a number of other reasons.In this essay, I will explain why Ether has value for substantially more reasons than just being used to pay transaction fees on the Ethereum network and I\u2019ll also showcase how Ether is being used as money for the new Ethereum digital economy.Let\u2019s start by exploring why Ether is valuable.What gives Ether value?Ether, the native currency of the Ethereum network, derives its value from a myriad of different factors. It is used within the Ethereum network to perform a range of functions, including:used to pay Ethereum transaction fees (in the form of \u2018gas\u2019)used as collateral for a wide range of open finance applications (MakerDAO, Compound)can be lent or borrowed (Dharma)accepted as payment at certain retailers and service providersused to as a medium of exchange to purchase Ethereum-based tokens (via ICOs or exchanges), crypto-collectibles, in-game items, and other non-fungible tokens (NFTs)earned as a reward for completing bounties (Gitcoin, Bounties Network)Furthermore, in Ethereum 2.0 (Serenity), users will be able to become a validator and help secure the network by providing computational resources and locking up 32 Ether per validator. Due to this, it is expected that Proof of Stake will lock a substantial amount of the circulating supply of Ether. There are also discussions around introducing a \u2018fee-burn\u2019 model where a percentage of Ether used to pay transaction fees would be \u2018burned\u2019 and thus reduce the circulating supply of Ether.In addition to utility value, Ether also has speculative value. This is value that is derived from speculative activities (such as trading and investing) which currently accounts for most of the value behind all crypto-assets. As observed in 2017, crypto-assets can attract substantial speculative interest, with some assets increasing in value by 1000x over just a few months. This speculative interest often brings fresh capital into the ecosystem that can be reinvested into various verticals, but it can be damaging to the short-term market sentiment of all crypto-assets.Can tokens on Ethereum be used instead of Ether?Theoretically, yes. Practically, no. The concept of using another asset to secure the Ethereum network is called \u2018economic abstraction\u2019 (a good primer can be found here). This would involve miners / validators accepting tokens other than Ether in exchange for adding valid transactions to new blocks.It is highly unlikely that the Ethereum protocol will ever implement economic abstraction as it could potentially reduce the security of the blockchain by compromising the value of Ether.How does valuable Ether help to secure the network?In Proof of Work systems, miners compete with each other to find a block and thus be rewarded for their work (in the form of the native crypto-asset of the protocol). As the price of the asset increases, it naturally brings with it more miners, which then increases the network difficulty. As the network difficulty increases, it becomes increasingly difficult for miners to find a block which results in large scale mining operations (commonly referred to as \u201cmining farms\u201d) being one of the only profitable ways to mine on a Proof of Work network (once it reaches a certain size). Miners can also join \u2018mining pools\u2019 in order to increase their chances of finding a block and thus increase their rewards.It would currently cost an individual or group a large amount of money to successfully attack or take control of either the Bitcoin or Ethereum PoW blockchains.When Ethereum transitions to Proof of stake under Ethereum 2.0, it is expected that users will be able to stake 32 Ether per validator and receive rewards for their work in the form of additional Ether (at a dynamic issuance rate , discussed later in this essay).Under Proof of Stake, the cost of attacking Ethereum will be tied to the cost of Ether. Instead of using energy intensive mining (as it is under Proof of Work), validators will \u201cstake\u201d Ether, and will lose part or all of their stake if they attempt to behave fraudulently. The more validators with staked Ether securing the network, the more Ether an attacker would need to purchase in order to carry out an attack. Such an attack would likely rapidly increase the price of Ether and thus make it prohibitively more expensive for the attacker.What the Ethereum network securesThe Ethereum network currently secures billions of dollars in value including: utility tokens, work tokens, crypto-collectibles (and other NFTs), Dai (through collateralization of CDPs), asset-backed securities, among many other things.If we expect a decentralized financial system to grow and one day usurp the existing system, we must have guarantees that the Ethereum network is sufficiently able to secure trillions of dollars of value and be incredibly resistant to change.Ethereum 2.0 (Serenity) favours liveness over safety. What this means is that the protocol should be able to function even if the majority of validators go offline (such as a catastrophic event like World War 3). This level of liveness can be achieved if Ether is sufficiently valuable (in order to incentivize people to continue running their validators).What is money?There are many examples throughout history of various objects being used as money \u2014 seashells, gold coins, paper notes and many more. Humans used these things as money because they had perceived value based upon their difficulty to counterfeit, their scarcity and the fact that they were accepted as money. In modern times, commodities such as gold are not used as money because it is not considered a medium of exchange, even though gold is still considered quite valuable.Money is primarily a social contract. Fiat money, the current form of money used by most of the world, is backed by a given nation\u2019s government. The government decrees that a particular currency (USD, AUD, JPY) is to be used as legal tender (the accepted money) for their nation and, most importantly, what the government accepts as payments for tax. Typically, the government controls the supply of the money and can create additional money at will.Fiat money is a delicate construct \u2014 if managed incorrectly, it can have dire consequences for a nation (such as what has happened in Venezuela). Even though some governments are quite powerful and influential, a mere decree that something is money is not enough \u2014 the citizens must collectively believe that the money has actual value and that it will not be diluted by extreme inflation.Is Ether money?In order for something to function as money within an economy, it needs to act as a good medium of exchange (MoE), unit of account (UoA) and store of value (SoV). Ether is used as a medium of exchange within the Ethereum economy for a wide range of apps, with dApp providers accepting it in exchange for fungible / non-fungible tokens, or other services. It is also used as a unit of account by various parties (including companies that have raised Ether via ICOs). Finally, Ether has historically been used as a store of value, with investors and speculators purchasing Ether to hold for investment purposes, given its relative scarcity, predictable supply growth, and inherent utility.An object (physical or digital) must typically exhibit five distinct attributes in order to be considered money: portability, durability, divisibility, fungibility and established history (lindy effect). Ether is highly portable (because it\u2019s digital), durable (again, because it\u2019s digital), divisible (up to 18 decimal places), but has limited fungibility as ETH tokens are interchangeable with one another, but accounts/addresses can be blacklisted quite easily. Privacy protocols such as zk-SNARKs will eventually improve this property for Ethereum.Ethereum has been in operation since 2015 and continues to build a strong established history. The Ethereum network (and Ether) have functioned as expected for 99.99% of its life. The other 0.01% includes surviving The DAO, multiple large hacks of smart contracts, multiple protocol-level exploits, the Shanghai DoS attacks, constant negative remarks from the wider crypto community and multiple bear markets (including a recent 94% drop in price).On top of this, Ether has additional properties such as being censorship-resistant, permission-less, pseudonymous and interoperable with other crypto-networks.The supply scheme of crypto-assets is hotly debated among various parties (especially those in the Bitcoin community) and there are currently two main approaches: a capped supply (like Bitcoin) or a low, predictable and hard to change issuance rate (like what is planned for Ethereum 2.0).In Ethereum 2.0 (with Sharding and Proof of Stake implemented), while a low inflation rate will always guarantee the validators are rewarded for securing the network, it suffers from the fact that it may dilute the value of Ether for those that are not validators. Though, this is offset by Ether being taken out of the circulating supply through staking, various open finance applications, fee burning, and people simply losing access to their Ether.Supporting Data (as of 7/01/2019)Ethers money-like properties can be tracked via many different metrics:Ethereum has an average of $2 billion USD of exchange volume every 24 hoursOver 1.8 million ether is currently being used to secure MakerDAO CDPsA further ~40,000 ether is locked in various finance appsThe Ethereum network is processing an average of 600,000 transactions per dayAn average of 250,000 active addresses per dayGas usage is at capacity (which means Ethereum is being used for more than just simple sends)Thousands of companies have raised billions of dollars by issuing tokens via an ICO on EthereumThe expected issuance rate of EtherAs of time of writing, Ether\u2019s annual issuance rate is around 7%. In January of 2019, the Constantinople upgrade will go live on the Ethereum network bringing with it a reduction in block rewards from 3 ETH per block to 2 ETH per block (and an additional drop in uncle block rewards). This will reduce the overall annual network issuance rate to around 4.5%.In Ethereum 2.0 Phase 0, due to the beacon chain running in parallel to the Eth1.0 chain, there will be a slight bump in issuance rate (potentially from 4.5% to 5%). In Phase 2, the Eth1.0 chain will be deprecated and the network issuance rate will dramatically fall to the planned target of <1%.https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-basics/monetary-policyThere will be a sliding scale between the total amount of Ether at stake and annual interest earned by stakers. The current Ethereum 2.0 spec would produce the following annual interest and inflation numbers based on total network stake:https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/serenity-phases/eth-2.0-economicsYou\u2019ll notice in the table above that the issuance rate for the network is substantially lower than the validator interest rate.ConclusionAs I\u2019ve shown in this post, Ether is being used for substantially more than just the paying of transaction fees for the Ethereum network. Due to this, Ether has managed to accrue significant value over its short life-span and has begun to take on money-like properties.I expect Ether will continue to be used as the native digital money for the Ethereum open economy and as that economy continues to grow, so too will the demand for Ether.Special thanks to DCInvestor, Eric Conner, Chaz Schmidt, Ryan Sean Adams, and Cyrus Younessi for providing suggestions/feedback for this piece.DisclaimerNothing in this piece should be considered investment advice.", "responses": 4, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Ethereum", "Cryptocurrency", "Crypto"]}, {"title": "Ethereum Multi-Signature Wallets.", "post_link": "https://medium.com/hellogold/ethereum-multi-signature-wallets-77ab926ab63b?source=search_post", "author_name": "Dave Appleton", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@Dave_Appleton", "publish_date": "2017-06-25", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-18", "readtime": "7.07", "claps": 728, "voters": 141, "content": "Ethereum Multi-Signature Wallets.Dave AppletonFollowJun 25, 2017 \u00b7 8 min readIf you have been dealing with crypto currencies for a while, you will have heard about \u201cMulti-Sig Wallets\u201d being used to safeguard ether or tokens held by an entity \u2014 often as the result of an ICO. They are used for several reasons, the foremost of these beingTo stop one person from running off with the lootTo reduce key person risk in case one person is incapacitated or loses their keys.So, you\u2019ve just raised 10,000 Ether in an ICO, you\u2019re thinking that it sounds like a good idea. Next you start trying to figure out what one is and how to use it.When I first heard of multi-sig wallets I was puzzled and thought of a group of people sitting around a computer or mobile device waiting for their turn to key in a password. Hey we are the blockchain generation! It\u2019s decentralised. Your multi-sig wallet is a smart contract living on the blockchain!Each of the wallet\u2019s users can be in a different location in different timezones. The weird bit is that they each have to use a normal wallet to talk to the multi-sig wallet.We will go through the basics and then see examples of following these steps using the Parity Wallet. You can use almost any wallet but the Parity wallet is BIG and FRIENDLY which suits me for this tutorial. If you are having trouble and want to see some of the basics on another wallet tell me in the comments.The BasicsAt its core, a multi-signature wallet needsA list of people who are allowed to do thingsRules on how many of those people have to agree before it happensA way to receive ETHERA way to submit a requestA way to agree to a request (and submit it if you are last)A way to re-submit the request if it failsThere are a load of nice to have as well, but that is enough to get started.The first two rules have to be decided right at the beginningSay we have Tom, Dick and Harry sharing their funds and they decide that any two if them can decide to spend some Ether, we would right at the beginning deploy a smart wallet with Tom, Dick and Harry as the owners and the number TWO as the requirement (we need TWO approvals). We can carry on using this wallet as long as we are happy with these conditions.Simple eh?Receiving EtherOnce the multi-sig wallet has been deployed, Ether can be sent to it just like to any other Ethereum address.Submitting a requestEvery transaction in Ethereum consists ofwho it\u2019s intended for (an Ethereum address)the amount of Ether (if any) it carries (in Wei*)special data*1 Ether = 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 WeiThese values are not to be confused with things like gasLimit and gasPrice which user use to submit the transaction but are not part of the actual transaction.example : To send 10 Ether to Alice,to: 0x31EFd75bc0b5fbafc6015Bd50590f4fDab6a3F22 *value : 10,000,000,000,000,000,000*ok \u2014 I lied, that\u2019s not Alice\u2019s address, it\u2019s mine. Contributions gratefully accepted \ud83d\ude10If you want to call a function on a contract you need to add some data e.g. to call a function finalize() on a contract at address 0xf09bEda21EFd99bc7719E284696f4f8471d0286C you would send a transaction like this:to: 0xf09bEda21EFd99bc7719E284696f4f8471d0286Cvalue: 0data: 0x4bb278f3Don\u2019t worry about how to find the data, I will give an example later.Your multi-sig wallet will have a function on it with a name like function submitTransaction(address destination, uint value, bytes data)So you have enough information to call this function once you have setup your wallet to talk to the multi-sig.Once Tom has submitted, in his generosity submitTransaction(0x31EFd75bc0....fDab6a3F22,1000000000,)he will get a message back from his wallet with a number or hash code which is the transactionID. Tom has to communicate this transactionID to Dick or Harry to get them to confirm it.Confirming the transactionWhen either Harry or Dick receive the transactionID from Tom, they should use the transactionID to review the transaction data, then they can confirm it by callingfunction confirmTransaction(uint transactionId)In our case, with the required amount of signatories being set to two, that would cause the transaction to be sent.If we had a higher number of signatures required, the person whose confirmation caused that requirement to be met would cause it to be executed.What if it fails?There are numerous reasons why you could fail to send the transaction. The most obvious is that you do not have enough Ether to send. The multi-sig wallet should give you the opportunity to retry the transaction.Is that it?No, of course it isn\u2019t. If you had such a wallet you would have a load of administration things and \u201cwhat-if\u2019s\u201d that need handling which I will address in part II of the article. For now, let\u2019s see how this all works with just these functions. I will look at it using Parity for the moment :Deploying the walletI downloaded the following multi-sig wallet: https://github.com/gnosis/MultiSigWallet/blob/master/contracts/MultiSigWallet.solNext I booted up the Kovan Testnet. Let\u2019s see how the selected contract helps us by deploying it from Parity\u2019s web interface*. I am assuming that you have already downloaded the file from Github. Select develop from the contracts tab.click on DEVELOP*Parity\u2019s web interface is at at http://127.0.0.1:8180Next click \u201cimport\u201d and import the contract file into Parity. The contract will be compiled automatically. Remember to save it.Now click on the \u201cDeploy\u201d button.Don\u2019t be alarmed by the warning. Just enter a name for the wallet and select the account to launch it from.Next you will be asked to supply the signees.Nobody is included by default, not even the person launching the contract .Click on the \u201c+\u201d sign to add signees (owners). Note that once you have entered the required number of signees and, of course, enough actual signees, the warning bar will disappear.Note : The person deploying the contract is not automatically a signatoryNow click on \u201cCreate\u201d and, once you have signed the transaction, your wallet will be ready for action.You can look at the properties of the wallet \u2014 check who the owners are, how many signatures are required etc. from the properties page of the contract. You can also send Ether to the wallet. Any Ether sent will be reflected at the top of the wallet :Proposing a transactionTom, Dick and Harry need to be watching the multi-sig contract. In order for this to happen, the person who generated the contract must shareThe Address of the contractThe ABI (Application Binary Interface)You can find both of these by inspecting the deployed contract on the machine that deployed it.Once you are watching the contract you can click on the \u201cexecute\u201d icon to execute the contract\u2019s functions. Select submitTransactionEnter (or select from your address book) the destination and value. If you are sending Ether, leave the data field empty (0x).Sign and submit the transaction. The contract will now show the result in as two events, a submission and a single confirmation:Confirming the transaction\u2026Tom tells Dick that he has submitted a transaction to send 1.2 Eth to the Test Address and needs it confirmed. Dick, not trusting Tom an inch checks the contract. He sees that there is ONE pending transaction :Anyway, Dick can also see the events so he knows it is Transaction Id 0 so he checks the transaction:Satisfied, Dick confirms and the transaction (id=0)And the transaction will be confirmed and the Ether sent.Let\u2019s check\u2026.Hang on! The transaction was confirmed but the execution failed! Why? A quick check (see above) reveals that the contract does not have enough Ether in to to pay \u201ctest Address\u201d his 1.2 Ether. Sending more Ether to the contract should solve that\u2026Somebody needs to ask the wallet to try again. It can be any of the signatories.The person holding the \u201ctest Address\u201d account will now see their funds arrive:And Tom, Dick and Harry will see the success in the event list of the contract:Coming Soon\u2026In part TWO I will look at some of the administrative functions of the contract.

The views expressed here should not be construed as investment advice.The Great (Store of Value) DebateOver the past few weeks it has been fascinating to observe the debate heating up over the likelihood of Bitcoin or Ether becoming a global monetary non-sovereign store of value that could be worth tens of trillions. While there are extremely intelligent and passionate people on both sides, there seems to be a tangible shift of Ethereum proponents evolving their beliefs towards Bitcoin as the more likely candidate to become sound money. This raises important questions for the viability and security of smart contract platforms in a future scenario where their native assets are not held as a monetary store of value.At the same time, we continue to see significant growth and activity (#BUIDLING) in the Ethereum ecosystem with new financial primitives and infrastructure that show promise of creating enormous economic value. The crucial question is whether some proportion of the value of economic activity on top of it will be captured in the price of Ether. Brendan Bernstein\u2019s well written post compares this to the open source Linux community that created massive economic value but had no way to effectively capture it. He argues that developers and applications don\u2019t create value in a native cryptocurrency as the only way that value can accrue is if investors are willing to hold it as sound money.Demand for Smart Contract PlatformsThe growth of the Ethereum ecosystem indicates demand for a smart contract platform that could power new native digital financial assets and protocols. If the demand for smart contract platforms continues to grow, the Ethereum network could potentially support billions or trillions of dollars of economic activity. But if Ether is not held as a store of value and only used as a commodity to pay gas fees, its value may not grow in proportion. As it shifts to proof of stake, this could make Ethereum inexpensive to attack and therefore not secure, limiting its viability for use in many of its potential applications.Most Bitcoin proponents argue that smart contracts are either not viable or should sit on a second layer on top of Bitcoin. However, it\u2019s possible that smart contract functionality on Bitcoin won\u2019t be able to compete with Turing complete smart contract platforms like Ethereum or that it won\u2019t come soon enough. Will developers be willing to wait for this second layer functionality on top of sound money, or will they push ahead and build on available platforms like Ethereum despite the longer term question of native asset value?While the viability of dapps as consumer facing applications is still unclear, there is no question that there is growing adoption of financial infrastructure including tokenized securities, decentralized exchange, lending, prediction markets, and stablecoins.Credit to @set-protocolSo the key question is, could there be a future where Ethereum becomes critical public infrastructure supporting trillions of dollars of economic activity on top of it without its native asset Ether being held as a global monetary store of value?Impact of Tokenized SecuritiesAs a thought experiment, let\u2019s use tokenized securities as an example. Anthony Pompliano and Stephen McKeon have presented strong arguments for the value of issuing equity as blockchain based tokens to create greater efficiency and update the infrastructure to bring trillions of dollars of traditional assets into the digital age. I\u2019ve also argued that while censorship resistance and immutability aren\u2019t necessary for this use case, a global database that isn\u2019t owned by one company in the industry provides a significant benefit.If Ethereum becomes the leading permissionless blockchain and open standard for tokenized securities, this would create demand for Ether to be spent as gas to transfer these assets. However, on chain transactions could be limited as second layer scaling solutions gain traction. One of the common bear arguments is that large financial institutions and companies with traditional cash flow businesses utilizing this technology may view Ether as \u201cworking capital\u201d leading to high velocity that would significantly limit the value that accrues to it. This view would present a strong conflict as it could hurt their core business by reducing the security of the underlying infrastructure that powers the products that generate their profits.Is it possible that the significant potential of Ethereum to create economic value for traditional cash flow businesses could lead to a new thesis where it becomes critical public infrastructure? Could this make it \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d causing value to accrue to Ether as a \u201cstore of national security\u201d that protects a large portion of the new digital economy?A New Target for CyberwarfareGovernments already invest hundreds of billions of dollars in defense budgets to protect their economic interests that directly influence their national security. As cyberwarfare becomes a primary method of conflict into the future, governments will dedicate increasing resources to cybersecurity (both defensive and offensive) to protect their most valuable companies and economic systems from attacks perpetrated by both private and state actors. North Korea\u2019s cyberattack of Sony presents a recent example of this constant threat.As greater amounts of economic value are secured by public blockchains, there will be increased attacks on them that could be disruptive to the economies of countries that rely on them the most. If there is significant value of tokenized securities on top of the Ethereum blockchain, it would be in a government\u2019s interest to protect this value from attacks by hostile actors. When Ethereum shifts to proof of stake, the best way to increase the security of it may be to buy and hold large amounts of Ether to increase the cost required to attack it.If governments, large financial institutions, and cash flow generating companies depend on Ethereum as public infrastructure for their economic stability and profits they could be incentivized to buy and hold Ether not as a monetary store of value but as an investment in their digital security. This value would likely need to accrue in proportion to the growth of economic activity on top of Ether as the level of disruption that an attack would cause would increase providing a greater incentive for hostile actors. Governments, companies, and investors could also speculate on the growth of economic activity on these platforms betting on increased buying of Ether from these large entities to secure this activity providing an additional profit incentive and greater security for the network.The other aspect that makes this interesting is if Ethereum becomes used directly by governments or NGO platforms to power key digital services. There are already trials under way with organizations like the United Nations piloting Ethereum based solutions to distribute aid to families in Pakistan and a Swiss city looking at using Ethereum based Uport for digital identity and voting.Of even greater significance is the remote but real possibility that smaller nations suffering from hyperinflated fiat currencies may see their economies shift to decentralized stablecoins like the Ethereum based Dai. If any of these state backed use cases gain traction, the security of Ethereum as the underlying infrastructure becomes paramount to national security that foreign adversaries would look to disrupt. In this scenario, a collapse could result in a global economic catastrophe. How would central banks respond to future financial crises? Would the major financial institutions that depend on this infrastructure convince central banks that Ethereum is too big to fail?This possible scenario of governments holding Ether also has important implications for Ethereum\u2019s value prop of censorship resistance. While they would want to prevent attacks from hostile actors disrupting economic activity, there\u2019s a huge amount of subjectivity in what is considered an \u201cattack\u201d on the network. Would governments attempt to censor transactions that they consider illegal and risk loss of confidence in the permissionless nature of Ethereum that would lead to hard forks?Rough ModelHere\u2019s some quick back of the napkin math to demonstrate what this thesis might look like with a comparison to traditional defense spending.US GDP: $18.6T (2016)US Defense Department Spending per year: $600B (2016)Percentage of GDP spent on defense: 3%Total US Cybersecurity Spend per Year: $28BYearly Growth Rate of Cybersecurity Spend: 30%Global Equity Market Value: $70T (2016)Potential Percentage of Market Value Spent on Public Infrastructure Defense: 3%Potential Value Held in Ether to Secure it: $2.1TThis comparison uses several big assumptions. First, the assumption that in the long term future (10+ years) there could be tens of trillions of dollars in global value in tokenized securities. This could include global debt, real estate, and new crypto native tokenized cash flows in addition to equities.It also assumes that defense budgets will continue to rapidly evolve from the majority of the spend on manufacturing physical weapons, aircraft carriers, etc. to funding cybersecurity defense. Will this digital defense spend be in similar proportion to the global \u201cdigital GDP\u201d? If so, will it involve purchasing and holding native blockchain assets like Ether. How will the \u201cfree rider\u201d problem play out if companies and governments want to take advantage of this public infrastructure but don\u2019t want to hold value in Ether to secure it? As an aside it\u2019s fascinating to consider national defense budgets used to develop or purchase ASICs to secure Bitcoin as well.ConclusionThe timing that the market converges upon a common view will have an instrumental impact on the potential for Ether to accrue value in the long term. This Ether as a\u201cstore of national security\u201d thesis could benefit from a collective illusion in a similar manner to Bitcoin hodlers spreading the belief that it will become a store of value. The longer that the ecosystem considers the possibility that Ether could accrue value in the long term (under any thesis), the more economic activity is created that depends upon the underlying infrastructure, creating a demand for maintaining security of the Ethereum blockchain.If the market converges in the near future on the belief that Ether will never accrue value, there is a risk that it will prevent developers and companies from building products on top of it that create economic value never giving it a chance to create the demand to be protected.Notably, the potential value held in Ether as a store of national security in the low single digit trillions is still significantly smaller than the addressable market of a global monetary non-sovereign store of value that John Pfeffer estimates at $5T \u2014 $15T.There are undoubtedly significant flaws with this rough model and many \u201cifs\u201d in this thesis that make it improbable. There are still major questions on Ethereum scalability and the ability for the network to be able to effectively scale to meet demand and maintain sufficient decentralization. However, it\u2019s still helpful to consider best case scenarios and alternative addressable market opportunities for Ether without it becoming a monetary store of value. I hope this presents some interesting questions and a different angle to consider in this debate. For example, what percentage of overall economic activity on top of a public blockchain needs to be held in the native asset to secure it? These questions are relevant to Bitcoin as well in a potential future where there are other assets or stablecoins issued on the Bitcoin blockchain.Rather than optimizing for growth of the amount of future computation on Ethereum that drives greater use of Ether for fees, developers may be better served optimizing for use cases with the highest amount of economic value stored as assets on Ethereum, even if they generate less fees. While not as exciting as new decentralized applications, tokenized securities on Ethereum have greater potential to create \u201cskin in the game\u201d for traditional financial institutions and national economies. Ultimately, as the store of value use case is generally seen as a winner take all or at least \u201cwinner take most\u201d, it\u2019s important for Ethereum proponents to consider other paths to significant value accrual that don\u2019t rely on Ether becoming a \u201cbetter money\u201d than Bitcoin.Thanks to Stephen McKeon, Yannick Roux, Sar Haribhakti, and Blake Henderson for providing feedback on this post.For more thoughts and commentary follow me on Twitter", "responses": 6, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Ethereum", "Tokenized Securities", "Bitcoin", "Token Economy"]}, {"title": "Typography in Design Systems", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@ethersystem/typography-in-design-systems-d61bf5d8a333?source=search_post", "author_name": "Ether", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@ethersystem", "publish_date": "2017-12-01", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-20", "readtime": "5.51", "claps": 780, "voters": 138, "content": "Typography in Design SystemsTypography is a core aspect of every design system, but also one of the most fragile and overlooked\u2014here\u2019s how we make sure our typographic systems can stand up to change at scale.EtherFollowDec 1, 2017 \u00b7 6 min readTypography systems are collections of individual styles used across an application. Everyone knows that their system should include typography on some level, but the difficulty is defining that system in a way that is easy to understand by designers and developers, and enforces consistency while allowing for flexibility over time.How do you define a core typographic style?Typography is one of the most basic building blocks of any UI, but also one of the most misunderstood. Without taking careful measures, these systems can be broken from the instant they\u2019re created. In this section we\u2019ll look at how we approach the definition of a system that\u2019s built for change.Understanding How Typography is DefinedDefining typography in a design system can be difficult because of the biases we bring along. In word processors, design programs, and even CSS, we\u2019re used to defining typography holistically, including everything from weight to line-height to color to spacing.HolisticTypography = Family, Size, Line Height, Color, Spacing, etc.Holistic Typography DefinitionThis holistic view of type styling leads to a system that is bogged down with unnecessary stylistic details.To alleviate this over-definition, many frameworks swing the pendulum to the other extreme: an hyper-compartmentalized model of definition like Tachyons or other atomic CSS models. This has its own downfall: it doesn\u2019t produce consistent usage and can leave system users with a paradox of choice.CompartmentalizedTypography = [Family] +[Size] + [Line Height] + [Color] + [Spacing]Compartmentalized Typography DefinitionIf you approach your design system typography using either extreme, it will break down. Handling type in a design system requires a new, nuanced, and correctly compartmentalized way of thinking about how type is styled and defined.Don\u2019t Conflate Style and OutputOne of the earliest warnings we can give anyone building a design system is to never conflate style with output. It is the single fastest way to blow up a typography system.The reality is this: typography styling is, and should be, applied independently of HTML output. Two of the same HTML elements can have totally different styling in different contexts, so those styles need to be abstracted from specific code. Trust us, your developers (and system) will thank you.Coupling the Right CharacteristicsTypography is complex, having multiple characteristics that make up an individual style. But which characteristics make the most sense to couple to a type style? Which ones create the most headaches? We answered that for Ether and our own systems by looking at inherent and contextual characteristics.Inherent Characteristics are ones that are guided by the rules of typography itself. They don\u2019t change based on context, and they include:TypefaceSizeWeightLine-heightLetter-spacingContextual Characteristics can change based on the typography\u2019s uses and goals in the interface. They include:ColorSpacing (padding, margin)Coupling contextual characteristics to typography will do only one thing: exponentially balloon the number of styles in your design system. To keep things manageable we make sure to always define color and spacing separately from type\u2014a lesson we had to learn the hard way.That increased level of complexity can make a system a bear to manage, and even more difficult to implement. By keeping our styles from defining spacing or color, we insulate them from taking on too much weight, and allow our components to do their job\u2014pairing inherent and contextual characteristics based on the contexts they address.In the end we\u2019re left with a system that works like this\u2026HybridTypography = [Style] + [Color] + [Spacing]\u2026with all of those aspects being defined and maintained separately. Each one can change and grow without impacting the others, and each one can stay focused and succinct, keeping our system from growing to the point of failure.How many styles should you define?The complexity and quantity of your typography styles depends largely on the context of your application, but there are some basic ways to work through your needs as you develop a system.How Typography is UsedFirst, you should look at how typography is used across your product and system. For our systems, this has meant defining typography along 4 general purposes\u2014each one with multiple styles:HeadingsBody TextButton TextInput Text (Labels, Fields)Once you understand how your styles are used, you can find overlaps that allow you to minimize the overall number of styles necessary to build your interface effectively. Then you can move on to another typical typographic rat\u2019s nest: sizing.How Typography is SizedProper use of typography requires using it consistently while establishing clear hierarchy. We\u2019ve all seen codebases with 21px, 24px, 28px, and 32px type all separately defined. This haphazard application of hierarchy should be something that a design system guards against, but it can easily become (and erode) the system\u2019s foundation when definitions include similar but slightly-different sizes.To create and enforce this hierarchy we use a sizing scale, defining a base size and a ratio that determines how exponentially sizes increase across styles. This works because as sizes get larger, slight variations become less noticeable\u2014and less useful. Instead, we can eliminate unnecessarily similar sizes and ensure that there\u2019s a broad range of usable sizes in the system.You can actually take our simple generator for a test drive in this handy Codepen example. Instead of using a static size format like pixels or points it uses the little-used ex unit to define size based on the x-height of the typeface itself.Bringing Size and Purpose TogetherUsing both of these concepts we can then construct a system that looks like this, using Ether as an example:Headings (4 sizes)Body Text (3 sizes)Button Text (uses Body)Input Text (uses Body)This method of defining size gets the style count down to 7 core sizes, more than enough to enforce consistency while allowing for flexibility in the design of the UI components.How do you keep typography colors simple?Decoupling color from style is a great place to start, but you still have to attach color somewhere along the way. In building out system components and UIs with larger teams we found that over time designers were using varying, but similar, shades of grey as the product grew, and sometimes text was being specced at colors that failed accessibility standards.Contrast is Your FriendIn order to keep the amount of color choices simple for developers and designers alike, we turned to a foundational design concept: contrast.We wanted to define contrast points that would provide differentiation without overloading the system with options. We also needed to make sure typography could be colored semantically for those specific purposes where a color\u2019s meaning is important. That led us to define a typography-specific color abstraction layer like this:Dark (Full contrast on white)Medium (Mid-level contrast on white)Low (Low-level contrast on white)Light (Mid-level contrast on dark)White (High-level contrast on dark)Semantic (Success, Info, Warning, Danger)Along with the benefit of maintaining consistency and accessibility, these color abstractions have an added benefit: they are change-proof. If the design team decides to change the hex value of green used for semantic success, we can rest assured that change will happen globally in the appropriate contexts only\u2014no find-and-replace necessary.Typography has the ability to make your system a joy to use or an eternal nightmare. Using a couple of these simple tips can go a long way towards helping your system stand the test of time and use.Ether is coming soon.

This article takes a detailed look at three variants and the main differences between them. There will also be suggestions given as to the use of one or another method depending on a specific situation.1. address.send(amount)The first method which was introduced for transferring ether is send(). It has two details that should be considered.First and the most important characteristic is providing 2300 gas limit for execution the fallback function of a contract receiving ether. By the way, this quantity will be sufficient only to create one event.For instance, the code listed below works correctly:contract Sender {  function send(address _receiver) payable {    _receiver.send(msg.value);  }}contract Receiver {  uint public balance = 0;  event Receive(uint value);    function () payable {    Receive(msg.value);  }}The second important aspect that should be paid attention to is as follows: unsuccessful execution of send(), for example out of gas error returns false, but does not throw an exception. Hence, each usage of send() should be inside of require. Otherwise you will pay for gas to proceed a transaction submission in the blockchain, but all the state changes will be undone.For example, it only takes to change a bit the payable function in the Receiver contract:function () payable {  Receive(msg.value);  balance += msg.value;}and your transaction will have a successful receipt, however the status will not change, as an out of gas error has occurred:2. address.transfer(amount)Let us consider a method that appeared in the later versions of solidity. It has two details worth mentioning as well.First, this method has the same 2300 gas limit. However during the development process of these features the developers discussed an opportunity to add .gas() modifier, which redefines the limit of the provided gas.Second, unlike send()method, transfer()throws exception when performed unsuccessfully. Thus, you get to know that your transaction is unsuccessful right at the execution attempt. Ethereum wallet or metamask will notify you about that:3. address.call.value(amount)( )The last and most customized method.The given function still returns false in case an error occurs, that is why keep the usage of require() in mind.Its principal difference from the two previous functions is an opportunity to set gas limit via .gas(gasLimit) modifier. It is necessary in case the payable function of the contract receiving ether performs a complex logic, that requires plenty of gas.Let us take a look at the following example:contract Sender {  function send(address _receiver) payable {    _receiver.call.value(msg.value).gas(20317)();  }}contract Receiver {  uint public balance = 0;    function () payable {    balance += msg.value;  }}Execution of the payable function in the Receiver contract costs more than 20 thousand gas. That is why, usage of send() or transfer() would cause an out of gas error. However thanks to gas() modifier the above-mentioned example works correctly.Please notice that this method is not safe against reentrancy and impact on the contract could be worse than its potential flexibility.

We encourage people to discuss their thoughts, concerns, and solutions about platforms, assets, and technology. With so much global discussion, however, misunderstandings can gain traction in the community.We are writing this piece to address some of the more common misconceptions in the ecosystem that incorrectly describe, understand, or position Ether and Ethereum. In the interest of ensuring conversation about blockchain technology is as truthful as possible and ensuring groups place technical objectivity ahead of financial interest, we have identified and addressed some recurring arguments against Ether and Ethereum. For distinct technical arguments, we have responded as specifically and objectively as possible. For larger theoretical arguments about the direction of Ether and the Ethereum network, we provide our educated thoughts and best judgement.Sections:[1] Regulation Misconception[2] Store of Value Misconception[3] Scalability Misconception[4] Block Size Misconception[5] Security Misconception[6] Centralization Misconception[7] Price Instability Misconception [8] Conclusion[1] Misconception: Pending regulation of token launches will decrease developer activity on the Ethereum blockchain, thus impacting interest and reducing the value of Ether. Ethereum will not be a good platform on which to raise capital due to increased regulation.Globally, token launches, exchange activity, and crypto-investments have decreased in frequency in the wake of regulatory measures or bans on crypto markets, crypto exchanges, and crypto capital. We readily acknowledge that pending regulation \u200bmight\u200b generally decrease the number of token launches that continue to occur (and by extension, occur on Ethereum), but we disagree with the persistent conclusion that such regulation will \u200bnegatively impact the strength of Ether or Ethereum.The fact is, it is the \u200black o\u200bf regulation and compliance clarity that would negatively impact the crypto market down the road\u200b. Without regulatory standards, investors and innovators are reasonably wary about launching, trading, or using tokens. Risk-averse individuals will not invest in a platform or asset without certainty about tax implications, asset classification, and legality. Should the number of tokens on the Ethereum platform decrease in the short term (we still believe Ethereum will remain the most used decentralized application platform and support a greater number of tokens), it will be because regulation has identified and eliminated fraudulent or exploitative tokens and platforms. Regulation not only provides investor confidence through legal clarity, but also by ensuring that future tokens on the Ethereum platform adhere to principles that protect veteran and novice users alike.With clear regulation concerning the crypto market and the resulting increased engagement of developers and investors, we will quickly witness the token liquidity potential of Ethereum. As the most versatile platform in existence, Ethereum will facilitate the tokenization of many of the world\u2019s assets (imagine what \u200bMeridio is doing with real estate\u200b, but applied to an increasing number of assets globally), creating deep liquid markets and revolutionary economic interoperability. This means the cost and latency of economic transactions will be insignificant, the types of assets available to trade will be theoretically limitless, and the access to capital will be democratized as barriers to entry are reduced. \u200bThere is currently no other public blockchain platform with appropriate governance, security, and flexibility to be the substrate of these assets.With regulation comes clarity. With clarity comes developer engagement and investor confidence. With developer engagement and investor confidence comes capital. Ethereum will, therefore, continue to serve as an excellent (in fact, quantifiably the best) blockchain-based platform on which to raise capital. Data illustrating this point further is demonstrated in [2].[2] Misconception: The next bull market in crypto will be dominated by Store of Value (SOV) assets. Ether cannot function as a SOV, therefore other assets such as Bitcoin will lead the next bull run and ETH will suffer.Critics argue that Ether cannot function as a SOV because Ethereum cannot behave successfully as a decentralized application platform or as a capital raising platform. We believe both assumptions to be untrue:Decentralized Application Platform: \u200bEthereum is, without remote consideration, the most robust decentralized application platform in existence. To date, more than 1500 dapps have launched on the platform. Platforms such as FunFair, Augur, Ujo, and Loom Network \u2014 to name a few \u2014 all have functioning, scalable platforms with a robust user base. Technical issues (i.e. scalability) that some argue can detract from application building are addressed in point [3] of this piece. The \u201carchitectural issues\u201d (i.e. centralization) some argue can hurt dapp development are addressed in point [6].Capital Raising Platform: \u200bEthereum is, additionally, without doubt the most successful blockchain-based capital raising platform in existence. \u200bOf the top 100 tokens by market cap\u200b, 94% are built on top of Ethereum. That\u2019s $13 billion in collective capital that has been raised on top of Ethereum to date. \u200bOf the top 700 tokens by market cap\u200b, 87% are built on top of Ethereum. That\u2019s $15 billion out of $19 billion raised among those tokens. We believe the numbers speak for themselves to prove Ethereum\u2019s superiority as a capital raising platform. Related arguments that pending regulation will staunch the flow of capital to the network were addressed in point [1].We, in fact, believe Ether proves itself a strong SOV. For an asset to serve as a robust SOV, it must provide: security, decentralization, network effect, age, liquidity, and utility. In essence, Ether has every quality of security and decentralization that Bitcoin has. Age, liquidity, network effect, and utility are where the platforms differ \u2014 and where Ether(eum) comes out as comparable or on top.Security & Decentralization: \u200bBitcoin and Ethereum were developed with the same commitment to security and decentralization. Both blockchain platforms ensured that, as a founding tenet, participants could use the platforms without fear of losing funds (from flaws in the fundamental technology) or centralized manipulation. Arguments that Ether has been hacked whereas Bitcoin has not are addressed in point [5].Network Effect: \u200bThe strength of a SOV partially lies in its ubiquitous adoption as a SOV. If only a small group of individuals believes something holds value, the loss or change in values of that group will impact the asset\u2019s status as a SOV. We believe Ether has reached a similar level of disparate network effect as Bitcoin to be considered an undeniable SOV from the perspective of ubiquitous adoption and recognition as a valuable asset. In fact, Ether has reached such a degree of decentralization and widespread adoption that \u200bSEC official William Hinman asserted his belief that it is not a security\u200b. Ether and Ethereum, however, have an edge on the crypto market when it comes to the notion of complementary or indirect network effect. Complementary or indirect network effect is the phenomenon whereby the increase in usage of one product increases the value of another, resulting in the increase in value and usage of the original, and so on. As Ethereum-based platforms increase in usage, Ether will experience higher demand, likely leading to an increase in value and drawing more successful projects to the blockchain.Age: \u200bWe openly acknowledge that Bitcoin\u2019s seniority in the blockchain industry endows it with a strong identity as an SOV, but believe Ether\u2019s comparable age (2014) also places it solidly in a position as a SOV.Liquidity: \u200bLiquidity is paramount to an asset\u2019s identity as a SOV. Individuals would not be incentivized to hold an asset they could not easily, quickly, or cheaply trade for money or another asset. Compared to Bitcoin, Ether\u2019s transaction speeds are faster and costs lower. More importantly, we see the future of Ether as vastly more liquid than today \u2014 likely elevating its position as a SOV. In a future where hundreds or thousands of tokens are built off Ethereum (remember, 94% of the top 100 are already built on the platform), we envision deep liquid markets where transactions between Ether and tokens and between tokens and tokens can occur instantaneously, minutely, and cheaply. Ether will become more and more liquid with each additional token built on the platform.Utility: \u200bThe need of a SOV asset to have practical utility is debated \u2014 particularly in the crypto community. The opposing view holds that the amount of innovation, change, and uncertainty that a \u201cuseful\u201d platform undergoes is in direct contradiction to the stability and predictability that people want to see in a SOV. A true SOV, however, must provide some sort of underlying utility to people \u2014 it cannot achieve stability through network effects alone, or so the argument goes. Let\u2019s not forget that gold \u2014 the longest standing, most prevalent SOV in history \u2014 at its core is a \u200bhighly useful e\u200b lement. That said, its market value far outstrips its utility, and its SOV characteristics seem to derive from a combination of utility and market behavior.Ether\u2019s behavior is subject to market pressures like buyers moving fiat into ETH in order to buy tokens, and simultaneously has the utility of providing developers and users with a practical use as gas to fuel the network and engage with dapps. A token economic theory known as the \u201cvelocity thesis\u201d could suggest that tokens developed for a specific use are not likely to gain value as a SOV because their \u201cvelocity\u201d is too high \u2014 i.e. users are unwilling to hold on to them for very long. When Ethereum switches to PoS, however, additional underlying utility will come from staking Ether against pending blocks for financial reward. One likely result is that users will have an incentive to hold Ether more than they previously have in order to reap rewards from staking.In conclusion, two persistent arguments against Ether not serving as a SOV are weak in the face of numbers and network health. Dapp development is strong, scalability issues are being addressed and are live (see [3]), and users are coming to new platforms as they are released. Ethereum is the largest blockchain-based capital raising platform in existence, demonstrated by the billions that have already been raised on the network. The platform will continue to attract capital, and will likely even be helped by regulation that deters weak or predatory token launches and empowers strong ones (see [1]). When we analyze Ether alongside key characteristics of a SOV asset, we find that Ether is more than well-suited to continue serving as a SOV into the future.[3] Misconception: The current scaling shortcomings of Ethereum will drive developers, entrepreneurs, and investors away from the platform. Ether will consequently decrease in value.Scaling is a much-discussed concern in the blockchain ecosystem at large. As a decentralized application hosting a number of consumer-facing products, Ethereum in particular has received attention in the wake of popularly-reported events like CryptoKitties. This concern has long been top of mind for Ethereum developers, and many scaling solutions are already in development or live and in production.Skeptics claim that layer 1 and layer 2 scaling solutions will not be available for a matter of years, or suggest any major developments in scaling will be too late compared to competitors. In reality, we find platforms are already effectively using layer 2 scaling solutions in products that are live today. \u200bLoom Network\u2019s SDK\u200b allows developers to create highly-scalable gaming and social blockchains. They also offer ZombieChain, a layer 2 side chain that uses DPoS as a consensus algorithm while still relying on layer 1 Ethereum as a base security layer. FunFair Technologies\u200b has successfully implemented state channel technology to create highly-scalable, instantaneous, cheap, and user-friendly gaming experiences online. Plasma is in development, and is being applied by projects such as \u200bOmiseGO\u200b. Other scaling solutions in development \u2014 including Casper/PoS, sharding, and Raiden \u2014 are projected for 2018 or early 2019.We would also urge readers to research the reasons why the \u200bEthereum community has chosen to rely on core Ethereum\u200b as a base security layer, while only applying DPoS and other other consensus methods at Layer 2. In fact, we would go so far as to say that it is irresponsible and dangerous to apply these technologies at the base layer. As always, we encourage the community to do its own research. Starting with the Loom and Funfair pieces in the preceding paragraph, however, hopefully the justification for this perspective will come into view. We imagine the wisdom of the market will eventually agree.[4] Misconception: The only scaling solution Ethereum has available to it is increasing block size, which isn\u2019t a viable long-term solution and will lead to worrisome centralization.We do not believe this argument requires a particularly detailed response. \u200bSimply put, increasing block size has never been a sincerely proposed scaling solution by the Ethereum community at large.\u200b Ethereum was created with decentralization and security top of mind, and the centralization implications of increasing block size are antithetical to those core tenets. Rather, the Ethereum community is investing in layer 1 and layer 2 scaling solutions that do not implicate decentralization or security. More detail about scaling solutions is illustrated in [3]. A response to centralization concerns on the Ethereum blockchain is outlined in [6]. Further, the notion that block size would be directly increased (\u200brather than by gas limits\u200b) represents a fundamental misunderstanding of how Ethereum transactions are included in blocks.[5] Misconception: Investors will prefer to invest money in Bitcoin, which has never been hacked, instead of Ether, which has been hacked numerous times.Those who doubt the short and long term market value of Ether maintain that investors will be more willing to store funds on the Bitcoin blockchain rather than the Ethereum blockchain, arguing that Bitcoin has withstood numerous attacks whereas Ether has historically succumbed.Neither Ether nor Ethereum have ever been hacked. We have to assume these arguments refer to events such as multisig parity hack and the DAO hack. Both of those events were security issues with \u200bplatforms \u200bbuilt on top of Ethereum, \u200bakin to a website on the Internet being hacked, not the Internet being hacked.\u200b Neither Ether nor Ethereum themselves were hacked. The weakness in platforms servicing blockchains or built on top of them is not restricted to Ethereum. Bitcoin has had many \u2014 the Mt. Gox exchange \u200bwas hacked\u200b \u200btwice\u200b. The Bitcoin currency itself has, however, been hacked \u2014 unlike Ether. In 2010, \u200bsomeone hacked the Bitcoin blockchain\u200b and created 184 million Bitcoins essentially out of thin air. The blockchain underwent a hard fork to patch the bug that had allowed for the exploit. In summary, the security argument is wrong (or, at best, poorly worded). Both blockchains have had security issues with related exchanges and projects, and both have withstood many attempted attacks on the core technology, but only Bitcoin has revealed a vulnerability in its core code.[6] Misconception: The Ethereum ecosystem is already quite centralized with projects like Infura. Infura \u2014 because it is subsidized and offered for free \u2014 is also artificially keeping transaction costs low.Infura is a \u200bConsenSys\u200b formation providing node access to developers and technologists who cannot or do not want to run a full node themselves. Infura allows these users to \u201coutsource\u201d the computing power of running a node \u2014 essentially acting as a devops provider for the network. Infura is currently serving an estimated \u200b35,000 developers and dapps and is processing 10 billion requests every day\u200b. Infura provides the scalability needed to process \u201cread\u201d transactions, which greatly exceed \u201cwrite\u201d requests.There is, however, nothing inherently centralizing about the existence of Infura on the infrastructure layer. There is nothing stopping other devops providers from entering the market \u2014 there just doesn\u2019t exist the market pressure for those competitors to enter the market yet. The concept of forming a devops service to provide more nodes to handle scale is not a novel concept \u2014 Infura just happens to be the most prominent player in the market. If Infura does eventually pose a centralization risk, that would serve as sufficient market pressure to allow more players into the industry.Concerns have also emerged that Infura \u2014 as it is subsidized by ConsenSys \u2014 is artificially suppressing the real cost of transacting on the Ethereum blockchain. We have seen an (un-sourced) estimation that Infura takes >$10 million a year to operate. While we will elect not to divulge specifics of Infura\u2019s business at present, let\u2019s investigate what it would look like \u200bif we took\u200b this $10 million/year estimate at face value. That is about $830,000/month to operate. Spread out among 35,000 customers (cited above), that is a monthly fee of $23.80 per customer \u2014 hardly a significant cost for a B2B service and insignificant as far as its impact on gas cost.Given this analysis, and the fact that even subtle market demand for Ethereum applications could support a $23.80/month per company burn rate, we believe this to be a non-argument.[7] Misconception: The volatility of Ether\u2019s price demonstrates it is an unstable asset to invest in compared Bitcoin.The blockchain ecosystem has compared Ether\u2019s ~1,700x return in its first four years (July 2014 crowdsale \u2014 July 2018) to Bitcoin\u2019s 10x return in the same time frame. This argument follows that 1,700x compared to 10x demonstrates Ether\u2019s instability, making it a dangerous investment and prime to deflate in value. However, if we compare \u200brelative time frames, \u200bwe find Ether\u2019s 1,700x return rate in its first four years of existence barely approaches Bitcoin\u2019s. Between one of Bitcoin\u2019s earliest reported valuations on July 17, 2010 (Yahoo Finance, ~$0.05/BTC) and July 17, 2014 (~623/BTC), it had a return rate of 12,500x. \u200bIn fact, if we analyze the return rate from the earliest monetary exchange of Bitcoin on May 22, 2010 (\u200b$25 worth of pizza for 10,000 BTC\u200b = $0.0025/BTC) to the value on May 22, 2014 (~$526/BTC), the return rate is over 210,000x.\u200b The argument that Ether\u2019s 1,700x return rate in its first four years indicates a crypto asset that is too volatile to invest in long-term does not quite hold water when compared to Bitcoin\u2019s extreme return rate in its first four years.[8] ConclusionWe hope this publication has helped clarify arguments in the blockchain ecosystem that incorrectly depict the utility, strength, and future of Ether and Ethereum. Broadly speaking, many misconceptions seem to stem from the belief that room for success in the market is limited; that one blockchain or asset must come out on top and another must consequently suffer. Instead, we maintain the \u201cpie is big enough\u201d and will keep growing, allowing legacy blockchains and crypto markets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum to continue to grow while providing room for other platforms and assets to enter the market. We have, we do, and we will always acknowledge the growth and improvement the Ethereum network needs. We have, we do, and will, however, always remain confident in the countless members of the Ethereum community working on developing and integrating the platform.

But if you come to think of it, in the traditional financial systems the value transfer is not truly digital.The digital money that banks are displaying is not truly transferring value in a digital way. It\u2019s just a display of numbers with no sophisticated transfer of value behind it. No hard currency is transferred from one bank to the other the moment you make a wire transfer (and that\u2019s why it\u2019s efficient). It\u2019s just a display that we blindly trust that it\u2019s true. Let\u2019s call it a display currency.Why is this the case? Let\u2019s dive a bit deeperIf you look at the traditional financial infrastructure, there are always five components in place:custody is one organizationissuance is another one (central bank)payment systems a separate oneaudit at another placethe state providing the governance.In almost every transaction, all of the above components have a role in order for the system to function efficiently.If you look at bitcoin, we have all the components of the above-mentioned fiat system, but all managed by the same piece of code. Bitcoin network provides the payment system, the issuance, the audit, the governance, the custody, all in one network.So what did bitcoin truly achieve?What bitcoin achieved was a real transfer of value; the truly transition from the paper to the digital era. The moment you transfer a bitcoin to someone, you instantly transfer the actual asset. This happens without involving any trusted 3rd party. Just using math.It\u2019s a hard concept to understand since the line is thin, but if you do, you will see that the bitcoin network achieved a disruption on the traditional financial infrastructure play.But what is all that noise?The last few years we\u2019ve seen a plethora of teams trying to repeat the genius infrastructure of bitcoin.Teams are introducing new coins, promising innovations. But what kind of disruptions these truly are?The differences between all these coins and services are nothing more but new infrastructure plays as we transition from the paper to the digital era.What kind of infrastructure?As we mentioned above, a payment system to function in a secure way it needs a few processes in it:Governance,Custody,Issuance and distribution,Transaction processing,AuditBefore bitcoin all the above where separate entities and fully centralized.But it doesn\u2019t need all 5 to be decentralized in order to create a digital asset. For example, there might be a digital asset without auditing at all because some people would like to keep their transaction history completely private from the public or any central authority.So, today the 3 states of the above 5 processes can be:CentralizedDecentralizedNoneFor example, the Central Bank network has all the above 5 processes fully centralized and this is why you receive a central bank currency (display currency).Bitcoin is a fully decentralized network and this is why the digital asset that you receive is fully decentralized as well (cryptocurrency).ZCash and Monero are decentralized networks but auditing is not possible since you can\u2019t see the history of transactions (still a cryptocurrency).Ripple has centralized governance and issuance (the team does both of them) but all other processes are decentralized (not a cryptocurrency since it\u2019s centralized but it\u2019s auditable digital currency).Tether, or now Gemini dollar, are backed by the USD, centralized since under control of a certain organization (not cryptocurrencies, just new form of digital assets).There is one more obstacle we have to overcomeInterconnectivity of the mentioned systems above.For example, right now, if you want to open a website, you can do it from any browser, any device. But if you want to manage your fiat assets you cannot use Wells Fargo unless you open an account there, you can\u2019t transfer money to another country unless Swift gets involved. Same goes for the crypto space. If you have 10 different currencies and you want to transfer value from one asset to another, you will need to use a third party service (like an exchange or atomic swaps) that will allow you to do this.In the current state, we can describe it as having to use different browsers for different websites.At the end, we will have a universal infrastructure, a financial internet where all assets will \u201ctalk\u201d to each other.Ok, but why do they need a blockchain?As mentioned above, all the above assets are becoming digital assets and will be basically defined by the infrastructure (payment system) in which they \u2018exist\u2019.Why? Because the basic feature that accounting system needs in order to be reliable is security. And blockchain provides the security features. It\u2019s a mechanism for reaching consensus between multiple parties who don\u2019t trust each other. In other words, the blockhain digitalizes the trust and the memory factor. All you need in order to transfer value.So, blockchain is not about currency, but rather about consensus regarding the state of some digital asset. In order to achieve consensus, you need participation. In order to incentivize people to participate in such a network, you reward them with a currency. It can be a new coin built from scratch that it\u2019s only used for this network or an existing one.We should never forget that blockchain is just a tool for a system, like a camera for a photo, a hammer for a nail, or an engine for a car.The creation of new digital assetsIf you think about it, these are assets that we never had imagined before the digital era. Thanks to digitalization we now have the flexibility to practically create assets that never existed before. And this happened by introducing two more states, decentralized and none (for now, maybe more in the future).As a conclusion, there are three major types of digital assets:Display assets. Everything is fully centralized and there is no sophisticated transfer of value. It\u2019s just a display and we just trust the banks that the numbers that we see represent the truth.Cryptocurrencies. The ultimate level of decentralization on the infrastructure level. The trust factor is ultimately eliminated. There is no part that is centralized.Hybrid digital assets. Some parts of the infrastructure are centralized, while others are decentralized or they don\u2019t exist.Digital assets are different to the tokenization of analog assets.Don\u2019t confuse the tokenization of analog assets with digital assets. These are two completely different things.The former is when we take an analog asset such as real estate and we use blockchain in order to automate the ownership rights. Instead of using lawyers, we turn the analog asset and its ownerships rights into a package that we call it a token. The house didn\u2019t turn digital, it\u2019s still a house. We just automated the ownership infustructure using the technology of blockchain.The latter, transformed completely the asset into a digital form. For example, bitcoin didn\u2019t turn dollar (analog asset) into a token. Bitcoin is a stand alone digital money by itself. It made the analog asset obsolete.ConclusionAs we can see above, digital assets acquire specific features depending on the context.Currently, we make analogies with the assets that we understand and we know, \u201cbitcoin is the new gold\u201d, \u201cether is the new dollar\u201d but what we actually build it\u2019s something way bigger.We gradually transit from the paper to the digital era structuring a universal infrastructure, a trust-less network where all assets will \u201ctalk\u201d to each other and people will use them freely according to their needs.Eventually, we will not even realize which asset we use each time. The same way we don\u2019t really know which protocol we use every time we open a new website. Can you imagine how far this can go?We are lucky to be in the beginning of this era.Follow my updates on twitter @katerinastro.", "responses": 4, "tags": ["Bitcoin", "Digital Assets", "Digital Era", "Ether", "Cryptocurrency Era"]}, {"title": "Ethereum, Ether And The Blockchain Ecosystem !", "post_link": "https://codeburst.io/ethereum-blockchain-primer-for-all-50c3f5f42d49?source=search_post", "author_name": "Pramod Chandrayan", "author_link": "https://codeburst.io/@pramod.pandey83", "publish_date": "2018-02-23", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-20", "readtime": "8.47", "claps": 668, "voters": 95, "content": "Ethereum, Ether And The Blockchain Ecosystem !Pramod ChandrayanFollowFeb 23, 2018 \u00b7 9 min readsource: ethereum.orgI Feel:Blockchain is a new way of digital communication and transaction where everyone is powerful, and accountable, thus giving birth to the powerful democratic ecosystem for humans to thrive. This NoTrust System is really trustworthy and a new decentralized internet for the masses to go mainstream.A group of people known by pseudonym Satoshi Nakamato gave this world a truly game changing technology, which now the world knows by the name The Blockchain : A chain of decentralized public ledger or database blocks.As per Investopedia:A Blockchain is a digitized, decentralized, public ledger of all cryptocurrency transactions. Constantly growing as \u2018completed\u2019 blocks (the most recent transactions) are recorded and added to it in chronological order, it allows market participants to keep track of digital currency transactions without central recordkeeping. Each node (a computer connected to the network) gets a copy of the blockchain, which is downloaded automatically.Don & Alex Tapscott, authors Blockchain Revolution (2016) says:\u201cThe blockchain is an incorruptible digital ledger of economic transactions that can be programmed to record not just financial transactions but virtually everything of value.\u201dThis brilliant innovation has powered many blockchain system like bitcoin, litecoin, NEO, Ripple and many more digital currency. Today we will cover in detail about Ethreuem : A Comprehensive Blockhain Ecosystem which is empowering many blokchain powered innovative idea to capture the imagination of ingenious minds and the world as a whole.We will uncover our journey in the following phases:What Is Ethereum After All ?What Is Ether?How Ethereum Works?Comparison Between Bitcoin & Ethereum.How To Invest in Ethereum & Market Stats?Infographics To Sum It All.What Is Ethereum?ethereum.org defines It :As an open blockchain platform that lets anyone build and use decentralized applications that run on blockchain technology. Like Bitcoin, no one controls or owns Ethereum \u2014 it is an open-source project built by many people around the world. But unlike the Bitcoin protocol, Ethereum was designed to be adaptable and flexible. It is easy to create new applications on the Ethereum platform, and with the Homestead release, it is now safe for anyone to use those applications.Young ingenious fellow Vitalik Buterin proposed in 2013 that a single blockchain with the capability to be reprogrammed to perform any arbitrarily complex computation could subsume these many other eventually in 2014 he together with his partners began to work, with a vision to implement a general, fully trustless smart contract platform which you now know as Ethereum, The system went live on 30 July 2015, with 11.9 million coins \u201cpremined\u201d for the crowdsale.As per wiki: In 2016, as a result of the collapse of The DAO project, Ethereum was split into two separate blockchains \u2014 the new separate version became Ethereum (ETH), and the original continued as Ethereum Classic (ETC).The value of the Ethereum currency grew over 13,000 percent in 2017.EVM: Ethereum Virtual Machine:EVM is at the heart of Ethereum\u2019s decentralized platform which can execute code of arbitrary algorithmic complexity. In computer science terminology, It is Called Turing complete. Techies can develop their own Dapp\u2019s that gets executed on the Ethereum\u2019s EVM using the language like JS, Python etc. Developers can create applications that run on the EVM using friendly programming languages modelled on existing languages like JavaScript and Python.Similar to other blockhain ethereum works on P2P Network Protocols where each blockchain database is maintained and managed by multiple nodes each connected to the P2P network. Each node running their own EVM executes the same instructions, That\u2019s why Ethereum is sometimes described evocatively as a \u201cworld computer\u201d.The ethereum nodes runs the EVM to build a decentralized consensus across the Blockchain network making Ethereum NetworkFault ResistantEnsuring Zero DowntimeMaking data stored in each block, unchangeable and censorship-resistant forever2. Ether : Ethreum\u2019s Own CryptoCurrencyEthereum has its own cryptocurrency named Ether which they also call asThe crypto-fuel for the Ethereum networkIf any client executes any transaction on ethereum P2P network he pays in the form Ether to fuel the trasaction. Ether is also an incentive for encouraging developer to write a high quality dapp\u2019s to minimize the cost which goes into writing a crappy code, it inspires the developers to maintain the coding standards apt for building a healthy ethereum ecosystem.How Are Ethers Created?Ether went into a presale offer where(data sourced from: https://www.ethereum.org/ether )60 million ether created to contributors of the presale12 Million (20% of the above) were created to the development fund, most of it going to early contributors and developers and the remaining to the Ethereum Foundation5 ethers are created every block (roughly 15 seconds) to the miner of the block2\u20133 ethers are sometimes sent to another miner if they were also able to find a solution but his block wasn\u2019t included (called uncle/aunt reward)Note: That after the Byzantium update is implemented, the mining and uncle reward is reduced to 3 ethers and 0.625\u20132.625 ethers, respectively.As per agreement by the platform stakeholders the max supply of ether has been restricted to : 18 million ether per year (this number equals 25% of the initial supply). This means that while the absolute issuance is fixed, the relative inflation is decreased every year. The rate is going to change in 2018\u201319, as the new platform is under development named Casper where ethereum is expected to change from proof of work. Casper is expected to be more efficient and require less mining subsidy.3. How Ethereum Functions?Ethereum while handling any transaction make use of the basic unit called \u201cAccounts\u201d. The state of each account in a blockchain is maintained together with the state, of amount being transferred and information of the accounts involved in transaction.There are two types of accounts:EOA\u2019s : Externally Owned Accounts controlled privately through Private KeysContract Accounts: which are controlled by their contract code and can only be \u201cactivated\u201d by an EOABitcoin Account Vs Ethereum Accounts:Transaction Fee:User who wants to transact over ethereum\u2019s network has to pay a small transaction fee, this has been done deliberately to maintain the platform decorum and protect it from frivolous or malicious computational tasks, like DDoS attacks or infinite loops. The sender of a transaction must pay for each step of the task they initiated, including computation and memory storage. These fees are paid in amounts of Ethereum\u2019s native value-token, ether.Miner\u2019s : Rewards & BenefitsThe transaction fees are collected by network nodes which act as miners in the Ethereum Network.These miners receive, propagate, verify, and execute transactions. The miners then group the transactions \u2014 which include many updates to the \u201cstate\u201d of accounts in the Ethereum blockchain \u2014 into what are called \u201cblocks\u201d, and miners then compete with one another for their block to be the next one to be added to the blockchain.You must be thinking what is the reward for Miners to verify and validate the account owners, well they get Ethers for every successful mining of blocks which kind of, is an incentive for miners to invest their resources to power the Ethereums huge electricity needs.How Miners Mines ?Like Bitcoin network here also miners performs complex mathematical problems to be solved where they parse through all the chain of blocks to verify them as a Proof Of Work, Any computational problem that requires orders of magnitude more resources to solve algorithmically than it takes to verify the solution is a good candidate for proof of work. Once the block is verified it gets added into the Ethreum\u2019s blockchain network.4.

How To Invest In Ethereum?Now when you know that ethereum has the potential worth to challenge the oldest cryptocurrency \u201cBitcon\u201d you must be wondering how to invest in it ? Ether is a currency of Ethereum ecosystem which you as a investor will be trading as token, in exchange of your dollar or legal tender. So what is the process of buying it?Buying Ether :To buy an ether from the crypto exchanges you first need to have a secure digital wallet, Ethereum doesn\u2019t trade on any major stock platform. You can\u2019t go to your online discount broker and buy Ethereum. You have to convert it into your wallet.It is recommended to try : Try Coinbase where you can sign up following this link and buy Ethereum , bitcoin and other currency to also store it in their secure wallet. It is also recommended that you after buying the Ether, store it in separate multi-currency offline/ hardware wallet to be extra protected against any miss-happening, I will be covering a few of those below later.Here i am listing below,few other popular exchanges to trade Ether and other cryptocurrency:sourceMulticurrency Wallets : To Store Ether & Other Crypto\u2019s1. Exodus:Exodus is a relatively new and unknown digital wallet that is currently only available on the desktop. It enables the storage and trading of Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoins, Dogecoins and Dash through an incredibly easy to use, intuitive and beautiful interface2. Jaxx:Jaxx is a multi-currency Ether, Ether Classic, Dash, DAO, Litecoin, REP, Zcash, Rootstock, Bitcoin wallet and user interface. Jaxx has been designed to deliver a smooth Bitcoin and Ethereum experience. It is available on a variety of platforms and devices (Windows, Linux, Chrome, Firefox, OSX, Android mobile & tablet, iOS mobile & tablet) and connects with websites through Firefox and Chrome extensions.3. Ledger NanoThe Ledger Wallet Nano is a new hierarchical deterministic multi-signature hardware wallet for users who are looking to store their currency and protect it from being hacked. In terms of hardware, the Ledger Wallet Nano is a compact USB device based on a smart card. It is roughly the size of a small flash drive, measuring 39 x 13 x 4mm (1.53 x 0.51 x 0.16in) and weighing in at just 5.9g.Pros:Screen/device protected by metal swivel coverMulti-Currency support3rd-Party apps can run from deviceU2F supportWhen recovering wallet from seed, the whole process can be done from the device without even connecting it to a computer!Fairly inexpensive (~$65 USD)Cons:Not as advanced wallet software (no transaction labeling)No ability to create hidden accountsNo password managerWell there are many more offline soft & hardware wallets which we will take separately in our next in the series of Cryptos\u2026Ethereum Market Stats As On 23 Feb 2018( Source)Market Cap : $86,677,421,336 USD Volume (24h): $2,380,350,000 USD Circulating Supply : 97,794,946 ETHsource6.

Are they going to spend a week painstakingly signing 11,440 individual transactions? Are they going to send the whole amount to an account controlled by a single individual so they can make the payments? As it happens, neither: thanks to a brilliant suggestion by Vitalik, it\u2019s possible to make all the transfers trustlessly, in a manner that requires only a single transfer by the trustees. Read on to find out how.Transaction Signing in EthereumEveryone knows that to create a valid Ethereum transaction, you first have to sign it using your private key, and that only signed transactions are valid. That\u2019s true, but it\u2019s not quite the whole truth.The process by which signatures are validated in Ethereum is called \u2018ecrecover\u2019. This is a function that takes a message and its signature, and returns the public key (and hence the address) that signed it. In Ethereum, the \u2018from\u2019 address of a transaction isn\u2019t explicitly included in a transaction; instead, ecrecover is called, and the address it returns is the from address of the transaction. Since only the owner of that address\u2019s private key can generate signatures that return that address, only they can authorize the network to spend funds from their account.What if we ignored the usual signing process, though, and just filled in whatever we liked for the transaction signature? It turns out that half of all signatures are valid in the sense that ecrecover returns a public key (and thus an address). Since we have no control over what address that is, what we\u2019ve just done is to build a transaction that can spend funds from a seemingly random address. If we create such a transaction, then fund the generated address with some Ether, the transaction will be able to execute just like a regular one. We\u2019ve effectively created a \u201csingle use address\u201d, where funds can only be spent by one transaction. If we publish the transaction, and choose values for the signature field in some predictable fashion, we can prove to anyone that funds sent to that address will be usable only by that transaction, and nothing else.Multisends with one-time addressesThe extraBalance multisend is being handled in just such a fashion. First, we generate a series of transactions that send ether to multiple addresses \u2014 110 of them per transaction \u2014 and generate addresses for them using the process described above. For the signature fields, we fill in \u20180xDA0DA0DA0\u2026\u2019 \u2014 a predictable value so that you can be certain someone doesn\u2019t actually have a private key for the generated address.This produces a series of transactions with \u2018one time addresses\u2019 that can be used to fund them. 104 transactions is still a few too many for the trustees to easily sign, so we repeat the process one more time, building another transaction that sends ether to the 104 transactions we generated in the first step, producing a single transaction with its own unique address.Now, anyone can verify the transactions to satisfy themselves that they send the correct amount of ether to the correct address list, and once satisfied, the trustees can authorize a payment to the root transaction\u2019s address. After that, anyone can submit the transactions to the network, starting the whole process that will result in sending ether to everyone on the list \u2014 all with only a single signature required, and without needing to trust an individual with the funds.", "responses": 8, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Ethereum", "Ecdsa"]}, {"title": "Writing in the Ether", "post_link": "https://writingcooperative.com/writing-in-the-ether-6c2147deba15?source=search_post", "author_name": "Lisa Renee", "author_link": "https://writingcooperative.com/@zabado11", "publish_date": "2017-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-07", "readtime": "3.90", "claps": 572, "voters": 89, "content": "Photo by Yuriy Bogdanov | UnsplashWriting in the EtherMy Two CentsLisa ReneeFollowNov 10, 2017 \u00b7 4 min readI published my first post here three years ago, so celebration is in order, yes? The world is particularly rotten these days, in so very many ways; any excuse for a toast is welcome. I\u2019ll have an Aperol Spritz, please. The summery vibe conflicts with the wool and the wood stove, but I\u2019m aiming for an alternative universe. Whatever it takes.I\u2019ve been here, writing in the digital ether, for long enough to have learned a few things. I\u2019ve written a lot and, hopefully, improved. I\u2019ve learned to build and edit. I\u2019ve suffered the indifference of readers and basked in the glow of their attention. I\u2019ve made some friends and had some splendid conversations. All from the bed, the backyard, from breakfast and the beach.It\u2019s been like a writers\u2019 conference that goes on forever and is loads of fun, but you don\u2019t have to go anywhere and you can be naked or wrapped in a psychedelic muumuu. You can even have an Aperol Spritz in your footie jammies and nobody cares. Because nobody knows (unless you tell them, of course). And you can publish five things in a week and then nothing for a month and it\u2019s all good. There\u2019s no attendance or expectation \u2014 you can just work in the corner of your choice and nice people will stop in and say hi, or you can run around and visit other people in their corners and smile at them and everything is fine. And sometimes there\u2019s a party.Something like that.Anyway, my two cents. If I had known then what I know now.Don\u2019t compare yourself to anyone.I do it all the time and sink into a sad little funk about the amazing writing out there and what the hell am I doing? But I\u2019ve learned from experience that if I shut up, put my head down, and write something with attention \u2014 anything \u2014 someone usually, eventually, notices and says a nice thing. And the pieces that I thought were probably crap \u2014 tossed-off nothings cast to the wind with casual whatevers \u2014 those pieces are often the most popular. Go figure. \u201cComparison is the thief of joy.\u201d Teddy Roosevelt supposedly said that and, boy was he right.Forget the stats.They are poison. I know, I imbibe regularly \u2014 but I always regret it. Just put your head down and write something. Don\u2019t look at any algorithm-related thing that someone has built so that you can turn your writing into a sport. The pieces that I love the most are often flapping in the breeze with very little love, so the masses sometimes just won\u2019t get it. It doesn\u2019t matter. Just keep writing.Never mind genre.I\u2019ve written about disparate subjects in many different voices \u2014 I\u2019m just trying stuff on. That essay that\u2019s going nowhere? Clip the best lines and paste them into a poem. Or smash the verses of that stalled poem into a paragraph and see if it\u2019s got legs as a story. Sometimes a story is actually two stories \u2014 or three. Let the work tell you what it wants to be. It\u2019s fun, like a puzzle, and you never know what may blossom from the muck.Submit and forget.This one is hard to do and can be very frustrating. The world of publishing often wants to think about your work for a very long time before responding. I\u2019ve waited months for crickets or no thanks and it\u2019s tough to feel ignored or discarded after you\u2019ve bled on the page. It\u2019s good advice, though. If you can wing the best away to your dream publications and start work on the next masterpiece, the worst thing you\u2019ll end up with is a lot of work. And, one day, you\u2019ll end up with a byline that makes you blush (and maybe even some cash). You can, of course, stick with the instant gratification of ether posting \u2014 that road is balm to a love-starved soul and, if you look up \u201cwriter\u201d in the dictionary, I\u2019m pretty sure it says \u201clove-starved soul.\u201dLive.Don\u2019t forget this part. I actually made a note to myself, recently \u2014 Don\u2019t forget to live. It seems crazy, I\u2019m a little ashamed to admit it, but sometimes I fall into a writing hole and can\u2019t find my way into the writing or out of the hole. It\u2019s dawned on me that the only way around it is to get up and live. Do something that is distinctly not writing. Take a walk, make a cake, clean the fridge, visit a friend. Build, break, dance, rave. Ride a horse or a bike or a dolphin. Take care of that thing you\u2019ve been ignoring. Anything. Breathe some of the world into yourself so that you can take it back to your writing. It works like magic.Just write.After the don\u2019t forget to live bit, that\u2019s the best advice I have. Everyone says it, Nike built a whole ad campaign around the concept, but it\u2019s a quality bottom line. Just do it. And do it again. And again. You\u2019re probably at least as good as many of the other souls scribbling away (and better than some), so just write. The only thing that has given me the confidence that I lacked for so long was to just do it. It\u2019s also the only thing that has made me better.Just write. Look out the window, or at the wall. Fish the next word from the sea in your skull and write it down. Repeat.Cheers!Lisa Renee is a poet and essayist, living near a big lake in New York.

Now I want to explore another idea that emerged from the last two ones on how to prevent a chain split. Here are my starting premises:Community splits are bad and should be avoidedIf a major client gives users the option to fork, then the end result will not be a popular vote but a splitOn the other hand, shutting the door on an influential party that is requesting a fork might just force them to a forkIncentives for Parity splitting: new etherIt\u2019s a simple calculation really: let\u2019s suppose the overall ethereum community decides not move forward with EIP999, but Parity implements it anyway on their very popular client. The probable result is that there will be a new blockchain, let\u2019s call it Ethereum-999 (should we call it the under-millennial?), where over 500,000 ether that were previously stuck on Multisig contracts can now be accessed. How much will ether-999 be sold for? Cryptocurrencies are volatile and hard to price using traditional means so here I\u2019ll use a simple model: the price of a fork is the likelyhood of that fork overtaking the original chain. Using that logic, at the moment of this writing, the market evaluates Bitcoin Cash having a 15% chance of overtaking bitcoin, Ethereum Classic having 3% chance of overtaking the main Ethereum chain and Bitcoin Gold (lol) having 0.9% chance of being taken seriously by anyone.It\u2019s hard to know what the market will bet on ether-999 but if Parity puts their development force behind it (even more in the unlikely event that they stop supporting the main chain) then it will be larger than 0, which is what they get for not splitting. A small percentage of access to $250 million dollars is still a lot of money.Incentives for not splitting: new tokenAn obvious solution then would be to create a new token, called ether-recovery, and distribute it to all the parties affected by the multisig hack (and other categories of stuck ether). If the potential value of that new ether is larger than the potential value of a split (minus any losses associated with initiating a split) then a fork can be avoided. But what would give value to the new token?Futures market for recoveryLet\u2019s assume we create tokens for all classes of lost and stuck ether. Before tokens can be created these conditions would need to apply:It\u2019s not a recurring event: prevention is always better than recovery, so before a new token class is created it should be show that steps have been taken, either on protocol or in the UX of clients, to avoid these mistakes from happening in the future, as well as showing that if such events are still happening, they are in a much smaller scale.Ether is provably not in circulation: having your ether stolen by a third party or claiming you lost the hard drive in the trash would not apply, ether needs to be provably lost forever.Ownership can be cryptographically verified in an automated way: it should be possible to run a script and verify which key or keys had access to that ether. So while each token class is dealt in a case by case scenario, who gets assigned tokens in each case can be determined automatically without resorting to lawyers and judges.After a token class is created, and the lost ether is assigned on a 1:1 basis, then the new token is set to be the children of a recovery contract that will hold any funds gathered towards that recovery. The contract keeps track of its own total ether balance and the sum of the supply of all tokens that are underneath it. Token holders can decide at any point \u201cwithdraw\u201d from the account, at which point the following things happen:Upon withdrawal, you get sent ether equivalent to the (amount of tokens you own) * (total balance of recovery account) / (total supply of recovery tokens). Meaning that if you own 0.01% of the recovery tokens, you get 0.01% of all ether on that accountThe token is burnt and you are therefore forfeiting all future claims on recovery. Each new withdrawal therefore increases the portion of the pie of the current holders in any future recovery process.If any fork is attempted that tries to remedy the given class of lost ether, then that token is immediately disconnected from the main contract, even if the fork fails to have meaningful traction (with some checks and balances to prevent low-effort forks just to disconnect tokens).Source of recovery fundsWhen receiveing a recovery token, all owners are implicitly accepting a social contract in which all recovery efforts will help fund the main contract. These can be many:Donations: this might be a hard sell as many of the affected parties are not people in humanitarian crisis, but often corporations or people are otherwise in a comfortable situation. But given that not forking is a benefit for all, some people or institutions might make a gesture of good will to try to avoid the splitEIP1015: when ethereum changes from PoW to PoS, the block reward can be significantly reduced to reflect the lower cost of Casper security. Instead of throwing the difference away this EIP proposes a platform to decide, via a smart contract, worthy recipients of the block reward to various uses. If the community votes so, then funding recovery could be one of them.Services: a large amount of the funds gathered in the multisig where ICOs, for Musiconomy and Polkadot, for instance. Donating to the recovery fund could in itself create a new token that affected parties could provide some service to.Future Insurance of Contracts: we will explore this in the next sectionAn important aspect is that all these options don\u2019t need to happen in order for the token to have value: the value of the recovery token will reflect the chances that any of these will work at any point in the future. For example, in order to have a portion of the block rewards to be used towards recovery, these actions would all need to happen: Casper becomes ready for deployment, EIP1015 is approved and implemented AND enough signalling contracts vote for this particular use of rewards (and still, it can be a small amount or not last for very long).A recovery token is unlikely ever to reach a 1 ether parity, but that doesn\u2019t matter: as long as the recovery token is worth potentially more than a possible minority split, then the rational economic choice of all affected actors will be not to fork. And since both can be seen as indicators of chance, the market will be comparing the chance of a minority fork overtaking the main chain, versus the chance of a total recovery of funds via the token.Future Insurance on contractsYou might be unconvinced that donations would compensate for the immense losses or doubt the viability of implementing other recovery options using future hard forks that are less controversial. You might even be in the camp that people should have to pay for their own mistakes (or mistakes from entities they trusted) and that we should focus on the future. This section is for you.This recovery contract is meant for ether that has already been lost, but what about future lost tokens? If they are added to the recovery token side, they risk just further dilluting an already very poor pie and could be another governance nightmare. Unless we turn this on a potential profitable venture: staking ether as insurance.In order to create a new class of possible recoverable tokens these would be the steps:Describe exactly what class of contract or application would be covered by the tokenLock up ether for a predetermined period of yearsOne recover-ether is issued for each ether locked up (independently on how many ethers are on the affected contracts)The issuer can then sell their recovery-ether for their clients, ICO participants, users or whoever he wants to use the guaranteeIf the ether in the described scenario happens, then the recovery process is activated and the ether is redeemed at 90% rate (the remainder 10% goes to the general insurance fund of all tokens and the victim gets an equivalent amount of new recover token)If nothing happens after the given amount of years, then the recover-ether tokens are destroyed and the issuer can have their locked ether back (and keep the profits of the sale)If the clients want a continuing insurance after the years passed, then they can go back to step 1Governance decisions, like which token to accept or not, as well as judging decisions on either a given scenario fits the description of \u201clost\u201d ether, will all be done via some sort of delegated vote by all the holders of current recover-ether. This aligns the interests of all the potential victims of loss with the profit of the fund as a whole: if the fund stops accepting new applicants or refusing to help an insured party when it needs, then it will affect negatively the future profit of the funds and therefore affect the chances of all parties to be fully restored.This scheme basically transforms the previous \u201cvictims\u201d of lost ether into \u201cshareholders\u201d of a general smart contract insurance fund. But why would someone want to start an insurance fund with over 500 thousand ether in \u201cliabilities\u201d instead of doing just a \u201ctraditional\u201d ICO? Because the affected parties of those contracts (which goes beyond the parity multisig and a lot of early users of ethereum) comprises of many of the most technically capable developers (including one of the ethereum founders) and a diverse set of early ethereum users, a captive audience that would help create a network effect that many other new startups would kill (or better airdrop) for. And if the insurance system is seen as having great future potential, it becomes possible that a recover ether to be traded at higher than 1 ether.In one action we could:Give people who participated in this experiment of keeping billions of dollars in beta software a way to recover value lost in errors that often were not their own faultAvoid creating a controversial hard fork that can ultimately lead to a split community and a lot of crazy effects on the current running projects.Start an insurance fund that allows future contracts also to be safeguarded against eventual failuresProfit while doing good", "responses": 10, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Ethereum", "Eip999", "Parity"]}, {"title": "Why Ethereum is Not a Security", "post_link": "https://medium.com/futuresin/why-ethereum-is-not-a-security-125712c16adf?source=search_post", "author_name": "Michael K.

The commission will decide whether it qualifies as a security.This has important repercussions on the future of smart-contract platforms for which Ethereum is the first-mover.On ICOs some of thoes testifying said:\u201cWe owe it to this new generation to respect their enthusiasm about virtual currencies with a thoughtful and balanced response, not a dismissive one,\u201d said Giancarlo, \u201cand yet we must crack down hard on those who try to abuse their enthusiasm with fraud and manipulation.CoingapeIs Ethereum a security or not? The SEC and the CFTC are trying to figure it outThe consensus seems to be Ethereum is not a security. Ethereum (ETH), the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, so the label it is given by regulators has an important result on how cryptocurrencies might evolve.The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is in a weird position since many of the ICOs have been done on top of Ethereum\u2019s platform.Even for Ethereum itself, there is a major point of concern is the presale of ETH tokens in 2014.According to Cointelegraph, in total, 31,000 BTC were raised by the Ethereum Foundation to fund the development of Ethereum \u2014 worth around $18.3 mln at the time (and about $300 mln at press time).Ethereum does Not Believe it is a SecurityThe Ethereum team itself has been careful to play by the books:\u201cWe spent a tremendous amount of time with lawyers in the US and in other countries, and are extremely comfortable that it is not a security; it never was a security\u2026 many regulators that matter understand what Ethereum is.\u201dThe Howey test established in 1946 is one of the methods that can be used to test for criteria of being a security. In layman\u2019s terms, the Howey test is used to determine if the value of a transaction between two parties is dependent on one of the parties work.Since Ethereum\u2019s blockchain requires miners to validate transactions, create new blocks and unlock ETH tokens, Ethereum\u2019s believes the fact that many parties are involved in the work creating value rules out classification as a security.It looks like however the SEC believes every ICO is basically a security. So how can the mother of ICOs not be a security? It\u2019s a legal issues that is destined to change potentially a lot for the future viability of ICOs in America. In South Korea, there\u2019s plans already to legalize them again.FinderEthereum Faces Regulatory ScrutinyConsensus in the crypto community is that Ethereum and Ripple should both be considered as unregistered securities. If Ethereum is squeezed to prove it is not a security in courts, it could be a huge blow to its viability as being the leading smart contract platform in the world as if the SEC chooses to label Ethereum as a security, the foundation will likely take the matter to the courts. This could end up in a legal battle that could last a number of years. Ether might pass the Howey Test, but that doesn\u2019t automatically qualify it as a security in this case. It\u2019s on the hot seat today, May 7th, 2018.What do you think, is Ethereum a security?

Click for interactive version.For a long time, I\u2019ve wondered about the amount of ether that has been lost to typos. It happens whenever someone sends ether to a nonexistent address. Maybe you type \u201cd1\u201d instead of \u201c1d\u201d \u2014 and the ether is gone.Never type Ethereum addresses!When Nick Johnson challenged the Ethereum community to guess the amount of ether lost to typos up to block 5 million, I finally decided to give it a go.Heuristics for Lost EtherWe\u2019ll never know the exact amount, but we can get pretty close to a lower boundary. To understand how this works, let me go over a few basic Ethereum account facts.There are two major types of accounts in Ethereum: External Accounts and Contract Accounts. External Accounts are those accounts that are secured with a private/public key pair + a password. If you own ether and don\u2019t leave it to the custody of a centralized exchange, you control an External Account. That means you can send transactions on the account\u2019s behalf (i.e. Alice can send 1 ETH from her External Account to Bob\u2019s External Account). Contract Accounts are accounts that have associated code. They are also called Smart Contracts. External Accounts can call their functions and the contract reacts to them according to its internal rules. Both types of accounts have an address, a 40 character identifier that looks like this:0x2910543Af39abA0Cd09dBb2D50200b3E800A63D2For External Accounts, the address is derived from the public key. For Contract Accounts, it is derived from the address of its creator + some additional data (the nonce). Most importantly: you don\u2019t get to choose or create your account address. If you could, users would just pick an account with a high ether balance, create a public/private key pair for it, and control the funds.Because the address you create is quasi-random, there cannot be two similar addresses with an existing private key. There are 16\u2074\u2070 different Ethereum addresses and 40\u00d7(16\u20131)=600 addresses that differ by one character from a given address A. Given perfect entropy and uniform distribution of KECCAK-256, the probability of creating a new account B for a given address A that differs by only one character is 600 out of 16\u2074\u2070 or 1 out of 2.4\u00d710\u2074\u2075 or 1 out of 2,435,836,062,218,171,530,339,474,721,193,805,032,759,887,571.That is so extremely unlikely that we can say: If such a pair of addresses exists in the Ethereum state, it is reasonable to conclude that one of them had funds sent to it in error.Let\u2019s look at the following example. Both of the addresses in the box below have an ether balance > 0. The nonce of 17 for Address A means that so far, it has sent 17 transactions. The only difference between them is the first character: one has a \u201c5\u201d the other a \u201c4\u201d. To measure this difference, we use the concept of edit distance, which was originally formulated by Vladimir Levenshtein in 1965. Edit distance describes the amount of edits you have to do to get from one string to the other \u2014 in the example the addresses have an edit distance of 1.Address                                     Nonce   View TxA: 0x580992b51e3925e23280efb93d3047c82f17e038  17      LinkB: 0x480992b51e3925e23280efb93d3047c82f17e038  0       LinkSo, what do we know?Address A has been used to send funds. Thus, someone has control over it and therefore someone knows its private key.It is not possible to choose an address. Thus, nobody can have control over an address that differs only 1 character from another one that has a public/private key pair.If we find such a pair of addresses, we can conclude that the one without outgoing transactions must be an address where ether was sent in error.ResultsMore than 2,600 typos were madeAt least 12,622 ether are lost foreverIt\u2019s true \u2014 over 12,000 ether were lost to typos until block 5 million. At a valuation of $700 each, that\u2019s $8.84M total.A close analysis offers a small glimpse into the story behind these blunders. I imagine some of these losses were more painful than others. Approximately 8 ether were lost because someone mined to a wrong address (this is where they should have gone). About a year and a half ago, another user lost 2,400 ether attempting to pay out from an exchange. At the time, that was $27,000. Now, that amounts to over $2M.Click image for interactive versionYou can download the raw data here.Methodology: Considerations and LimitationsDefinitions:Typo candidates: accounts that have a balance > 0, never sent a Tx (nonce = 0), have no code, and don\u2019t start with \u201c0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000\u201d (built-ins and commonly used as burn addresses).Comparator accounts: real accounts. They are either contracts (have a code hash) or have sent at least one Tx (nonce > 0).Three methods were used to identify the actual typos:Naive (Hamming distance) O(n\u00b2) [1]BK-Trees [2, 3] O(n)A fuzzy model [4]The naive approach works well until block 4M. After that, the number of addresses in Ethereum grows too high and an O(n\u00b2) approach becomes infeasible (for block height 4M, the optimized naive approach runs 12 hours on an 8-core machine). BK-Trees, especially fixed query BK-Trees (thanks Nick!), are great for exact results at edit distance 1. Fuzzy search was used to get some more results at edit distance 2. However, this type of model does not provide conclusive results (it will miss some matches).It is possible (but unlikely) that someone has sent ether to Account B (the one with the typo) on purpose, for example to \u201cburn\u201d it\u2013\u2013to make it forever inaccessible. Also, if we find a pair of Addresses A/B that only differ by a few characters, and that have both received ether but haven\u2019t sent any transactions, we cannot know which of the two is the typo, and which is the real address.TakeawaysIt should be clear by now: never manually type out account addresses. The chance of misspelling and sending to the wrong address is just too high. Like any system with human actors, errors have been made and ether has been lost over the history of the Ethereum blockchain. If you don\u2019t want this to happen to you, there are a couple of best practices you can follow:Always copy and paste account addressesCheck the identicon of the target address before sendingUse the checksum version of the addressUse ENS (Ethereum Name Service) addressesI hope this case study serves as both a cautionary tale for users and a call-to-action for anyone who cares about the health of the larger Ethereum ecosystem. Wallet providers, exchanges, developers, even UI designers\u2013\u2013we have an opportunity to create verification measures, checksums, and warning systems that prevent these errors going forward.

Because the exchange did not have enough buy orders on its books to accommodate a sell this large, the price crashed immediately from $317.81 to $224.48; this movement was enough to then trigger a wave of about 800 automatic position liquidations due to margin calls and stop-loss orders, driving the price briefly as low as $0.10, and causing GDAX to suspend trading.This is only the most recent of a series of similar events across crypto exchanges, and rather than being a reflection on GDAX in particular, it\u2019s a symptom of the underlying problems created by the stress of capital flow increasing faster than market infrastructure development.What does this mean for investors?Although the price quickly returned back above $300, the millions of dollars that investors lost due to forced selling of their positions will not be recovered. This incident highlights the relative immaturity of the cryptocurrency trading ecosystem, which has been stressed by a 20x increase in daily trading volume since the start of 2017 without any fundamental change in market structures.From the trader-in-question\u2019s side (assuming they were simply trying to get out of this position in a crude way and not a malicious actor or market manipulator) dumping the whole position at once will have likely incurred millions in liquidity costs. A single huge move like this is both bad for them and for the margin traders who were forced out of positions at even worse prices, all due to price actions that would be easily avoidable through more intelligent trading logic.What does this tell us about exchanges?On the other side, the exchange doesn\u2019t have adequate safeguards to prevent such a flash-crash. When a participant has a margin position less than their margin requirements in traditional markets, they are typically given 24\u201348 hours to post collateral. GDAX, on the other hand, seems to instantly liquidate you (with market orders) into their very thin order book. Some version of this problem exists on most crypto exchanges, although a few (like Poloniex) try to mitigate it with simple trading logic to soften the price impact of underwater margin position liquidations.GDAX stop losses operate similarly. For major foreign exchange trading pairs in traditional markets, the largest differential between a person\u2019s stop loss and actual execution price is ~0.10%. On GDAX, people who had stop losses at $316 actually sold their ether at $0.10. Furthermore, GDAX does not specify if stop orders are time-priority based or price based. For example, if someone has a stop loss order at $50, and someone puts a stop loss order later at $100, when a flash crash occurs, who gets to sell their ether first? The thin order book combined with their liquidation rules expose the exchange, and traders on the exchange, to events like this one.While this creates a short term windfall in margin calls for the exchange\u2019s owners, they pay that price in reputation and deterring players from trading crypto on margin. The uncertainty a trader has to live with in this environment is one of the major barriers to entry for the large institutional pools of capital that can bring the crypto markets into maturity and raise the overall market cap to the size of traditional asset classes.While these events are frustrating due to the negative impact they have on the space as a whole, they are also exciting because they illustrate the massive opportunity present for those willing to do the work to build out sophisticated financial infrastructure.How does Omega One solve this problem?The Omega One platform, which will be launched later in 2017, will provide a structural solution to problems like this, protecting both traders and exchanges.If the trader who put the $30m order on GDAX had put the order in on Omega One, the market would barely have moved at all. Instead, the Omega trading engine would have taken this trader\u2019s order and broken it into thousands of tiny sell orders, and placed those orders intelligently over time across all the world\u2019s liquid crypto exchanges.The order books on GDAX, Poloniex, Bitfinex, Kraken, and other exchanges would each have seen a tiny increment of additional selling pressure in the first seconds after the order \u2014 enough to absorb the available demand to buy on those exchanges, but not enough to force a price move.As those initial sell orders were traded, the Omega One trading engine would have monitored the outcomes and adjusted behavior accordingly within milliseconds, releasing sell orders to the market at exactly the pace that the market could absorb. Instead of pushing the entire order into one place within one second and thus crashing the market, Omega One would have spread the order out over all the world\u2019s crypto exchanges over the space of perhaps an hour, and nobody would be any the wiser for it.In addition to not losing millions of dollars and crashing the market, the unknown trader from Wednesday would have also have avoided the risk of putting their millions of dollars worth of crypto in the hands of an exchange. In order to sell the Ether on GDAX, they first needed to send that Ether to GDAX, giving up custody of their funds and trusting GDAX not to be hacked or otherwise compromise their funds.If the unknown trader had been using Omega One, they could have kept their funds on the Ethereum blockchain in a wallet under their control, right up until the point of settlement. The combination of security and cost benefits provided by Omega One will transform the crypto markets, facilitating the next level of maturity of the crypto trading ecosystem.For more information, and to sign up to receive the forthcoming Omega One white paper, please visit https://omega.one/.Update (Jun 26, 4:30pm): \u201cIn an unprecedented move, GDAX will pay out of its own company pockets to \u2018affected customers who had margin calls or stop loss orders executed.\u2019\u201d Source here.Like this piece?

We will start a refund program\uff0cbecause a lot of people couldn\u2019t join the ICO. With the refund program participants of the ICO can get a refund for their HER tokens*Explanation of the Basic PrincipleIn the HER crowd-sale contract, a refund function interface is provided. Through this interface, the users who have participated in the ICO can easily get a refund, by invoking the data with parameters the crowd-sale contract will do the following:1. Verify if the initiator has authorized the crowd-sale contract to manipulate the token it holds.2. If the authorization is verified, the crowd-sale contract will initiate transactions of the token held by the initiators according to the number of parameters they send (the parameter number shouldn\u2019t be larger than the authorization limit, otherwise it will not work). This means that a certain amount of the initiators\u2019 HER will be deducted.3. According to the ICO price the crowd-sale contract will enter the converted ETH into the initiator\u2019s address, and thus the refund is completed.* The allowed refund time is within 1 month after the end of ICO.* Participation is only possible if the tokens are not traded.Below we have provided a detailed breakdown of the steps to follow in the process to get the refund. If you are experienced with Ethereum development, you don\u2019t have to be limited to this tutorial, and please invoke the Ethereum contract according to your personal preferences.When will the refund open?The refund will be opened from 10:00 am till 11:00 am UTC every Thursday.Specific steps1. How to be eligible for the refundPlease send an email to market@heronode.io with your crowd-sale transaction hash to get the qualification.2. Environment preparationAll the operations are completed at https://www.myetherwallet.com/#contracts. Please make sure that you can successfully log into MyEtherWallet before continuing.3. Authorize the crowd-sale contract to manipulate your HER token.The contract cannot deduct your HER token automatically without your permission, so this step requires your authorization.1. Go to https://www.myetherwallet.com/#contracts. and in the Contract Address box put HER\u2019s contract address:0x491c9a23db85623eed455a8efdd6aba9b911c5df.2.

In _spender, enter the crowd-sale contract address: 0xf00fcd9119f93a1069054e4280970a75614ad7c9.6. The parameter _value is the total number of HERs in your wallet times 1\u2070\u00b9\u2078. Now suppose you participated in the crowd-sale with 1 ETH and got back 21,000 HER, then the value you fill in is 21,000 * 10 ^ 18 = 21,000,000,000,000,000,000,000. So before you finally write it in, please make sure that you have replaced the \u201c21,000\u201d with the amount of HER in your wallet and have added eighteen 0s at the end of it.7. Log into Ethereum by MetaMask or by your own account.8. Click the Write button at the bottom.9. In the pop-up \u201cWarning! \u201cdialogue box, set the \u201camount\u201d to 0, \u201cgas limit\u201d to 100,000, and click \u201csubmit\u201d.10. Check the transaction status and make sure the invoking will be processed correctly.4. Start to redeem ETHIf you have finished Step 3, you can now call the contract to redeem your Ethereum.1. Similar to Step 3.1, go to https://www.myetherwallet.com/#contracts, in the \u201cContract Address \u201cbox pun in HER\u2019s contract address: 0xf00fcd9119f93a1069054e4280970a75614ad7c9.2. Copy the HER Crowd-sale Contract ABI and paste it into the text box in the ABI/JSON Interface.3. Click the Access button.4. In the following \u201cRead / Write Contract\u201d part, select Refund method.5. In \u201cValue\u201d, enter the amount you authorized in step 3.6. Please be consistent, such as 21,000,000,000,000,000,000,0006. Select the Ethereum account.7. Click the Write button at the bottom.8. In the pop-up \u201cWarning! \u201cdialogue box, set the \u201camount\u201d to 0, \u201cgas limit\u201d to 100,000, and click \u201csubmit\u201d.9. Check the transaction status and make sure the invoking will be processed correctly.If you have completed all the steps above, your HER will be transferred out, then the crowd-sale contract will put the ETHs into your Ethereum account.5. Close HER authorization (optional)In principle, a crowd-sale contract does not actively access your account, but if you still feel unsafe, you can close the HER accessibility authorization for crowd-sale contracts (supporting only HER, not other token access).You need to do the following:Repeat step 3 and set the parameter _value to 0, and Write again.\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 End \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014In an open world, Hero Node welcomes any and all feedback.

As this becomes evident to others in the market, look for the dollar value of ether to collapse. . . to zero or near zero.This could set up the perfect storm. . . the dollar collapse of ether could have a ripple effect (no pun intended) on bitoin. Will a zero dollar ethereum lead to $2000 bitcoin? Or drive bitcoin into a double top? I have no idea.Tone Vays and Tyler Jenks remain unimpressed by the Bitcoin rally . . . they see it running into major problems as a death cross in moving averages seems imminent.Tone Vays Trading WorkshopsTone Vays Trading WorkshopsTone Vays Trading Workshopstonevays.comTyler Jenks (@LucidInvestment) | TwitterThe latest Tweets from Tyler Jenks (@LucidInvestment). President of Lucid Investment with over 40 years experience in\u2026twitter.comMy own view is that since bitcoin blew through 6850 and went to 7600 without allowing anyone on board unless they entered with a buy stop or market order, we should not go back. . . . if this is a legitimate bull. If you followed this Ugly Old Goat you have a Tiger by the Tail. . . and the taking some home by trimming is the wise thing to do.And if you were brave enough to add to your longs at 6850 at least take that part home and let the balance ride.If you are long and want to double down or if you missed the move and looking to step in, you can buy the dip and use a close stop. We might take out the previous days lows, but most likely we just pause here before another leg up. . . . if this is a true bull we have kissed bye bye to $7000 for a very long time.Again, these are treacherous markets. We have now gone high enough to get a lot of people bullish. . . some extremely bullish. . . the push seems primarily due to some large trapped short positions, the SEC ETF ruling coming on August 10 and the flight to safety by wise eth holders. https://medium.com/@homeytel/flight-to-safety-f733f734b414The general public has yet to catch on as the eth dollar price rallied slightly. When this reverses look out below for eth.Will the eth collapse continue to rally bitcoin? Probably, so long as it collapses relative to btc. But when eth collapses in fiat dollar price this could reek enough havoc to bring a short lived collapse in bitcoin, which is the healthiest scenario in the long run. (The Perfect Storm) https://medium.com/@homeytel/how-to-achieve-the-same-results-of-a-professional-trader-without-taking-the-inherent-risks-f35809182a2bPersonally, I believe eth will go under .03 btc before btc goes under $5,000. This is simply the dawn of the ExTHit. . . a catastrophe waiting to happen.Since June eth has dropped from .08 to under .069 measured in BitcoinSince June Eth has rallied from $420 to $500 measured in fiatHope this helps.Thank you for your support.UOG", "responses": 2, "tags": ["Ethereum"]}, {"title": "Ether Review #69 \u2014 IOTA & the Post-Blockchain Era", "post_link": "https://etherreview.info/ether-review-69-iota-the-post-blockchain-era-591f00e2ea5d?source=search_post", "author_name": "Arthur Falls", "author_link": "https://etherreview.info/@arthurfalls", "publish_date": "2017-07-18", "last_modified_date": "2018-05-03", "readtime": "1.01", "claps": 738, "voters": 64, "content": "Ether Review #69 \u2014 IOTA & the Post-Blockchain EraArthur FallsFollowJul 18, 2017 \u00b7 2 min readDavid S\u00f8nsteb\u00f8, co-founder of IOTA, discusses this next-generation post-blockchain platform designed to serve as the backbone for the Internet-of-Things (IoT).IOTA is a groundbreaking new open-source distributed ledger that does not use a blockchain. Its innovative new quantum-proof protocol, known as the Tangle, gives rise to unique new features like zero fees, infinite scalability, fast transactions, secure data transfer and many others.Because the Tangle uses a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) instead of a blockchain, users automatically act as validators, allowing transaction validation to become an intrinsic property of utilising the network. Each transaction requires the sender to verify two previous transactions, resulting in infinite scalability while avoiding the validation centralization that is common with existing consensus mechanisms.IOTA is also developing a novel standard for embedding minuscule ASIC chips in all IoT devices. These chips perform nominal proof-of-work hashes in order to prevent spam and Sybil attacks, and because the network is partition-tolerant and only eventually consistent, brute force hashing attacks are prevented.With a transaction volume limited only by the speed of light, IOTA is a promising new solution to the limitations presented by blockchains.iota.orgtwitter.com/iotatokentwitter.com/davidsonsteboconsensys.netconsensysmedia.nethttps://itunes.apple.com//podcast/the-ether-review/id899090462?mt=2IOTA Whitepaper", "responses": 2, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Decentralization", "IoT", "Internet of Things", "Podcast"]}, {"title": "Into the ether", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@LBXSocial/into-the-ether-932aa18383d7?source=search_post", "author_name": "LBX", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@LBXSocial", "publish_date": "2018-11-01", "last_modified_date": "2018-11-01", "readtime": "2.52", "claps": 944, "voters": 46, "content": "Our token sale is now live.Into the etherMarket Report: 1st Nov. 2018 \u2014 Subscribe to our newsletter.LBXFollowNov 1, 2018 \u00b7 3 min readCRYPTO NOTEThe daily view from our deskIn news that won\u2019t come as a surprise, GCHQ are on Instagram, but they\u2019re not spying on you (well they are), they\u2019ve created their own account!

Keep in mind I\u2019m not a trader and that I do not even pretend to play one on television.There are two ways to think about the price of ether. One is that the markets are irrational and populated by degenerate gamblers, in which case you can stop reading now: assume the price is random and that\u2019s that.The other there may be some correlation between the confidence in the platform and the way the platform delivers on its promises. Let\u2019s look at what could have caused the price of ether to drop slowly but surely during the second half of 2016.Chart courtesy of the good people at https://www.cryptocompare.comIt\u2019s (almost) been two yearsThe original roadmap for Ethereum will be two years old in roughly three months time. Many had read into this blog post that we\u2019d be approaching Serenity by now. Instead, we\u2019re inching our way towards Metropolis.Do you remember \u201cThe Bomb,\u201d the programmed mining difficulty increase that would (hopefully) mark the switch to PoS? It\u2019s still ticking, and I\u2019m sure will prove itself to be a great motivator to iterate more rapidly. May 2017 is approaching awfully fast, and \u2018defusing\u2019 the bomb by hardforking would probably be interpreted as a failure to deliver on time.O Web Three, Where Art Thou?Metropolis was supposed to introduce \u201ca relatively full-featured user interface for non-technical users of Ethereum\u201d, marking the formal launch of Mist, complete with DApp store and \u201cbase applications\u201d which could have included a contract registry, reputation system, etc. In essence, the building blocks of Web Three.Web Three is in my humble opinion what makes Ethereum revolutionary: a genuinely decentralized web, where Dapps are distributed as compressed files over a P2P network, where there are no servers and no possibility of censorship. If an Ethereum fan has ever approached you, eyes widened, arms flailing, talking excitedly as if they\u2019d seen the future, it\u2019s probably because of Web Three, and in particular because of this must watch, inspiring video by Alex Van de Sande:Mist is under active development but the dapp store, reputation systems and end-user ready content is nowhere to be seen. Instead, Metropolis will instead include EIP 86 (\u201caccount security abstraction\u201d), EIP 96 (\u201cblockhash and state root changes\u201d) and \u201cPrecompiled/native contracts for elliptic curve operations and big integer arithmetic\u201d.While Blockchain nerds like myself salivate at the sound of these exciting new improvements, it\u2019s going to get increasingly difficult to keep an audience interested in what ultimately feels more and more like a scientific research endeavor rather than a practical new take on how we interact online.The Network Effect (or lack thereof)The Ethereum\u2019s network is not driven by decisions from \u201con high\u201d. The DAO fork proved this, where a majority voted with their feet for a new chain, while others preferred to use another version. Forking to a new network is only a matter of a majority of users configuring a parameter in their existing clients or switching clients altogether. Considering the breadth of the project, there are relatively few of these clients, and I suspect most \u2014 if not all \u2014 of these are miners.In other words, the whole network could move to a different consensus algorithm in the blink of an eye as there is no real network effect to speak of. Ironically, the most common application on this crowdfunded platform is\u2026 more crowdfunders (including the rather misguided \u2018ICOs\u201d). To date, a Dapp has yet to demonstrate a critical mass of users while exclusively leveraging Ethereum as its foundation.This, in turn, makes the whole enterprise surprisingly fragile. I\u2019ve often wondered what would happen if a Google or Mozilla suddenly announced some form of native blockchain support: with their backing and connections they could easily onboard several \u2018killer\u2019 launch apps, ready for consumption by their billion + user base. In fact, they could probably even copy the inner workings of Ethereum and few would be likely to notice, or care.ConclusionAs a developer, I don\u2019t play the markets and hold very little crypto, yet my life revolves around building practical applications on the Ethereum platform. Without a shadow of a doubt, Ethereum is years ahead of its alternatives, and that some of the Foundation\u2019s staff displays technical abilities that are quite simply second to none.You might then wonder about the recent spike in Bitcoin price. Why is BTC so \u201c\u2018successful\u201d? Outdated, boring Bitcoin which never innovates, bogged down in the quagmire of its often toxic community. Yet, its market cap was nearing $15 billion this morning. Well, this valuation may not be entirely crazy after all. The only \u201capplication\u201d of Bitcoin is, ultimately, to be an alternative to FIAT money \u2014 something at which it excels, not because of its technical prowess, but simply in terms of sheer adoption. A high price, a high market cap: these not the means to an end: they are Bitcoin\u2019s primary objectives.Ethereum, on the other hand, has a completely different value proposition and contrasting objectives. The price of Ether, be it $100 or 10 cent, does not affect how easy or how difficult it is to publish Ethereum applications. It doesn\u2019t even affect the cost of interacting with dapps, as it is mitigated by the concept of gas.As an application developer and end user, Ethereum\u2019s price does not affect me one iota \u2014 but conversely Ethereum\u2019s application landscape, toolset, feature set, community, ecosystem, Foundation support and corporate adoption to date are of the utmost importance, all of which can and will affect the price!It\u2019s a proposition an order of magnitude more complex than Bitcoin, which, when mixed with the heavy speculation common to this industry, leads to a very volatile and unpredictable \u201ccrypto-fuel\u201d.About the AuthorStephan Tual is the Founder and COO of Slock.it.Previously CCO for the Ethereum project, Stephan has three startups under his belt and brings 20 years of enterprise IT experience to the Slock .it project.

Today, I\u2019m going to flip the script and talk about Ethereum\u2019s plan to eliminate the need for heavy duty computing power, and why that may not be such a bad thing from a financial perspective.Recap of Proof-of-WorkIf you\u2019re familiar with the idea of cryptocurrency mining, you know that in order to keep a blockchain running smoothly, it takes a lot of computing power to verify new transactions. This process, known as mining, is currently used by both Bitcoin and Ethereum to maintain their blockchains.One of the main issues with mining is the vast amount of electricity that it uses. Vitalik Buterin, the creator of Ethereum, has estimated that the amount of electricity needed to mine Bitcoin and Ethereum runs up a $1M daily bill (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiKnWBPkQ4I&feature=youtu.be). Another study recently showed that the amount of electricity consumed by the Bitcoin mining network is comparable to the energy used by all of Ireland (https://karlodwyer.github.io/publications/pdf/bitcoin_KJOD_2014.pdf).If things continue as-is, cryptos are going to be a big problem for the environment.Ethereum has a plan to fix that.Proof-of-StakeMining fills a big need \u2014 providing consensus among network participants regarding the state of the world of historical and current transactions. Because miners solve complicated problems using transaction information and cryptography, what they do is referred to as proof-of-work.There are, however, other methods for getting a group of disparate participants to agree on transactions. The most popular of which is referred to as proof-of-stake.The basic idea is as follows.Instead of miners competing to solve really tough math problems, the network will instead use a pool of validators. Validators are people that are willing to stake their cryptocurrency on the blocks of transactions that they claim should be added to the public blockchain.When someone is selected to validate a block (or, in some cases, propose a set of transactions that should be added together as a new block), they stake some of their crypto on their proposal. Users would be chosen as the lead to validate a new block on a pseudo-random basis, weighted by the amount of crypto they\u2019re willing to stake.As blocks get added to the chain, new validators then stake additional crypto on new blocks that are added on top of prior blocks. As chains grow, validators are incentivized to validate the chains that have the most crypto staked in their contained transactions, as well as to validate chains that contain crypto staked on previous blocks that they\u2019ve put crypto up against.As more and more blocks get validated, these validators get a portion of the transaction fees that are included in each transaction \u2014 so in a sense, they\u2019re earning interest on the crypto that they\u2019ve staked. Assuming that they\u2019ve staked crypto on valid transactions, they\u2019ll be able to reclaim their original crypto and their claimed interest after some point in time has passed (or when they remove themselves from the validator pool).The ImplicationsBecause proof-of-stake doesn\u2019t involve competing to solve heavy duty complications, it eliminates a large part of the energy requirements needed to mine.It also introduces a few interesting concepts, such as the idea of staking Ether on new transactions, losing one\u2019s stake if they try to validate a fraudulent or otherwise incorrect transaction, eliminating potential threads such as a 51% attack, while introducing new threats specific to the new protocol.If and when Proof-of-Stake is implemented, it would be a major shift in the world of cryptos. There\u2019s no telling how the market will react, and it\u2019s likely it would need to be done as a hard-fork, causing a good amount of volatility.Fortunately, Ethereum isn\u2019t slated to switch over to proof-of-stake for a while (at least until 2018, I believe).When it does, though, there could be some very interesting implications for investors in Ether.Many are suggesting that since there\u2019s no longer a large need to compensate miners with new tokens, the creation of new Ether may be significantly or completely eliminated. Going one step further, it could even mean that existing Ether is eliminated when bad transactions aren\u2019t included into the main blockchain.This could mean that the supply of Ether will significantly decrease, causing a dramatic increase in its value. On top of that, any user can now stake some of their Ether in order to validate blocks (as long as they are able to stake the minimum amount, to be finalized by Ethereum\u2019s core developers), earning interest on their existing stake.And since new Ether will likely no longer be created by mining, it could mean that existing holders of Ethereum will benefit disproportionately from the process of proof-of-stake due to their ability to put their existing Ether to work at a larger and faster stake than newcomers (this mostly applies to retail investors and not institutions with large amounts of capital).All-in-all, it\u2019s hard to say whether Ethereum will switch to proof-of-stake, and if they do, when that may be. However, Vitalik has always included proof-of-stake in his core roadmap, and he\u2019s produced multiple white papers on how he plans to implement it, so my guess would be that it gets done.And if it does, current ETH holders may benefit greatly.Note, if you\u2019re interested in learning more about proof-of-stake, I found the following resources to be helpfulhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiKnWBPkQ4I&feature=youtu.behttps://www.ethnews.com/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake-explained", "responses": 1, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Ethereum", "Proof Of Stake", "Proof Of Work", "Mining"]}, {"title": "The Case for Ether", "post_link": "https://blog.evercoin.com/the-case-for-ether-11f6874be58d?source=search_post", "author_name": "Miko Matsumura", "author_link": "https://blog.evercoin.com/@miko_57080", "publish_date": "2017-08-14", "last_modified_date": "2018-04-05", "readtime": "7.28", "claps": 103, "voters": 47, "content": "The Case for EtherMiko MatsumuraFollowAug 14, 2017 \u00b7 8 min readHow Vitalik and crew could change the game yet again.My Birthday!By the way, it\u2019s my birthday today!

This post is the case for ETH.CaveatUsual caveat, this blog post is not investment advice, and I am not an investment advisor. I\u2019m just a blogger commenting on cool cryptocurrency topics.Ether PricesHere\u2019s the last 60 day BTC/ETH graph on CoingeckoNow one thing to consider is the same time period chart BTC / USDWhat does this mean? My way of reading this chart is that ETH right now is very cheap compared to BTC. Watch the BTC /ETH pair, not the ETH / USD pair. Watching the BTC / ETH pair was advice I got from Josh Goldbard from the CryptoLotos Hedge Fund.Why so Cheap?Why is Ether so cheap? I attribute it to several factors:Impact of ICOs: ICO funding just passed VC funding with the huge $252M Filecoin crowdsale via coinlist. A large number of ICOs are based on Ether whether they are ERC20 tokens or they are just using Ether as a medium of transaction to acquire other tokens or SAFT notes. Regardless, the proceeds of ICOs are often liquidated in order to provide operating capital as well as money that can be used by the crowdfunding organization to implement monetary policies (like buybacks). The short version of this is that Billions of dollars are flowing out from ETH in the short to mid term.Bitcoin update: The smooth lock-in of the Segwit \u201cupdate\u201d and the failed \u201cfork\u201d of Bitcoin Cash have dominated the news cycle recently. All of this has been \u201cgood news\u201d for Bitcoin, and all of the buzz has been for Bitcoin which has experienced a \u201crelief rally\u201d.Lack of an Ethereum update: Not only has ETH lacked much of a software update, but there is a lot of buzz and speculation about \u201cCasper\u201d the upcoming update. Vitalik Buterin, the Ethereum founder has yet to commit to a ship date for Casper, and this is causing some consternation. Many people are complaining about the transaction rate in ETH which is currently as of this writing at about 330,000 per day. 330,000 transactions per day is 13,750 per hour or 229 per minute or less than 4 transactions per second. Plasma.io may help, more on this later.Complexity of upcoming update: The other thing weighing on ETH other than performance is the speculative nature of Casper. Casper proposes to move the entire governance model for Ethereum from Proof-of-Work (Nakamoto Consensus) to Proof-of-Stake, which is less proven.Bitcoin brand dominance: many new players are entering the space including larger retail investors and funds. Goldman Sachs recently said Bitcoin could no longer be ignored.Ethereum Competition Coming: Stratis, Lisk, Waves, EOS, Tezos, Next, Ark, Aragon, ASCH, XEM, Stellar, Rootstock/Bitcoin are on the short list of what could be called competitors to Ethereum blockchain for the dominant dApp platform. Each of these has a unique approach to dApp platform support, although Gavin Wood is building a multi-chain called polka dot (which has a beautifully pink polka dotted \u201cwhite\u201d paper) which may also create interoperability between many chains.Distribution of valueAt the moment Bitcoin is at $70,726,440,113 or about 70 Billion USD in total market cap and the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies is $139,377,101,141 which is approximately 50.7% of the total. So interestingly , Bitcoin is worth almost exactly half of the value of all cryptocurrencies. There are a lot of equations that follow this kind of distributionTop 19 Cryptos by current Market Cap (CoinMarketCap.com)\u201cNatural Value\u201d of EthereumThe unknown value is the \u201cnatural value\u201d of Ethereum relative to Bitcoin. At the moment the value of Bitcoin vs all other coins seems to be 50%. The question should first be generalized to the \u201csecond spot\u201d in theory the Silver to Bitcoin\u2019s gold. Although Charlie Lee\u2019s Litecoin is often called \u201cSilver\u201d to Bitcoin\u2019s \u201cGold\u201d, by pure market cap analysis, the number two slot belongs to Ethereum.So it\u2019s currently unknowable what the \u201ccorrect\u201d ratio between the #1 cryptocurrency is and the #2, and the current ratio is floating at Ether being 39.7% of the value of Bitcoin.For a while during the ETH run up in price, there was a lot of talk about \u201cFlippening\u201d or the flip of #1 coin to ETH. While this talk has largely died down, this is still a remote possibility depending on how Segwith 2x goes in November and how the next few updates go in Ethereum.Suppressed valueOne way of looking at it is that Ether has a \u201cnatural value\u201d as the #2 coin behind Bitcoin, and that this value is being suppressed by the emergence of viable competitors and by fears and uncertainties about Ethereum\u2019s future roadmap.Ethereum ScalingAs far as scaling, one exciting proposal for Ethereum is the emergence of the Plasma proposal. I cover it in more detail in my piece \u201cHow big a deal is Plasma.io\u201d Joseph Poon and Vitalik Buterin have proposed using Merkleization sidechains as a way to create a vast network of efficiently intercommunicating sidechains that could bring Ethereum contract execution scale up to potentially billions of transactions per second. This is an insane rate of transaction rate considering that the VISA network credit card processing system completes an estimated 2000 transactions per second.Maturity of competitionAs far as other \u201ccompetitive blockchains\u201d including Stratis, Lisk, Waves, EOS, Tezos, Next, Ark, Aragon, ASCH, XEM, Stellar, Rootstock/Bitcoin there are few that have an appreciable market cap (NEM/XEM at about 2 Billion, Stratis at 610M, Waves at 468M), and few actually shipped networks with live transactions.So what is the case for Ether?Interestingly enough, if a \u201ccompetitive blockchain\u201d is successful in creating a wave of ICOs (for example, Stellar is launching Mobius and Vinny Lingham has talked about moving Civic onto Rootstock, Bitcoin\u2019s smart contract platform) \u2014 those platforms themselves should follow the fate of Ether and actually decrease in value as tokens flow away from the platform and into the applications.Ether as a platform is being vastly undervalued due to ICO mechanicsThe thesis is that the flow of value *AWAY* from platforms like Ethereum and into its apps is artificial. This is due to the current mechanics of ICOs, many of which use Ethereum smart contracts to exchange Ether for ERC20 tokens. This actually causes huge applications to *decrease* the economic value of the platform that they run on. This is just an artifact of how ICOs are conducted today. In reality, the reverse should be happening \u2014 that every single huge application that launches on Ethereum should increase the value of Ether. Any competitor of Ethereum should face similar dynamics (unless they come up with a way for ICO participants to pay using other currencies).Segwit isn\u2019t overBitcoin\u2019s governance problems aren\u2019t over. The existence of a fundamental flaw in Nakamoto Consensus is the tendency of miners to gain extraordinary hash power through custom ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuits) systems like ASICBoost. This fundamental schism has enabled China to acquire 60% of global hashing power for Bitcoin and thus create a potential rift in the governance of Bitcoin. Although Bitcoin Cash was not successful in creating a 51% attack on Bitcoin and creating a miner activated hard fork, the story is far from over. The schism continues to exist and the Segwit2x Hard Fork crew remain committed to push ahead in November.The schism in Bitcoin is fundamental to the current state of Nakamoto consensus, and a fork of Ethereum or the creation of any dominant Proof-of-Stake blockchain could have huge positive implications for decentralized governance of blockchains if successful.Bitcoin is KingHere\u2019s something significant to consider. Right now people are continuing to think of Bitcoin as king, and yes, to some extent when people say \u201cBitcoin\u201d they may be generalizing about all of cryptocurrency. People who say \u201cBitcoin is as significant as (or more significant than) the Internet\u201d (I\u2019m actually someone who says something like that) they don\u2019t exactly mean \u201cBitcoin\u201d. It\u2019s not an exact equivalency, The Internet vs Bitcoin. What they are saying is a combination of things including \u201cblockchain based currencies are beginning to decentralize financial services and are beginning a wave of decentralization that is likely to sweep across as many vertical industries as the internet, but the fact that this is money transacting will enable the net impact to be much greater.\u201d So the \u201cbeginning of decentralized applications\u201d is really Ethereum at the moment, with more to come.Ether can deliverThe core of the thesis on investing in Ether comes down to a few core thingsPrice is good now: the last 60 days of BTC/ETH price decline has led to a very favorable time to move BTC into ETH.ICO mania: ICO mania shows Ethereum is more valuable not less. ETH prices due to ICO mechanics are artificially suppressed. The value of Ether should go UP after a major ICO when the price actually falls (due to how smart contracts exchange ETH (which is subsequently liquidated for fiat) for ERC20 tokens. This is reversed, and ironically as more competitive platforms mature, they will suffer from this effect as well.N00b money: New money is moving into Bitcoin\u2026 many new Coinbase accounts being made. The first pit stop after buying Bitcoins for new money is to buy ETH.Vitalik and crew could yet deliver: right now things have been quiet. The recent reveal on the Plasma white paper is a hint at massive performance scaling updates to come, and Casper, if successful could be a huge transformation not just of Ethereum but of blockchain models in general.The biggest one of these is 4. If Ethereum core delivers Proof-of-Stake, they have changed the game in a fundamental way and we could potentially even see Flippening.This post is solely the opinion of the author and does not reflect the views of Evercoin or anyone else.Thanks for reading.If you liked it, please click the heart, follow button or retweet/repost.", "responses": 2, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Ethereum", "Bitcoin", "Cryptocurrency", "Fintech"]}, {"title": "Get Ether For The Miner One Crowdsale", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@minerone.io/get-ether-for-the-miner-one-crowdsale-be7427fa62ec?source=search_post", "author_name": "Miner One", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@minerone.io", "publish_date": "2018-02-13", "last_modified_date": "2018-05-06", "readtime": "4.48", "claps": 485, "voters": 47, "content": "Get Ether For The Miner One CrowdsaleMiner OneFollowFeb 13, 2018 \u00b7 5 min readDuring the Miner One Crowdsale, Miner One Tokens (MIO) can be purchased with ether (ETH) as well as bitcoin (BTC), litecoin (LTC), or euro (EUR). If you want to pay in BTC, LTC, or EUR, we will convert your payment into ETH in order to determine how much MIO you will receive.You may find it most convenient to pay in ETH, since you will need some of the same tools to receive and hold your MIO Tokens and Miner One payouts (in ETH).If you want to obtain Miner One Tokens (MIO) during the Miner One Crowdsale, you will need what\u2019s called an \u201cERC20 token-compatible wallet\u201d. This wallet will also let you receive and hold Miner One payouts (in ETH). ERC20 is a standard that allows tokens like MIO to use the Ethereum network.It\u2019s not difficult to create a personal ERC20 token-compatible wallet of your choice (e.g., MyEtherWallet, MetaMask, Mist, Parity, imToken, etc.). You\u2019ll find an extended list of such wallets here and instructions below on how to buy ETH once you have the appropriate wallet.NOTE: After you have paid for your ETH, make sure the coins are deposited into your personal wallet. This is relevant mainly when buying ETH from an exchange. If you leave your coins on the exchange and the exchange gets hacked or becomes insolvent, you may end up losing your coins.BY CREDIT CARDApart from the fees charged by these providers, your bank may charge additional fees.Coinbase is one of the easiest ways to buy ETH with a credit card. The fees will be around 3.75 percent and you can buy instantly. Check supported countries.Coinmama is also a good option because you can buy less than USD 125 worth of ETH without verifying your identity. You can instantly sign up, purchase, and have ETH in your wallet within about 20 minutes. Coinmama\u2019s BTC rate includes 5.5 percent for the transaction. For credit or debit card transactions, the payment processor charges an additional 5 percent fee. This fee will be added after you choose your method of payment. Check supported countries.CEX.IO offers a variety of options to buy ETH. After you register and pass the verification process, you can buy using any of the payment methods offered. Coverage is worldwide (most countries).BitPanda has some low fee options for buying ETH with a credit card. Check supported countries.Coinhouse. If you live in Europe, you can buy ETH by credit or debit card, or Neosurf from Coinhouse.BY SEPA TRANSFERUse Coinbase if you want to buy ETH by SEPA transfer. The fees are about 1.49 percent.BitPanda has some low fees for buying ETH with a SEPA transfer.CEX.IO offers customers a variety of options to buy ETH. After you register and pass the verification process, you can buy using any of the payment methods offered. Worldwide coverage, 99% of countries.WITH CASHTo pay for ETH in cash, you will first have to change your cash to bitcoin (BTC). Once you\u2019ve purchased BTC, you can use an exchange like Changelly or Binance to exchange your BTC for ETH. Because there is no central bank controlling the BTC exchange rate, each website has its own and rates may vary. If you want to see the average market rate, we recommend having a look at TradeBlock\u2019s XBX Index.CEX.io is a BTC exchange that also sells ETH via credit card. The fees for CEX.io are already calculated into the exchange rate. That\u2019s why exchange rates are different from other exchanges. For example, the exchange rate for ETH on CEX.io can be around 7% higher than on Coinbase. However, CEX.io works worldwide (unlike Coinbase).Coinmama is a worldwide seller of ETH that accepts BTC.Changelly is one of the easiest ways to buy ETH with BTC (or any other altcoin). It takes around 30 minutes to get a coin traded from one type to another and the interface is very clean and intuitive. However, we don\u2019t recommend using Chagelly to buy ETH with fiat currency because the fees are very high.Coinhouse. If you live in Europe, Coinhouse may work for you. The company is a BTC and ETH broker that started out providing services only to people from France and gradually expanded throughout Europe.Bitfinex is a well established exchange that allows you to buy ETH if you live outside of the United States.With PayPalUnfortunately, there is no easy way to buy ETH with PayPal.You\u2019ll have first to buy BTC on a website like V ir W ox, or order BTC from an individual on an exchange like LocalBitcoins. Once you\u2019ve purchased BTC, you can use an exchange like Changelly or Binance to exchange them for ETH.Which Is the Best ETH Exchange?There is no \u201cbest\u201d ETH exchange. You will have to research a bit and find out which is best for you based on your country and payment method. Some exchanges only work in certain countries, so you\u2019ll have to make sure the ETH exchange you use works in your country.How Do I Use My ETH to Pay for MIO?After you buy ETH and transfer it to your ERC20 token-compatible wallet, you should place your order for MIO on www.MinerOne.io. You will receive online instructions on how to send ETH to the Miner One Crowdsale Wallet to pay for your MIO.When sending ETH, set gas limit to 200,000 GAS and 30 GWEI GAS PRICE.Once Miner One starts mining, you will receive your ETH payouts from Miner One to your ERC20 token-compatible wallet. If you like, you will be able to transfer your MIO and receive payouts to the Miner One B-Wallet once it becomes available in July.REMEMBER: MIO Tokens will officially be sold only on www.MinerOne.io. To avoid the possibility of fraud, do not accept offers to buy MIO from anyone or anywhere else during the Crowdsale.Please Note: We do our best to provide accurate information, but cannot be held responsible for the content of non-Miner One media or the actions, fees, and procedures of other service providers.

If you haven\u2019t already, be sure to sign up for the Beta on our homepage.Creator SignupSign up to become an early creator here. Alternatively, you can also support ELIX by reaching out to creators and helping them sign up. These could be entrepreneurs and creators from many different areas outside of crypto. For example, we\u2019re also interested in supporting gamers and gaming accessories. Gamers tend to have an intuitive understanding of crypto since many tradable items and tokens already exist in games.After reaching out to many creators, we\u2019ve found that there is strong demand for a cryptocurrency crowdfunding platform, for three reasons:We have the potential to offer a much more crypto-focused audience, meaning our community is more engaged and interested in crypto related projects than on crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter or Indiegogo.Cryptocurrency holders want to use coins and tokens to crowdfund products and ideas. There\u2019s also the added benefit that people can fully control their own funds through smart contracts.We don\u2019t need to charge a 3\u20135% payment fee like Stripe (reducing cost tends to get people interested fast).Reaching out to entrepreneurs and other creators is a great way to spread the word about ELIX!DesignIn order to increase the user acquisition rate upon launch, we\u2019ve made one small change when users first open the app. First, the app will now go to Boost content on launch. When taking an action in the app like pledging tokens, users will be prompted to create a wallet. This means that fewer users will become lost in the wallet flow early on \u2014 and users understand why they want to create a wallet: to interact with in-app content they already see and enjoy.Here\u2019s a preview of the landing screen with the wallet prompt (there will also be some additional header graphics coming soon):And here is a preview of the creator prompt, shown once a wallet is created:Support for Creator VideosWe plan to integrate video into our platform. Early on, we expect to integrate Youtube videos. Videos allow creators to tell their story and provide insight into their idea or product. Here\u2019s what that integration will look like:Meet The CreatorWe also plan to set up a \u201cMeet The Creator\u201d section where backers can see information about creators on Linkedin, Facebook or Twitter. This will help people gather information about the quality and authenticity of each creator, as well as help build up a strong community of reputable creators. Here\u2019s one proposed implementation by our designer, showing detailed information about a hypothetical creator named Dario:DevelopmentThis week we\u2019ve made lots of improvements to the mobile app! We\u2019ve replaced the old side menu with a tab bar for easier navigation and redesigned the boost and contacts tabs. The new Boost tab gives users the ability to easily filter through projects and save their favorites. Later on we\u2019ll also be adding full-text search to the explore tab. In the contacts tab, users can easily add new contacts or search through their existing ones. After choosing a contact from the list, a newly designed modal pops up displaying the contact\u2019s info and the send/request tokens floating action button. Both users\u2019 favorites and contacts are saved on their device, so users can manage them without fear of this info being public. Check out our recent progress in the demo video below!Support for Ether Crowdfunding: Expanding Our Platform\u2019s UtilityWe\u2019re excited to announce that we also now have a crowdfunding smart contract for Ether. This should expand the utility of our platform by allowing people to crowdfund with a cryptocurrency already held by many crypto enthusiasts. In order to preserve the utility of ELIX, we can offer lower host cuts for ELIX than with ETH. We already have Ether based crowdfunding test scenarios running as expected, since support for ETH requires minimal changes from an engineering standpoint. Much of the automated testing of code logic and work done previously by AE.studio means that the logic of this new ETH based contract is already robust.We look forward to sharing our progress as we move quickly toward out Beta period and beyond!

But what happens if the receiver doesn\u2019t have it? If, for example, you\u2019re sending Ether to a friend who is less familiar with the crypto world but wants to explore it but has no idea where to start. It is clear that he/she would need a lot of help before they can access their first crypto assets.Apart from all that, there are countries where people simply don\u2019t have access to a personal computer and are forced to use the internet on smartphones instead. Without payment terminals or other ways to conveniently transfer value, our solution can be very helpful.Here at Eth2, we made it our mission to help people like that. We came up with the solution that would allow blockchain to grow beyond its current user base. We created a product enticing enough to challenge users to learn more about blockchain and keep them motivated throughout the process. Since phone number is wildly considered a universal ID, owned by almost everyone on the planet and easier to remember than a hexadecimal Ethereum address, it became a foundation for our technology.At Eth2, we are looking to help with the following:Crypto on-boarding. We want to give a person a taste of crypto world and motivate them to study it more on their own.Crypto P2P Communications. We strive to enable users to receive crypto assets even without having a typical ETH address.Crypto Rigidity Problems. Our solution will help to make transfer process more fluid by giving users an option to revert the transaction.How does it work?In short, we linked the crypto transfer process to a person\u2019s phone number. Eth2 only has a few basic requirements: a phone number and ability to install a wallet to store cryptocurrency.To learn more about our technology solution, take a look at the \u201cUsing Escrow Smart Contracts to Secure ETH Transactions with Eth2\u201d article.Sender Instructions.Here is what you need to do to send ETH using Eth2:Open https://eth2.io in the DApp browser of your mobile wallet application (Trust Wallet) or in web browser with installed Metamask extension (has to be unlocked). Web3 allows Eth2 connect to your wallet to interact with blockchain and check the balance;Fill the forms \u2014 phone number of the receiver and amount you are sending, press \u201cSend\u201d;Verify the transaction using your wallet interface;Wait until the transaction is done processing and being secured by a Smart Contract;Get a link with extracted data. Copy and share the message with receiver:Message with link and secret codeHow to send ether to phone numberReceiver instructionsAs we mentioned before, as a company, our goal is to get people interested using crypto BUT we will not do it at the expense of loosing money. That is why, if you fail this process, the crypto assets will be returned to the sender, not lost.There are multiple cases that can occur when receiving ETH. Here, we will talk about the most \u201cinvolved\u201d one.Here is what you need to do to if someone sent you ETH using Eth2:Follow the link from the message that you\u2019ve received. It leads you to intermediary screen prompting to install a wallet application. We partner with Trust Wallet and suggest them for the smoother flow. Press the \u201cUse Trust Wallet\u201d button.

There are a few battle modes under development, and castle mode is coming very soon!In this blog post, we will explain how to interact with Etheremon\u2019s first decentralized Battle System and how Etheremon battle works.1. Battle Power (BP)Battle Power is a single, simplified value that encapsulates all six of an Etheremon\u2019s battle stats: Health Point (HP), Primary Attack (PA), Secondary Attack (SA), Primary Defense (PD), Secondary Defense (SD), and Speed (Sp).Experience (EXP) can only be gained through battle, and increasing EXP will level up Etheremon. Higher level Etheremon have higher stats and are basically stronger. Also, after reaching a certain level, some Etheremons will gain the ability to Transform.2. CastlesIn the Etheremon World, there are special locations called \u201chills\u201d where you can build and defend your own castle. A total of 30\u201chills\u201d have been discovered in the World. Ever since their discovery, MonSeekers have been battling non-stop to claim their possessions and train their Etheremons.2.1. Building and defending a castleOn an empty hill, you can build a castle by hiring a Blockid builder squad at the cost of minimum 0.04 ether for 5 bricks.For every battle lost, the amount of castle\u2019s brick reduces by 1.For every 8 battle won, the amount of castle\u2019s brick increases by 1.The castle would fall if its brick amount reduce to 0.You can increase your castle\u2019s initial strength (e.g: brick amount) by supplying more ether at the start.To defend your castle, you put a team of 3 Etheremons (battlers) supported by up to 3 other Etheremons (supporters).2.2. Attacking a castleYou can attempt to take down a castle by launching attacks to reduce its strength. Your attacking team will also consist of 3 battlers and 3 supporters. In case your attack takes down a castle (last one before it falls), you will scavenge 50% of the castle\u2019s build bricks.3. Battle mechanism3.1. The main gameIn an Etheremon battle, each team will consist of 3 battlers and up to 3 supporters. Battlers will fight each other respectively depending on their positions, meaning first vs first, second vs second and third vs third.In each matchup, the Etheremon with the higher Speed attacks first.The Etheremon takes turn attacking each other.Primary Defense reduces the damage of incoming Primary Attack, Secondary Defense reduces the damage of incoming Secondary Attack.During a turn, whichever attack (either Primary or Secondary Attack) that results in most total damage to the defender will be performed by the attacker, damaging the defenders\u2019 HP.In each turn, the attacker might be able to land a \u201ccritical attack\u201d, which means its Primary Attack/ Secondary Attack will be much higher than normal. This totally depends on chance.The first Etheremon to lose all of its HP loses the fight.The winning Etheremon is rewarded with huge amount of experience and the losing Etheremon also gains experience but of a lesser amount.The remaining battler will continue the matchups.There are total 3 matchups, and the team which triumph in 2 or more matchups wins the overall battle.Supporters (ancestors and gasons) can increase Battle Power for battlers (more details below). Type is also an important factor.3.2. Supporters:Each team consists of up to 3 supporters. They can be battlers\u2019 ancestors or gasons.- A supporting ancestor increases all of its descendant\u2019s offensive stats by 10% (e.g: Primary Attack & Secondary Attack increased 10%). This effect repeats if there are multiple ancestors e.g if there are 2 ancestors of the battling Etheremons present, Primary Attack & Secondary Attack increased by 20%- A supporting gason supports all battlers of its types. These battlers will receive 10% increase in defensive stats (e.g: Primary Defense & Secondary Defense increased by 10%).3.3. Type advantage:Each of the 17 Etheremon types has an advantage over another type. When an Etheremon is battling another Etheremon that it has type advantage over, its offensive stats are increased by 20%.The diagram below reflects all Etheremon types\u2019 relationships:Battle system\u2019s smart contract has been completed (see Github) and will be released very soon.

How to get Ethereum and transfer it to your wallet:* OPTION 1 (pay with crypto, bank transfer) \u2014 Kraken.com* OPTION 2 (pay with crypto, credit card, bank transfer) \u2014 Cex.io3. Alternative ways to get tokensOnce you create your wallet and get Ether, further instructions on how to exchange Ether to BitDegree tokens can be found here and instructions on checking your token balance are here.1. HOW TO CREATE AN ETHER WALLETFirst of all you need to have an Ether wallet. Creating an ether wallet is a must in order to participate in the crowdsale and receive your tokens.RECOMMENDED OPTION 1: MyEtherWalletStep 1: Go to https://www.myetherwallet.com/ and make sure the URL is correct and MYETHERWALLET LLC [US] certificate is there.Step 2: Go to the \u201cNew Wallet\u201d TabStep 3: Enter a Strong PasswordEnter a password that will be used to access your wallet:1. Create a strong password, using upper and lower-case letters, and also numbers and symbols (e.g., \u201c#\u201d, \u201c@\u201d, etc.).2. Do not lose this password. Losing this password is equivalent to losing all ETH and BDG stored in your account. Click on the Create New Wallet button.Step 4: Save Your Keystore FileThis file contains your private and public keys and is required every time you want to access your account.NOTE: you won\u2019t be able to access your account without this file and the password from the previous step. Losing either one of them is equivalent to losing all ETH and BDG stored in your account.Step 5 (optional): Backup Your Private KeyIf you would like to make this account accessible by other Ethereum wallets, you can export and backup your private key.You should never share your private keys with anyone else. If your wallet address is the equivalent of your bank account number, then your private wallet key is your PIN. If anyone obtains your private key, they will have access to all of your funds.Step 6: Unlock Your Wallet to View the Public AddressFollow the instructions to unlock your wallet and get your public address:Select the Keystore File (UTC / JSON) and select the keystore file you\u2019ve downloaded in the previous step.Input the password you set on step 3 and click on the Unlock button to unlock it.Step 7: Save Your Public AddressNow that you have created the wallet you should now be able to see your Ethereum public address under the Your Address label or the Account Address section.You will need to provide this public address during your registration for the BitDegree token sale.You will need to provide this public address to transfer ETH to your wallet.Do not lose your password and the keystore file, as you will need to use them in the BitDegree token sale.ALTERNATIVE OPTION 2: MetaMask(Note: if you already have MyEtherWallet, you may skip this alternative option and proceed with the Section 2.)MetaMask is a plugin for Google Chrome browser. It can be downloaded and installed from metamask.ioStep 1: Go to https://metamask.io and click on GET CHROME EXTENSION.Step 2: Chrome web store will open in a new tab. Click on Add ExtensionStep 3: Click on +ADD TO CHROMEStep 4: Read the Terms of Use and click on Accept.Step 5: Enter a secure password twice and click on CREATE.Step 6: Copy the words that appeared on your screen and save them somewhere safe. Then click on I\u2019ve copied it somewhere safe.Step 7: A wallet named Account 1 will be created for you by default.ALTERNATIVE OPTION 3: MIST(Note: if you already have MyEtherWallet, you may skip this alternative option and proceed with the Section 2.)Step 1: Download the latest Mist release here (https://github.com/ethereum/mist/releases). For this tutorial we are using Ethereum Mist for Mac OS.Step 2: Click USE THE MAIN NETWORKStep 3: Click SKIP on \u201cDo you have wallet file\u201dStep 4: Pick a secure password and enter it twiceStep 5: Your Main Account address is here. Be sure to write it downStep 6: Click NEXT and wait for download.Step 7: Here is the account overview screen you will see once the download is complete, you can use SEND to send Ether. To receive the ether from other party, simply share the address from Step 5.You will need to provide this public address during your registration for the BitDegree token sale.You will need to provide this public address to transfer ETH to your wallet.Do not lose your password and the keystore file, as you will need to use them in the BitDegree token sale.2. GETTING ETH AND TRANSFERRING IT TO YOUR WALLETThere are a few ways to get Ether. We suggest using one of the following:-Purchasing by bank transfer,-Purchasing by Credit Card,-Exchanging Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency.We suggest using Cex.io or Kraken.com as their interface is really easy-to-use.NOTE: Kraken.com does not accept transfers from Credit Card.OPTION 1: Kraken.com (pay with bank transfer or crypto)PART 1 \u2014 Getting ETHStep 1: Create an account by entering your email, selecting a username and a secure password. Click on the black sign up box in the right corner:Step 2: You\u2019ll receive an email confirmation letter. Once your account is confirmed log in. Your screen should look similar to this:Step 3: Now you must verify your personal information. You can do that by clicking on Get verified.Step 4: Select the applicable Tier and verify your identity. It usually takes up to 2\u20133 days.Step 5: Once your account is verified, go to the Funding tab. Select your funding method from the left side and deposit the desired amount of selected currency.Step 6: Once your account is funded, select Trade and New Order to place orders. Note that the currency pair you select plays a role in determining what is bought. Select the BUY button and choose a currency pair x/y, then currency x will be bought and currency y sold.Step 7: Enter the desired amount and press Buy x with y.PART 2. Transferring ETH to your walletStep 1: Login to your account and go to Funding tab. Select Withdraw. Press on Ether (ETH).Step 2: Click on +Add address. Add a description and your Ether wallet address. Save it and click the Back button.Step 3: Select the address you just created from the dropdown. Enter the amount. \u2192Review Withdrawal \u2192 Confirm Withdrawal.Once the Initiated status changes to Success you can access your Ether wallet and see the balance.Alternative OPTION 2: Cex.io (pay with credit/debit cards, bank transfer or crypto)In this tutorial we will show how to exchange money from your credit/debit card. Making a bank transfer or exchanging a cryptocurrency process is similar.Part 1. Getting ETHStep 1: Go to Cex.io and press REGISTERStep 2: Sign up with your email and choose a secure password. You can use an alternative way from the column on the right:Step 3 : Select 2-step verification method to increase security.Step 4: Confirm your email.Step 5: Once you confirm your email you should see a screen similar to this one.

That\u2019s because Ethereum network supports smart contracts, which make ICO participation easier and more secure. It\u2019s relatively easy to get Ether on most of the cryptocurrency exchanges. At the moment, it\u2019s the second largest cryptocurrency with $45 billion market cap.Where to buy EthereumOver 7000 cryptocurrency markets are trading more than 1300 different cryptocurrencies. Some of the best sites to acquire Ether are:Coinbase (user-friendly, minimum deposit $1, via bank transfer or credit/debit card).Bitstamp (user-friendly, minimum deposit $5, via bank transfer or credit/debit card).GDAX (for more experienced investors, minimal deposit $1, via bank transfer).Gemini (for more experienced investors, minimal deposit $1, via bank transfer).Kraken (for more experienced investors, minimal deposit $5, via bank transfer).BitPanda (user-friendly, minimal deposit $25, via bank transfer and credit/debit card).eToro (user-friendly, minimal deposit $200, via bank transfer, credit/debit card or Paypal).LocalEthereum (for more experienced investors, minimal deposit $1, via bank transfer, Paypal or other cryptocurrencies).All the sites with user-friendly interface make it easy to buy Ether. All you need to do is find an exchange that you favor. Pay attention to their transaction fees, since usually, credit/debit card deposits can be unreasonably expensive, although much quicker than the bank transfers.Buying Ether is simple, but can take some time. Check this step-by-step tutorial by Coinbase. The process is similar in all exchanges.Purchasing Ether with BitstampIf you never bought cryptocurrencies before, please follow the steps below. Here, we\u2019ve chosen to open a Bitstamp account to guide you through the process.1. Go to www.bitstamp.net2. Create an account.3. After you click register, your login credentials will be sent to the specified email address. Use them to log in to the site.4. As soon as you log in, you\u2019ll be asked to change your password to new one. Include at least one upper and lowercase letter and number to make it more secure. After that, re-login using your new password. It\u2019s also recommended to enable two-factor authentication, but you can do that later on.5. If you click Buy / Sell option on the top header, you will be asked to verify your account. Depositing without verification is impossible. Click on \u201cverify your account\u201d to proceed.6. You\u2019ll be asked to choose between verifying a personal or corporate account. Select a personal one (unless you\u2019re a corporation) and fill in all the required details about yourself, including a copy of ID card, proof of residence and other documents. Make sure that the pictures you upload are high-quality; otherwise, the verification request will be denied.7. It might take a while, but if you followed all of the instructions, you should be verified within 30 minutes. Now we can make our first deposit and proceed to buy Ether.8. Choose \u201cDeposit\u201d from the main menu.9. On the right side, you will see many deposit options. If you want to buy Ether with fiat, choose between EU bank, International Bank or Credit Card options.10. Be mindful that different deposit methods come with different fees. For that, see Bitstamp fee schedule.11. Select your most suitable payment option, the amount you wish to deposit and make the transfer. Bank transfers usually take one day to complete. Credit card transfers happen almost immediately.12. Depending on your deposit method, you might have to wait for your money to arrive. Once your account is topped-up, pick the ETH/EUR trading option in the top-left corner.13. Head to Buy/Sell section and select \u201cBuy ETH\u201d, since it\u2019s the simplest purchase method.14. Enter the amount which you want to spend on ETH and click Buy. Your newly acquired Ether will be credited to your account immediately.15. Congratulations! Your first Ethereum purchase made simple.After you\u2019re done with purchasing Ethereum tokens, it is highly recommended to transfer your coins to a private ERC 20 Wallet. To transfer your Ether from Bitstamp, go to Withdraw section and select Ethereum (ETH). You\u2019ll see an easy to follow withdrawal window.Fill in your ERC20 Ethereum wallet address, select the amount and withdraw your Ether.P.S. You will also have to confirm it by email.How to exchange your Bitcoins to Ethereum?If you\u2019re already holding Bitcoin, you might find it handy to convert some of it to Ether to participate in the ICO. According to your situation, we put up several tools that might help.Do it on your currency exchangeIf you don\u2019t have ETH, but hold other coins like BTC or another altcoin, swapping your currencies into ETH is extremely easy. Most exchanges (Coinbase, Bitstamp, Gemini, etc.) will allow you to trade the BTC/ETH pair instantly and with little fees.Use ShapeShift.ioA lot of people choose to keep their Bitcoins or other coins off exchanges and rightfully so. That\u2019s why we decided to create this simple guide on how to change your Bitcoins (or altcoins) to Ether via inexpensive and straightforward service ShapeShift.io.Two things that you\u2019ll need before using ShapeShift to convert your Bitcoins or other coins to Ethereum are:1. A wallet with Bitcoins or altcoins.2. An ERC20 compatible Ethereum wallet. Check out our guide on how to get one.As soon as you have these in place, head to ShapeShift.io.1. The first thing to do is to select your deposit coin. It can be any coin that you hold in your wallet, but for the sake of this tutorial, we\u2019ll choose Bitcoin.2. Next, you\u2019ll need to select an asset to receive, which is Ether. Also, pick the precise option above the continue button. It helps you to get a better rate and indicates that you know precisely how much Bitcoin you\u2019re going to exchange. If you don\u2019t know yet, use the quick option. For a more in-depth explanation of the difference between the two, check the ShapeShift blog.3. Click continue and you will be taken to the following page.4. First, you have to enter how much Bitcoin you want to exchange for Ether. In this case, the amount is 0.1 BTC. Then, enter your Ether wallet address (destination) and Bitcoin wallet address in case the transaction fails. In such case, it will be safely returned there. Lastly, check \u201cI agree to Terms\u201d button and click Start Transaction.5. If you did everything correctly, you should see the similar window. Here you can see a Bitcoin wallet address where you need to send your Bitcoin to complete the transaction.6. You\u2019ll have 5 minutes to complete the transaction. Copy the wallet address under Send This Amount To field.7. Open your Bitcoin wallet and send the Bitcoins to the given address. If you\u2019ve selected \u201cprecise\u201d, make sure to enter the same amount as you specified.8. Soon after you send your Bitcoin, you should notice that the status bar has updated.9. Now, waiting is all is left. It will take ~30 minutes for your Ether to arrive in your wallet.10. When the transaction is completed, you\u2019ll see the status bar changing once again and the Ether should be in your wallet.Here you have it! You\u2019ve successfully converted your Bitcoins or other altcoins to Ethereum and can participate in ICO.If you like the service, it\u2019s worth noting that ShapeShift also has a convenient app for both Android and iOS.Use ChangellyIf for some reason, you prefer to avoid ShapeShift, an alternative way is to use Changelly. Changelly is another service that lets you turn your coins into other coins. It requires registration; therefore, it\u2019s slightly more convenient than Shapeshift if you\u2019re planning to use the service multiple times.Again, we\u2019ll be turning Bitcoins into Ether. To make it happen, make sure that you have set up an Ethereum wallet beforehand. If you don\u2019t have it yet, see our guide on how to open one.Go to www.changelly.com and select BTC (you have) and ETH (you get). Enter the amount of Bitcoin that you want to turn to Ether and click exchange.2. Changelly will ask you to open an account. Sign up as a new user to continue with your transaction.3. As soon as you sign up, you\u2019ll be taken to transaction window. Double check the amounts and click next.4. Enter your Ether\u2019s wallet address where you want to receive your freshly acquired Ether. Click next.5. Confirm the payment and hit make payment to proceed.6. On the next page, you\u2019ll see Bitcoins wallet address and QR code. Send the Bitcoins you wish to exchange there. Make sure to send the amount you specified before.7. That\u2019s it! You can close the window once you complete the payment. Once the transaction is completed, you\u2019ll get a notification to your email.Pro Tip: Since both Shapeshift.io and Changelly.com operate on a similar principle, it is handy to compare both services simultaneously to see which one offers a better deal for a specific transaction.What to do next?Once you get a grip on your Ether, it\u2019s time to make use of it. Again, if there are any uncertainties, see our other guide which helps you to create an ICO compatible Ether wallet and describes the ICO process.Also, keep an eye on your website for further updates.

Radically emergent models of fundamental physics hint at new ether physics, transcendent engineering, quantum/chaos magic, and tentative models of divine action.Current theories of fundamental physics seem to fail at small scales and high energies (two related concepts). This is often considered as a problem to solve. But we have probed nature only in a small range of scales. Why should our theories continue to work near zero length and infinite energy, which is infinitely far from the laboratory?In his 2006 book \u201cThe Trouble with Physics,\u201d a provocative look at current problems in theoretical physics, Lee Smolin praises emergent models of fundamental physics:\u201cThese are models developed by condensed-matter physicists, such as Robert Laughlin, of Stanford; Grigori Volovik, of the Helsinki University of Technology; and Xiao-Gang Wen, of MIT\u2026 These men are master craftsmen and seers both. Having done perhaps the best and most consequential normal science of the last few decades, they decided to try their hands at the deep problems of quantum gravity\u2026\u201dI have written some notes on the work of Volovik and Wen. In his 1998 Nobel Prize lecture, Laughlin defines an emergent phenomenon as a low-energy collective effect of huge numbers of particles that cannot be deduced from the microscopic equations of motion in a rigorous way and that disappears completely when the system is taken apart, and suggests that \u201cmost of the important outstanding problems in physics are emergent in nature, including particularly quantum gravity.\u201d See also Laughlin\u2019s book \u201cA Different Universe: Reinventing Physics from the Bottom Down\u201d (2006).Simple example: Phonons in metals are emergent in nature. Smolin explains that a phonon is not an elementary particle: \u201cIt is certainly not one of the particles that make up the metal, for it exists only by virtue of the collective motion of huge numbers of the particles that do make up the metal.\u201d\u201cBut a phonon is a particle just the same. It has all the properties of a particle. It has mass, it has momentum, it carries energy. It behaves precisely the way quantum mechanics says a particle should behave. We say that a phonon is an emergent particle.\u201dIn radically emergent models of fundamental physics, all known particles are emergent particles. All known fields, symmetries, and physical laws, including Einstein\u2019s relativity and quantum mechanics, emerge from new physics in an underlying substrate. Following Volovik and Wen, \u201cether\u201d seems an appropriate name for the fundamental substrate.I like these models because they are physical, permit reasoning by analogy with known material systems like superfluids that can be studied in the lab, and are flexible enough to leave room for spiritual and theological speculations.According to Einstein\u2019s special relativity, the speed of light in vacuum is the same for all inertial observers (Lorentz symmetry). But a Lorentz symmetry for the speed of sound can emerge in a superfluid, Wen explains, \u201cif the clock and ruler are [made] by low energy phonons.\u201dIn other words, inner observers in the superfluid would think that the speed of sound is a fundamental speed limit. But we know that the speed of light in our vacuum is much higher than the speed of sound in the superfluid. Similarly, influences in the ether might propagate much faster than the speed of light in our vacuum. The idea comes to mind that future ether engineering might permit faster-than-light communications and travel.Metric fields analogous to the gravitational field in empty space, which according to Einstein is the structure of our spacetime, emerge in condensed matter systems. Similarly, our space and time themselves might emerge from the physics of the ether, opening the way to spacetime engineering and time magic (time scanning, time travel and all that).Quantum mechanics itself might emerge from chaotic dynamical systems in the ether. The underlying dynamics would be nonlocal and causally open. In fact, even in classical (non-quantum) physics, the chaotic evolution of strongly fractal dynamical systems is causally open (undetermined in principle).Note: I am tentatively using \u201ccausally open\u201d instead of \u201cnondeterministic\u201d in light of an ongoing discussion on my previous essays (1, 2) with chaos theory pioneer Ralph Abraham.Using quantum-speak, the path of a dynamical system in a fractally \u201criddled\u201d region of its phase space can be considered as a superposition of different possible paths, which eventually undergoes a collapse (apparently random, with probabilities instead of certainty) to one specific path.This analogy suggest the possibility that quantum behavior could emerge from \u201cdeterministic\u201d mathematical equations for the underlying ether physics. But these mathematically deterministic equations would allow indeterminate, quantum-like behavior.The Planck scale and beyond, which is currently considered as a no-go zone for physics, could be accessible to new ether physics. The ether could be a continuum described by continuous mathematical models, with differential geometry extended to fractal geometry.Once the physics of chaos and nonlocality in the ether is better understood, quantum ether engineering might permit controlling fundamental chance and change.Life, mind and Mind in the ether and beyondWe are only aware of carbon-based life in the Earth\u2019s biosphere, but we can\u2019t assume that all forms of life in the universe must be similar to life as we know it. Surely nature is much more imaginative than that.Following the analysis in the privately circulated book \u201cXenology: An Introduction to the Scientific Study of Extraterrestrial Life, Intelligence, and Civilization\u201d (available online), by molecular nanotechnology pioneer Robert Freitas, Cl\u00e9ment Vidal analyzed possible metabolisms of living systems based on all four fundamental physical forces in his 2014 book \u201cThe beginning and the end: the meaning of life in a cosmological perspective.\u201dFollowing astrophysicist Fred Hoyle (in \u201cThe Black Cloud\u201d and related nonfiction), Freitas and Vidal speculate on living creatures operating on the principles of plasma physics rather than the usual molecular biochemistry. Super-exotic life forms based on non-electromagnetic interactions such as the strong nuclear force (quantum chromodynamics, QCD) could exist in high-energy environments such as neutron stars, and even more exotic life could exist in black holes.From here, another leap of imagination brings us to thinking of intelligent life based directly on the sub-quantum physics of the ether.There are speculations that the biological brain could be \u201cquantum matter\u201d and support the thinking and feeling mind through long-range quantum coherence. According to radically emergent models of fundamental physics, the ether also exhibits long-range coherent behavior.Recent research suggests that quantum fields (ether fields) could process information in mind-like ways. Since ether fields are much denser and faster than familiar forms of matter, we can think of the ether as ultra-high performance computronium and self-aware perceptronium.Therefore, we can imagine self-aware, intelligent life in the ether. Some of these beings could be super-intelligent, God-like Minds able to control the universe (divine action) through ultimate ether engineering and \u201cquantum/chaos magic.\u201dLet\u2019s go back to the possibility, mentioned above, that quantum behavior could emerge from \u201cdeterministic\u201d mathematical equations for the underlying ether physics. If so, how can the divine Minds, and smaller minds like you and I, make freely willed choices? Where do the apparently random inputs needed to actualize one of several possible outcomes come from?A possible answer is that, if the underlying mathematical laws are deterministic in the sense that they don\u2019t contain uncertain parts, free will and divine action can be thought of as emerging from inside in some way, as opposed to coming from outside.If so, there\u2019s no need to resort to mind/matter dualism. Monism is a viable philosophy, and there might be a self-consistent unified description of mind and matter.Another possibility is that freely willed choices really come from outside, which brings us straight into simulation hypothesis territory. Or, since it\u2019s really the same thing, traditional theology territory.Yet another possibility is an infinite regress. Beneath the ether there might be another ether, or the simulating reality might be a simulation itself, and so forth with turtles all the way down in an infinite fractal zoom. In this case, the origin of freely willed choices is pushed down to the infinitely far, unattainable bottom.In any case, I am persuaded that intelligent organic life forms like current humankind can learn much more and earn a place in the community of God-like Minds. If there is an absolute God, we\u2019ll become cosmic engineers in God\u2019s control room. If needed, we\u2019ll start exploring deeper turtles on the way down. Eventually, we\u2019ll re-engineer the universe and resurrect the dead, achieving the Cosmist vision of Nikolai Fedorov.I just found out that I have been quoted in an essay on Fedorov, published in Atlas Obscura, titled \u201cThe Russian Philosopher Who Sought Immortality in the Cosmos.\u201d\u201cIn particular, cosmism is open to the possibility that future science and technology might be able to resurrect the dead from the past, and to the idea that our universe might be, for want of a better word, a simulation,\u201d says Prisco. \u201cThese ideas are, like it or not, both compatible with science and totally indistinguishable from religion. Many Transhumanists, who tried to kick religion out through the back door of superstition, are now finding that religion is coming back to them through the main door of science.\u201dIn fact, the parallels between these ideas and traditional religions are clear and evident for those who want to see. My message is that, if you want to believe in the cosmological core of your religion without abandoning the scientific worldview, yes you can.Pictures from Wikimedia Commons (1, 2, 3).", "responses": 2, "tags": ["Quantum Physics", "Chaos Theory", "Emergence", "Divine Action", "Religion And Spirituality"]}, {"title": "", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@real_token/real-tokens-are-tradable-in-gatecoin-and-etherdelta-exchanges-c4f04926e1db?source=search_post", "author_name": "REAL", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@real_token", "publish_date": "2017-10-13", "last_modified_date": "2018-05-05", "readtime": "0.68", "claps": 127, "voters": 17, "content": "REALFollowOct 13, 2017 \u00b7 1 min readREAL Tokens are tradable in Gatecoin and Etherdelta ExchangesWe have good news for REAL contributors!!

At the time, many of us felt alienated by the lack of technical progress and toxic discourse that was developing within the Bitcoin community. It was clear that Bitcoin was (and still is) suffering from a failure to innovate and evolve.The passion for change and innovation that gave rise to the success of Bitcoin in the first place had been replaced by religious dogma, irrational infighting and complacency \u2014 effectively stagnating the project. I hope that the same fate does not happen in Ethereum. If the innovators that took the risks and developed Ethereum are attacked and penalized for technical experimentation, then we will drive the very builders that we rely on away and we will slow development considerably, potentially catching our own case of Bitcoin-esque stagnation.We should not forget the fact that Ethereum is still hardly into its beta phase. The original Ethereum roadmap includes multiple planned hard forks going forward up to the moment of Serenity. Until that time, we should prioritize development and evolution of the protocol.Everyone can feel free to be dogmatic about immutability after Serenity.I call for a return to these values as the guiding principles of our community and look to the leaders and major projects in the Ethereum community to support EIP867, EIP999, or some other equivalent measure, which would allow for unfreezing the considerable amount of ETH locked in frozen contracts via some recovery process. I also suggest that we commit a significant portion of the unfrozen funds towards necessary protocol-layer development and set forth a series of parameters for future decisions of this nature based on the lessons learned from this experience and The DAO before it.Debunking the Counter-Arguments to Unfreezing FundsThere are a series of common arguments used against EIP867, EIP999 or any other proposal around frozen ETH. The following is a review of the primary points:\u201cUnknown unknowns.\u201dThe most commonly cited argument I come across from members of the Ethereum technical community is that allowing for a procedure whereby funds are unfrozen could \u201copen a can of worms\u201d. While this isn\u2019t a technical argument without identifying specific attack vectors, it is a valid concern that any hard fork could have unforeseen consequences. However, I have to believe that we can limit negative byproducts by adequately testing any measure (whether it be a hard fork or not) in an appropriately incentivized testnet and by conducting multiple security audits. I propose that any smart contract shipped on the Ethereum mainnet going forward have demonstrably passed no less than 3 independent security audits from technical teams that are widely respected in the community.The other aspect of this line of concern is that many other requests for fund recovery will be generated if the ETH in question is unlocked. This argument overlooks the fact that there are many users with potentially legitimate cases for the recovery of lost funds at this moment and there will be more in the future.\u201cThis is just about helping Parity, who messed up\u201dThis is not about Parity. There are a lot of great infrastructure development teams working on building Ethereum and Web 3.0. We want them all to succeed. We also know that no matter how deeply we audit code and how laser-focused a team might be on security, vanguard technologies will present bugs and be subject to bumps along the development roadmap.It is true that nearly a third of all nodes are run on the Parity implementation, including many of the most complex smart contracts and decentralized applications. Arguably, there is not a single team that has contributed so much to protocol layer development of Ethereum software since day-one. While I personally believe that this community does owe Parity a certain debt of gratitude, solving this issue isn\u2019t about helping them. Parity (and Polkadot) will be just fine independent of this ETH because the parachain protocol they are building is very compelling for the entire industry and is appropriately funded.This is about the 587+ wallets containing frozen funds. This is about helping deserving teams like Moeda, who are building a cooperative banking system for developing nations, TapTrust, who are developing an open-source project meant to bring more trust and transparency to the token economy, and Musiconomi, a decentralized music project designed to empower artists and their fans. Many of these teams have limited runway and may not be able to complete development if the funds are not unfrozen within a reasonable timeframe. What kind of community denies users access to funds that are provably theirs? In the context of the oncoming competitive environment where Ethereum is no longer the only smart contract platform out there, how will these decisions affect future developer\u2019s allocation of resources?This is about a threat that faces anyone who wants to build on Ethereum. A recent study has proven what we already know, that many, many smart contracts deployed on Ethereum have vulnerabilities with 89% of those studied in detail offering real exploits. Many projects and individuals have lost money due to these trace vulnerabilities, and will in the future. This clearly shows that this is one of many problems with Solidity and we must continue to evolve, or be overtaken by another protocol that can deal with these issues effectively.I favour a properly orchestrated carbon vote, even if only to test the temperature of the community and evaluate whether or not the token holders are in favour of EIP867, EIP999 or some equivalent solution. Please note that the ad-hoc carbon vote that took place in April was limited only to MEW/MyCrypto wallets and did not have an appropriate communication phase nor deadline for voting and I do not feel that it appropriately represented the community.I understand Vitalik\u2019s view that stake-voting is nothing more than a plutocracy. I deeply respect his opinions and influential position in the Ethereum community, but would argue that evaluating the signals a carbon vote provides is better than a central authority making decisions based in large part on what the mob is shouting on social media. I observe that some form of governance and signal capture from the community is better than no governance.\u201cMy ETH is now worth more because of reduced supply\u201dI don\u2019t see how near term pricing is set by actual demand-supply dynamics in any way. Quantity Theory of Money or most other traditional macroeconomic constructs are currently not appropriately pricing token value (and may never appropriately price crypto assets). This should seem obvious considering the current beta of the underlying assets. There is far more noise from the irrational gyrations of the market than there is signal from underlying fundamental metrics around network usage or token velocity.Furthermore, the ETH in question is not an expressive enough component of the supply to truly matter in the context of total supply. It is myopic to believe that one benefits from someone else\u2019s misfortune in this case. It should be very clear that whether the ETH in question remain frozen or not has no actual bearing on the price of your Ether. In fact, because so much of the frozen ETH belongs to projects fully committed to building decentralized technologies, unlocking it may very well help grow the Ethereum network and in turn increase the long-term value of your ETH.Immutability and Other Dogmatic ConceptsThere is an argument that given the tumultuous events around previous forks (see The DAO \u00e0 Ethereum Classic) that we should not, under any circumstances, fork to return funds to any individual or group as to negatively affect Ethereum\u2019s reputation as not being an immutable chain.I would like to remind those in this camp that Ethereum is very much still in early stage development and this sort of dogma surrounding immutability severely disincentivizes innovators from taking otherwise reasonable risks to build the technology of the future.Those who praise complete immutability and resist fund recovery of any kind should also consider the fact that the ultimate vision we all have for blockchains is to create better, more secure and transparent systems than those we currently have in place. The reason many of these systems were built in the first place was to protect individual property rights. Wouldn\u2019t we rather be a part of a community that respects these sorts of natural laws whenever possible? How can we expect mainstream adoption of blockchains if we ignore this central facet of social consensus? We must have a balanced approach and remember that blockchains are being built by humans, for humans. Humans will make mistakes and code can\u2019t yet account for what is morally and ethically just.A Proposed Path ForwardThere are lessons to be learned from this experience and we must continue to develop best practices in the community. I offer a few proposals, but invite thoughtful feedback on how we could arrive at the best path forward:1. I call on any prominent projects in the ecosystem to manifest their opinion in favour or not for EIP867, EIP999 or any fund recovery solution. I am quite optimistic that those projects that are focused on solving difficult problems and building complex smart contracts are likely to signal a more forgiving approach because they actually understand the reality here \u2014 this is vanguard technology that is difficult to develop and more mistakes are inevitable during the maturation process.2. At the upcoming Ethereum Magicians Summit in Berlin let\u2019s bring together leading minds in security and try to formalize an updated fund recovery proposal. (EIP867, EIP999 or similar) and ensure that attack vectors are identified, debated and protected against. If we arrive at a reasonable solution, then this could be part of the Constantinople update/fork later in the year.We should also set forth a set of standards for evaluating proposals of this nature going forward.3. I suggest that we hold a well orchestrated carbon vote in order to test the temperature of the community.It is reasonable and fair that we evaluate what the token holders think should be done in this case. As mentioned, previous carbon votes were limited in scope and communication and did not properly reflect community sentiment. Any address and/or wallet should be able to participate.4. As a community, we must work together on improving and establishing best practices for ensuring security. Robust auditing is a start, but will not catch every bug in innovative new systems. Rather than relying on audits to protect against reputational risk in the event that a bug is found and exploited, we must work to develop real security on the Ethereum network, and be transparent about what measures we take to ensure that security for users.5. Any time we need to unfreeze ETH from an address and it is clear that this was done through a self-destructed contract or other known issue, a reasonable portion (\u2153\u2013\u00bd) of the ETH in question must be immediately pledged to protocol-layer development. This can be via a donation to the Ethereum Foundation, Giveth, The Ethereum Community Fund or a set initiatives by a different group as long as it is approved through the Ethereum Foundation or any delegated authority therein. My friend Fred Ersham has deftly highlighted the lack of protocol-layer development happening in Ethereum in his post on funding the evolution of blockchains, so this measure alone clearly provides enough benefit to make this a positive outcome. Further incentivization will be important, especially considering that competing chains will soon offer very compelling financial rewards to low-level developers with the talent to make protocol-layer improvements.There is a great war for developer mindshare coming. Ethereum no longer exists in a vacuum and the healthy lead Ethereum enjoys can quickly be lost if we are seen as a difficult community to collaborate with and build new, innovative technologies in. If we stop pushing Ethereum forward and improving the experience for developers and in turn apply unnecessarily draconian penalties for the errors innovators make at this early juncture and drive them away, then it is Ethereum that will lose in the end.-Ryan Zurrer", "responses": 3, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Cryptocurrency", "Smart Contracts", "Security", "Eth"]}, {"title": "Ether is more halal than Bitcoin", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@virgilgr/eth-more-halal-than-btc-c2a2ee2d8d3d?source=search_post", "author_name": "Virgil Griffith", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@virgilgr", "publish_date": "2017-10-13", "last_modified_date": "2018-04-09", "readtime": "4.16", "claps": 190, "voters": 27, "content": "Ether is more halal than BitcoinVirgil GriffithFollowOct 13, 2017 \u00b7 5 min readI\u2019ve recently been learning about financial infrastructure, and I was browsing the extra requirements in Islamic finance. This led me to the requirements an Islamic currency must satisfy. In answering this question, I saw an article discussing whether Bitcoin is Sharia compliant citing conservative philosopher Imran Hosein. And for good reason \u2014 Hosein is one of the clearest and most cited thinkers in Islamic finance, and his paper, The Gold Dinar and the Silver Dirham: Islam and the Future of Money (2007), gives six necessary properties for \u201cmoney\u201d within a fully Sharia-compliant economy. These are:(1) Money functions as a medium of exchange.(2) Money is durable and does not spoil or corrode.(3) Money is either a precious metal or food.Technically, this can also be any \u201cregularly consumed commodity.\u201d Additionally, this one seems flexible as long as (6) is well-satisfied. More liberal Islamic scholars opine that it is sufficient for your currency can be readily exchanged for gold/silver.(4) Money exists in creation and is made valuable by Allah.(5) Money is abundant and freely available.(6) Money has intrinsic value.There must be value \u201cinside\u201d the money, not just \u201coutside\u201d.We examine these in turn and see how well Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) satisfies every condition.1. Money functions as a medium of exchange. \u2705 \u2705As evidence from the many currency exchanges, both Bitcoin and Ether satisfy this easily.2. Money is durable and does not spoil or corrode. \u2705 \u2705Living on a digital ledger, both Bitcoin and Ether satisfy this with flying colors.3. Money is either a precious metal or food. \u2705 \u2705The liberal interpretation is that it is sufficient for there to merely be an exchange rate between the given currency and gold. And both Bitcoin and Ether satisfy this by there being a conversion between BTC \u2194 USD \u2194 Gold and ETH \u2194 USD \u2194 Gold. Both good here. The more conservative interpretation is that this is a restatement of the \u201cintrinsic value\u201d criterion. A useful comparison here is to tradable mobile phone minutes, which are 100% accepted even by the Saudis.4. Money exists in creation and is made valuable by Allah. \u2705 \u2705A Pakistani banking colleague of mine tells me that to \u201cexist in creation\u201d, is usually interpreted to mean that ownership of the asset is unambiguous. As the ownership of BTC/ETH is determined by the private key, there\u2019s no problems here.For \u201cmade valuable by Allah\u201d, it\u2019s been argued that it is sufficient for the commodity\u2019s price to set by the market instead of by some external issuer. The value of BTC/ETH are both determined by numerous exchanges. So all good.5. Money is abundant and freely available. \u2705 \u2705BTC and ETH are both widely accessible via exchanges. As for being \u201cabundant\u201d, I suppose that even though Bitcoin has a fixed cap on the number of coins, people will always be able to own one Satoshi of BTC (1 BTC = 10\u2078 Satoshi). Ether is always minting new coins, and likewise it will always be possible to own one Wei of ETH (1 ETH = 10\u00b9\u2078 Wei). No problems here.6. Money has intrinsic value. \u274c \u2705This one is the differentiator. Bitcoin has no intrinsic value. Some have argued that Bitcoin\u2019s \u201cproof of work\u201d gives it value, but it\u2019s unclear to me how running on a treadmill increases the value of any excreted sweat. (Under this same reasoning, people would be able to successfully commodify proof of dumbbell lifts, but no society accepts this.) Bitcoin is merely a medium of exchange. On the other hand, Ether has the intrinsic value of powering diverse programs. Ether is closer to oil or cellphone minutes in that it is readily consumed for a purpose unrelated to its use as a currency. This analogy to cellphone minutes puts Ether on much higher ground when it comes to being halal-compliant.CommentaryTo my pleasant surprise, many Bitcoiners agree with this assessment. In fact, a very pro-bitcoin source cites although Bitcoin is not explicitly haram, it \u201cfalls short of the strict and narrow definition of money in Islam\u201d, under the justification:\u201cHistorically, though, Islam has only recognized commodities of intrinsic value as money including things like gold (Dinar), silver (Dirham); rice, dates, wheat, barley and salt. In a strict interpretation of what qualifies as money, Bitcoin probably misses the mark.\u201dI couldn\u2019t agree more. The Bitcoiners have Bitcoin Jesus, but Muhammad (pbuh) is an Etherian.UpdatesI\u2019ve seen it claimed that because Bitcoin executes short scripts, BTC has intrinsic value in computation unrelated to the currency (just like Ethereum). I am skeptical of this because Bitcoin\u2019s Script code is simply to determine whether a given user is permitted to spend a certain transaction output. I\u2019m skeptical that this constitutes intrinsic value unrelated to use as a currency.Another claim I\u2019ve seen is that because groups like Factom use the Bitcoin ledger as a database, the Bitcoin system itself has intrinsic value unrelated to its use as a currency. On the face of it, this sounds reasonable. And I suppose this would be equivalent to my taking out all the bills in my wallet and carefully penning a JSON file stretching across all the bills. Okay\u2026 sure, those specific bills now have intrinsic value to those who care about my JSON file. And if the Bitcoin ledger was designed for scribbling JSON files onto it, or if JSON scribbling was incredibly common, I\u2019d accept this argument.But this isn\u2019t the case. The Bitcoin Core team explicitly discourages using the Bitcoin ledger in these non-standard ways. And as far as frequency, >98% of transactions don\u2019t use the fancy OP_RETURN magic used by Factom and others. Taken together, I stand by the claim that, BTC as a whole, lacks the \u201cintrinsic value\u201d property demanded by Hosein.One can argue that Ether is unlike cellphone minutes because when Ether is used to power a contract, the Ether is not \u201cconsumed\u201d by the computation, but merely transferred to a miner/validator that performed the computation. This is true. I suppose I would argue that, given that pretty much anyone on earth can process your computation, it doesn\u2019t really matter that there must to be someone on the other side to actually perform the computation. If there was a cabal attempting to prevent you from using your Ether, anyone else in the world (including yourself!) can come along and process your transaction.

Each year, Worldbuilders does a huge end-of-year fundraiser.

Transaction is used when we wish to modify or update the state stored in the Ethereum network.In this article, we will first provide some basic concepts on Ethereum. This builds the necessary groundwork for the upcoming parts. We then examine the structure of a generic Ethereum transaction. And after that, we are ready to explore the three types of transactions, each for different purposes, using the Ethereum transaction.Some Basic Concepts on Accounts and ContractsEthereum is an account-based blockchain implementation. There are two types of account: Externally-Owned Account and Contract Account. We will introduce them in a logical way.Externally-Owned Account (EOA)We can first consider EOA as individual user in the external world. A user in Ethereum network is represented by a 20-byte (160-bit) address. The representation is done through the holding of a private key that finally derives the 20-byte address.Within an Ethereum network circulates a native currency: ether. Besides a native currency, ether is mainly used as the transaction fee or service charge (called gas in Ethereum) when Ethereum network is processing the transaction. Each EOA holds an amount of ether as its state. When an EOA initiates a transaction, gas is specified and then spent in the Ethereum network. We will keep seeing gas elements when we deep dive into the transaction part.ContractBefore we go into Contract Account, let\u2019s have a glimpse on Contract first.Contract is the \u201csmart contract\u201d capability in Ethereum network, where the business logic is implemented. The contract begins as a human-understandable coding language (Solidity is the most common one in Ethereum). This code is compiled into machine-understandable code, called bytecode, which is to be deployed on an Ethereum network.Inside the contract code there are functions. These functions define the actual business logic, and will be called and executed once \u201cinvoked\u201d after the contract is deployed.We are going to use a sample contract called SimpleStorage in this article for demonstration.Contract AccountThe bytecode mentioned before is not yet accessible until it is deployed on an Ethereum network. The deployment of a contract bytecode is done through a transaction (we will examine this later). A Contract Account is created corresponding to a deployed contract.The Contract Account is identified by a Contract Address, again a 20-byte address. This is the address when we interact with this deployed account. Like any EOA, Contract Account can also keep ethers when appropriate to the business logic.Items OmittedAs this article is mainly on transaction, we omit some important concepts about Ethereum itself, like the peer-to-peer communication and mining. We assume transaction is properly propagated in Ethereum network, successfully mined, and is then included into a new block.Tools to be UsedHere are some tools I use here for demonstrating the Ethereum transactions.Any compiler works fine. Here I use REMIX, an online IDE tool for Ethereum contract. I only take out the bytecode of a sample contract.An Ethereum simulator is also used. This speeds up the process of setting up a private network and transactions are mined almost immediately. Here I am using Ganache-CLI.To interact with the Ethereum network, I use Go Ethereum client (geth) to access the Ethereum simulator.Ethereum TransactionWhile transactions are used for different purposes, the transaction structure is the same. We will first explore what is inside.Transaction StructureFrom: The transaction sender. It is a 20-byte address representing the account initiating this transaction.To: The recipient of this transaction. It is also a 20-byte address. Depends on the use, it can be another EOA, a Contract Account, or just left empty.Value: The amount of fund in wei (1 ether = 10\u00b9\u2078 weis) to be transferred from \u201cFrom\u201d to \u201cTo\u201d. If \u201cTo\u201d is an EOA, it is simply a fund transfer. If \u201cTo\u201d is a Contract Address, it is the amount of fund passed to the deployed contract. The contract is coded such that it can accept fund.Data/Input: This data field is mainly for contract related activities. For new deployment of contract it is the bytecode and the encoded arguments. For execution of contract function, it contains the function signature and the encoded arguments. It is left empty in fund transfer.Gas Price and Gas Limit: Both are related to the cost processing this transaction. Each processing step of a transaction performed by the miner has a predefined gas unit (for example, \u201csload\u201d which gets data from permanent storage costs you 20 gas units). Gas Price is the amount (in wei) per gas unit. This is the unit price transaction sender willing to pay. Gas Limit is the maximum gas units spent for this transaction. The maximum gas unit spent by your transaction will not exceed the Gas Limit, as a protection in case any discrepancy in transaction processing.Signing a TransactionAs we are using geth, this Ethereum client will handle the signing process on one\u2019s behalf. \u201cSigning\u201d a transaction object is the process of generating a signature on it using the private key of transaction sender. The signed transaction is then handled by geth for all the following steps until the signed transaction is being included in a newly mined block.Sending Transaction using GethThere are two ways to send transactions through the RPC: eth_sendTransaction and eth_sendRawTransaction, corresponding to the command we can use in Geth: eth.sendTransaction() and eth.sendRawTransaction().eth.sendTransaction(): This is for sending a transaction object. Geth will help signing the transaction (assuming geth has control on the private key) and perform all the serialization before sending this to the Ethereum network.eth.sendRawTransaction(): This is for sending a serialized signed transaction, which is composed according to the required structure. This is usually used when the private key is not handled locally in geth, and the signing is done outside the Geth client.For sake of simplicity, we are using eth.sendTransaction() for this whole article.Three Types of TransactionThe generic transaction mentioned above is used for the three different purposes.Fund Transfer Between EOADeploy a Contract on Ethereum NetworkExecute a Function on a Deployed ContractFund Transfer Between EOAThis transaction is used when an EOA is transferring fund to another EOA.The transaction looks like this.In this demonstration, we are transferring 10 ethers from accounts[0] to accounts[1].Note:Here we are using web3.fromWei and web3.toWei to convert between ether and wei for sake of demonstration. Bear in mind that the value in transaction is always in wei.Some gas is spent when sending this transaction from accounts[0]. The balance of accounts[0] is a bit less than 90 ethers. The difference is the gas spent for handling this transaction.Deploy a Contract on Ethereum NetworkIn this part we will deploy a compiled contract (i.e. the bytecode) on an Ethereum network. In Ethereum the deployment of contract is done through a transaction.The transaction looks like this.Here we are using the SimpleStorage contract. The contract looks like this.pragma solidity ^0.4.0;contract SimpleStorage {uint storedData;function set(uint x) public {  storedData = x;}function get() constant public returns (uint retVal) {  return storedData;}}And the bytecode is here (obtain the bytecode from Remix).\"608060405234801561001057600080fd5b5060df8061001f6000396000f3006080604052600436106049576000357c0100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000900463ffffffff16806360fe47b114604e5780636d4ce63c146078575b600080fd5b348015605957600080fd5b5060766004803603810190808035906020019092919050505060a0565b005b348015608357600080fd5b50608a60aa565b6040518082815260200191505060405180910390f35b8060008190555050565b600080549050905600a165627a7a7230582080122bb351e6e2c021f1c56c0c5933087e762ea6e7a3360b902b39cbed5a38f10029\"Here is how the transaction looks like.As usual, we see a transaction hash is returned. With this transaction hash we can examine the transaction detail using eth. getTransaction() and eth.getTransactionReceipt().Here we seeIn the transaction, the to is left empty (\u20180x0\u2019 is shown).In the input, we only place the bytecode. It is because our SimpleStorage contract does not have a constructor that requires arguments. If arguments are needed in constructor, they are encoded according to the type and appended after the bytecode. We will see how the encoding is done when we call set() function in the next part.The Contract Address is found in Transaction Receipt. We will use it in the next part.The default Gas Limit (gas) is 90,000 gas. If you do not specify the gas, you will encounter \u201cout of gas\u201d as it takes more than 90,000 gas for processing this transaction. Therefore we specify 200,000 gas for this transaction.It turns out the transaction processing only takes 112,213 gas. The remain is returned to transaction sender.Execute a Function on a Deployed ContractAfter a contract is deployed, an EOA can execute functions defined in this contract. Again it is implemented by sending an Ethereum transaction.Before we perform the sendTransaction() for executing a function defined in the contract, let\u2019s review the mechanism how to identify the function.In the Solidity code above, two functions are defined: get() and set(uint). When contract code is compiled, these functions are processed through a hashing function (keccak256, implemented as sha3 in web3 library) and the first four bytes are taken out as the function selectors.Here is how we extract the function selection from these two functions.So the function selector is0x6d4ce63c for get()0x60fe47b1 for set(uint256)We see these function selectors are already inside the bytecode.\"608060405234801561001057600080fd5b5060df8061001f6000396000f3006080604052600436106049576000357c0100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000900463ffffffff16806360fe47b114604e5780636d4ce63c146078575b600080fd5b348015605957600080fd5b5060766004803603810190808035906020019092919050505060a0565b005b348015608357600080fd5b50608a60aa565b6040518082815260200191505060405180910390f35b8060008190555050565b600080549050905600a165627a7a7230582080122bb351e6e2c021f1c56c0c5933087e762ea6e7a3360b902b39cbed5a38f10029\"Next, we need to understand the mechanism to execute the functions. These two functions are handled differently.We see constant (or view) added when we define get(). It allows query of state variable without sending a transaction (and therefore no gas is spent). In this case we are using eth.call(). It is similar to eth.sendTransaction() except that some parameters are now optional. We will continue using eth.sendTransaction() for set(uint) function. They are shown in the demonstration.In both cases, the data field contains the function selector and the encoded arguments if needed. Here is the transaction structure.So first, let\u2019s take a look on the existing value.\u201c0x6d4ce63c\u201d is the selector of get(). Since it is a constant (view) function, we use eth.call(). This does not create new transaction and the result can be returned immediately. The current value is zero.Then we will execute the set(uint). As it requires uint256 (the default type for uint), the data is now the selector plus the string for the value.And we check the value again using get(), and the value is updated.Note that eth.call() does not create a transaction. Only eth.sendTransaction() has a transaction hash returned.If we take a look on the transaction and the receipt of the transaction, we see the data being sent in the transaction, and the actual gas being spent for this transaction.SummaryIn this article we have examined the three types of most common interaction with Ethereum network: sending ethers among accounts, deploying a contract and executing contract functions. All of them can be done through sending transaction to Ethereum network, with proper construction of transaction parameters inside.This is not the only way to handle contract deployment and function execution, as we can also use eth.contract() and Application Binary Interface (abi) doing similar job. Nevertheless, using eth.sendTransaction() helps us understand the mechanism behind.Click to read today\u2019s top story", "responses": 2, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Smart Contracts", "Transactions", "Blockchain", "Tutorial"]}, {"title": "EtherCamp\u2019s Hacker Gold (HKG) public code audit", "post_link": "https://medium.com/zeppelin-blog/ethercamps-hacker-gold-hkg-public-code-audit-b7dd3a2fe43b?source=search_post", "author_name": "Manuel Araoz", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@maraoz", "publish_date": "2016-10-17", "last_modified_date": "2019-02-13", "readtime": "3.94", "claps": 28, "voters": 25, "content": "EtherCamp\u2019s Hacker Gold (HKG) public code auditManuel AraozFollowOct 17, 2016 \u00b7 4 min readWe\u2019ve been asked by our friends at ether.camp to review the code for their soon-to-launch Hacker Gold (HKG) token, and to publish the results of our work.The audited contract can be found in the hkg-tests branch of their GitHub repo, specifically, commit 2529ffe5efd5294b44f1bc89dc9a4721a7b16409. Main contract file is HackerGold.sol.Here\u2019s our assessment and recommendations, in order of importance:SevereWe have not found any severe security problems with the code.Potential problemsTimestamp usageWe verified that the timestamp list included in the HackerGold constructor correspond to the times stated in comments, and they check.That said, there\u2019s a problem with using timestamps and now (alias for block.timestamp) for contract logic, based on the fact that miners can perform some manipulation. In general, it\u2019s better not to rely on timestamps for contract logic. The solutions is to use block.number instead, and approximate dates with expected block heights.Given the nature of the contract, we think the risk of miner manipulation is really low. The potential damage is also limited: miners could only slightly manipulate price of HKG near the times where it changes (p1, p2, etc.). We recommend the EtherCamp team to consider the potential risk and switch to block.number if necessary.For more info on this topic, see this stack exchange question.Use safe mathThere are many unchecked math operations in the code. We couldn\u2019t find any related attack vectors on the HKG contract, but it\u2019s always better to be safe and perform checked operations. Consider using a safe math library, or performing pre-condition checks on any math operation.The fact that HKG supply is limited to 4,000,000 ether (and thus at most 800,000,000 HKG assuming all tokens are created at the best possible price) helps prevent possible overflows.Be careful with small transactionsToken calculation at line 90 of HackerGold.sol uses an integer division by 1,000,000,000,000,000, which truncates the result to an integer value. Any call to the function createHKG with a msg.value less than 0.001 ether will be lost, resulting in a 0 token balance. Note that the value of 0.0005 ether in theory corresponds to 0.1 HKG, which is a valid representation (less than 3 decimals), but in this case it is considered zero HKG.Moreover, any amount of ether after the 3rd decimal place will be ignored. If 0.12345678 ether is sent to createHKG, only 24.6 HKG will be created and assigned to the msg.sender.Consider changing that line to:uint tokens = msg.value * getPrice() / 1000000000000000;This yields 24.691 HKG for the previous example, which is better, but still ignores some small amounts. Consider warning users against sending amounts smaller than 0.001 ether.Also, consider changing the math operations to checked operations, as mentioned in the previous point.EDIT: EtherCamp fixed this problem in this commit.Price function checkWe wrote a small test script to calculate price evolution in time, and check the intended result. We realized that the milestone (p1, p2, etc.) transitions are correct, but the price curve may not be exactly as intended, again, due to integer division.Here\u2019s the intended price curve, from the HackerGold crowdsale page:HackerGold (HKG) intended price curve. Note that the curve shows the price of 1000 HKG tokens with respect to time.The price curve I reproduced is roughly the same, but instead of the continuous straight lines, we can see a stepped increase in price:Consider reordering arithmetic operations in getPrice to achieve a smoother price curve.You can find the tester code here.WarningsUsage of magic constantsThere are several magic constants in the contract code. Some examples are:https://github.com/ether-camp/virtual-accelerator/blob/2529ffe5efd5294b44f1bc89dc9a4721a7b16409/contracts/HackerGold.sol#L88-L90https://github.com/ether-camp/virtual-accelerator/blob/2529ffe5efd5294b44f1bc89dc9a4721a7b16409/contracts/HackerGold.sol#L116-L133Use of magic constants reduces code readability and makes it harder to understand code intention. We recommend extracting magic constants into contract constants.EDIT: EtherCamp fixed this problem in this commit.Remove unnecessary codeThe uint totalValue variable may be unnecessary. Consider using wallet.balance in its place unless funds in the multisig address will be moved (and thus balance changed) before p6. Having unneeded extra variables and code increases risk and attack surface for contract\u2019s invariants to be broken.Additional Information and notesThere are several typos in the comment for the allowance function in TokenInterface.sol. See: mouch, permited (twice). EDIT: EtherCamp fixed this problem in this commit.Use of send is always risky and should be analyzed in detail. Only one occurrence found in line 96 of HackerGold.sol.- Always check send return value: OK.- Always call send at the end of the function: OK.- Favor pull payments over push payments: Warning. No problems with push payment used, because wallet will be controlled by EtherCamp. Bear in mind that if that send fails for any reason, the whole createHKG call will fail.ConclusionsNo severe security issues were found. Some changes were recommended to follow best practices and reduce potential attack surface.Note: EtherCamp followed our recommendations and fixed the code, as you can see in their GitHub repo.Note that as of the date of publishing, the above review reflects the current understanding of known security patterns as they relate to HKG token contract. We have not reviewed the related Virtual Accelerator project. The above should not be construed as investment advice or an offering of HKG.

Welcome to the Ethereum domain auctions, which are little more than halfway finished.Like many others, I believe Ethereum \u2014 a programmable cryptocurrency that can be harnessed to write smart contracts that do everything from clear and trade securities, automatically pay your bills, sell property, share or protect data, or control anything that can respond to code \u2014 is going to become effectively the operating system of money. Bitcoin may have pointed the way to the future, but Ethereum will be the foundation. And right now the computer scientists and programmers who are developing Ethereum are auctioning off its domain naming rights. Just as having the right .com address can be worth big bucks, the thought is, so will be having the right .eth address. The great landgrab has started, and I\u2019ve been busy bidding.I don\u2019t want to get into all the mechanics of the auctions other than to say that it is an arcane, difficult process intended to assure fairness. Unfortunately, it also is a messy, jury-rigged sealed bid process that unintentionally keeps the normals away. Only a few thousand different accounts (and a person could have multiple accounts \u2014 I, for instance, use two) have signed up for the bidding, but the landscape has been dominated by just a few.Since transactions on the Ethereum blockchain are public, with a little research you can learn every detail of the bids. In most cases, you also can unveil a lot about the bidders themselves. At 60% of the way through the auction process and with 125,000 names already auctioned, here is a tour of some of the biggest players and their stats. All $ statistics were calculated with Ether = $260. (Editor\u2019s note \u2014 it has since moved up to $334 in just two days since I wrote this. The feeding frenzy is on! Jack up all quoted prices in $s accordingly.)========================================#1 \u201cThe O.G.\u201d31 Domains Purchased$10,324,860 Committed ETH (in $s)$47,706,137 \u201cDry Powder\u201d remaining in WalletMost Expensive 5 Domains: darkmarket; openmarket; tickets; payment; messengerThe O.G. is simply the biggest whale there is \u2014 he NEVER loses on a bid, because he is willing to make incomprehensibly huge blind bids to assure himself of winning. Why the name \u201cO.G.\u201d? Because he is one of the original gangsters in Ethereum. He was there at the genesis, undoubtedly one of the founding programmers who picked up a boatload of Ether when it was valued in pennies, not the $260 per token it is today. And the O.G. isn\u2019t only into Ethereum \u2014 he has converted his ether into other new crypto-tokens like Golem. How overpowering is his bidding? Well, he bid 58,887 ether \u2014 over $15 million \u2014 for the rights to remittance. Next best bid \u2014 1.23 Ether. He overwhelms the opposition.Just as the original bitcoiners often are fervent libertarians, the O.G. seems intrigued by not only the standard big money terms and concepts (besides payment, messenger, tickets, he also owns stockexchange, investor, digital-currency, remittance, swissfranc), but also the unsupervised, Wild West aspect of cryptocurrency. Hence the owning of darkmarket, silkroad, assassin, and most intriguingly to me, shadowbrokers, the name of the group which leaked malware hacked from the NSA last summer.========================================#2 \u201cThe Chinese Student Hacker\u201d144 Domains Purchased$4,895,300 Committed ETH (in $s)$383,031 \u201cDry Powder\u201d remaining in WalletMost Expensive 5 Domains: network; wallet; gambling; contracts; lendingWhy do I suspect this bidder to be a Chinese student? Well, just as you can tell a lot by a person by perusing their books and record collection, I\u2019m looking at the names he\u2019s bought. Student? He\u2019s picked up university, science, college, teaching, universitystudy; and waterloo, as in the University of Waterloo, renowned for its CS program and next door to Toronto, which is Ground Zero for where Ethereum was developed.Chinese-related words include caijing, zhongchau, qingdao, ethchina, chinese, as well as some lucky and unlucky numbers. One of the domains he owns is pornhub, for which he outbid 70 others. Another domain he owns also is the handle of his twitter account; he\u2019s never tweeted on it, and only two people follow him, but his account follows 50 other Twitter accounts \u2014 the majority of which are\u2026wait for it\u2026 Chinese porn. And he clearly is involved in cryptocurrency mining. He also appears to be a miner (he does own bitminer and hackers, and \u201cminer\u201d is the pseudonym shown on his Twitter account), and like some of the others here, he was involved in the very first bitcoin \u201cGenesis\u201d block.========================================#3 \u201cThe LA Lawyer\u201d108 Domains Purchased$2,640,560 Committed ETH (in $s)$2,536,867 \u201cDry Powder\u201d remaining in WalletMost Expensive 5 Domains: insurance, banking, currency, entertainment, bettingDo you know anyone who plays for bigger stakes and is more opportunistic than a class actions lawyer? Well, that\u2019s what our next player is, as the managing partner of a law firm specializing in class actions and\u2026yes, virtual currencies. While clearly a hard-nosed businessman, the Lawyer also is ethical, as seen through his writings about cyber-squatting and his refusal to go after such names. Rather than squat on corporate names like \u201cStarbucks\u201d for greenmail, he has spent big for the best set of non-trademarked domain names imaginable for smart contracts using Ethereum: insurance, banking, betting, etc. His LA roots show through (entertainment), as does his firm\u2019s involvement in real estate (mortgage, realestate, apartment). Nonetheless, his portfolio of domain names is varied, from alcohol to careers to testing to ratings to etherpay. While very establishment, he definitely has a mistrust for all things government, owning disruptwashington, verified, fakenews, encrypted, trustedsources, and nottrusted. It\u2019s strange that even with his combination of sophistication and distrust that his identity is so easily revealed: he bought up all of his family\u2019s names as domains and keeps them in the same digital wallet as all of his other activity. Jeffrey, tighten it up next time! While the Lawyer has won some incredible domains and has a whopping big bankroll, he, like everyone else, didn\u2019t stand a chance when he went up against the O.G. bidding for tickets and payment.========================================# 4 \u201cThe Gambler\u201d17 Domains Purchased$1,755,260 Committed ETH (in $s)$1,698,447 \u201cDry Powder\u201d remaining in WalletMost Expensive 5 Domains: blackjack; affiliate; 88888888; onlinepoker; mycasinoThis guy is a specialist: he\u2019s selective with his names, and almost all apply to gamblers or lucky numbers.========================================#5 \u201c2Bids\u201d1 Domain Purchased$1,731,600 Committed ETH (in $s)$9,465,731 \u201cDry Powder\u201d remaining in WalletOnly Domain: exchangeUnder the Vickrey auction rules used in the Ethereum domain auctions, it is the runner-up bid, also known as the cover bid, that establishes the price that is paid by the winner. So, if you bid 12 on something and I am the next best bidder at 7, once the auction is done, you are refunded the difference between 12 and 7, and 7 becomes the effective price. 2Bids has only bid twice: losing out to The Gambler on blackjack, and then overwhelmingly winning on exchange, bidding initially $3.3 million before the price settled at the cover bid of $1.73 million. He is sitting on the biggest stack around other than the O.G. In the meantime, while waiting for the next name he wants to come up for auction, 2Bids has, for him, a casual small $260,000 sidebet on an ambitious new cryptocurrency project, Aragon. Expect more fireworks from him later when the prime 4- and 5-letter names are auctioned. ========================================#6 \u201cThe CoFounder\u201dThis auction bidder is easy to guess\u2014 it must be Gavin Wood, the co-founder (along with Vitalik Buterin) of Ethereum. Gavin has registered few, but quality, names. It is safe to say that he owns much more Ether than he is showing in the wallet used below, and more than enough to make sure he beat out squatters bidding on gavinwood.eth. It\u2019s nice to see that his attention is based on building things of more lasting value than just amassing a collection of .eth domain names.7 Domains Purchased$664,300 Committed ETH (in $s)$253,678 \u201cDry Powder\u201d remaining in WalletMost Expensive 5 Domains: capital; property; crowdfund; tokensale; gavinwoodThe real question is, \u201cwhat kind of person would bid against someone like Gavin looking to acquire their own name?\u201d In this particular case, the answer is a scummy squatter like this jerk, who while only having 5 Ether to spend, has registered 99 names, squatting on various derivations and misspellings of JPMorganChase, Samsung, Verizon, Hewlett-Packard, Comcast, Walmart, Coca-Cola and any big company which he thinks he can extort. As well as high-profile personalities.========================================#7 \u201cMr. Identity\u201d10 Domains Purchased$490,100 Committed ETH (in $s)$18,201 \u201cDry Powder\u201d remaining in WalletMost Expensive 5 Domains: identity; dropbox; ycombinator; huffingtonpost; manulife90% of the money spent by this bidder is on one domain: identity.eth. Indeed, the concept of a secure, verified, yet encrypted identity information is almost a holy grail of developers. The goal is verifying and storing all of your info in the blockchain, whether that be your medical records, financial information or Social Security Number, and keeping that data private and encrypted except when you specifically choose to release it. As for the other domain names owned, there seems to be a hint of Silicon Valley unicorn here (ycombinator, and one of its most successful graduates, dropbox), but little else to go on. It is fitting that someone who is bidding on identity is protective enough of their own to have little information discernible.========================================#8 \u201cThe Chinese Dev Shop\u201d2 Domains Purchased$364,260 Committed ETH (in $s)$303,218 \u201cDry Powder\u201d remaining in WalletMost Expensive Domains: imtoken; consenlabsThis bidder holds just 2 names: imtoken and consenlabs. Both of those names can be found on this one website, if you can translate from the Chinese. Consen Labs is out of Hangzhou, and is a dev shop that previously worked on Ruby on Rails applications before turning their attention to the blockchain. They now focus on digital asset management apps and exchanges. They have only bid on a few other domain names, including being the runner-up on identity. The Chinese Dev Shop also is developing applications for the BAT, the Basic Attention Token, which brings blockchain technology into adtech.========================================#9 \u201cThe Big Fat Corporate Squatter\u201d159 Domains Purchased$371,800 Committed ETH (in $s)$5,280 \u201cDry Powder\u201d remaining in WalletMost Expensive 5 Domains: AmericanExpress; CapitalOne; Nationwide; LockheedMartin; MetLifeWhile we saw an example above of the low-budget squatter who was going after cheap derivatives and typos of brand names and individuals, here\u2019s the first big bucks example of someone doing wrong by doing it right. The Big Fat Corporate Squatter has focused on well-heeled (mostly financial) corporations and has spent big to get pristine names. The Big Fat Corporate Squatter owns almost no descriptive names, like \u201cbanking\u201d or \u201cfinancial services\u201d which can have legitimate usage, but instead only pursues well-known corporate trademarks. While the BFCS has little money left in his wallet, at this point he is still in the top 10 on funds spent for domain registrations.========================================Some other behind the scenes stories of interestThe Perpetual Runnerup:5 Domains Purchased$45.14 Committed ETH (in $s)$2,154,428 \u201cDry Powder\u201d remaining in WalletMost Expensive 5 Domains: options; cricket; downloads; drugsmarket; dnslinkOne brave soul stepped up and bet huge on DarkMarket and OpenMarket. But he didn\u2019t know that the O.G. had targeted those same names. Because the auction process charges 0.5% of your bid as an earnest fee, the Perpetual Runnerup quickly dropped $39,000 worth of ether making his massive but ill-fated bids. The moral: tangle with the O.G. at your own risk. He did pick up 5 other domain for a little under $12 grand, giving him the strange distinction of losing 3x more money on fees making 2 bad bids than he actually ended up spending on five real domains. Not that he cares. He was one of those people involved two years ago on the ground floor, and he still has a cool $2.1 million in available Ether sitting in his wallet.While Perpetual Runnerup missed DarkMarket, he scored drugsmarket.

Find me on Twitter and don\u2019t hesitate to get in touch.\u2620\ufe0f Ether\u2019s rough weekUnless you were living under a rock for the past week, you know that Ethereum\u2019s network value tanked. The price of Ether dropped to $170 on Wednesday, marking a 90% fall from its all-time high, reminiscent of Bitcoin\u2019s epic 87% drawdown which ended in January 2015.So is Ethereum dead?It wouldn\u2019t be all that unreasonable to wonder. Narratives are so powerful in this industry, and we\u2019ve recently seen one emerge which posits that decentralized applications are \u201ccapitulating\u201d and mass-selling Ether from their ICOs on the open market.If you dig into the numbers, you\u2019ll realize this isn\u2019t actually the case. Diar\u2019s Larry Cermak published an insightful tweet storm on Monday that largely refutes the idea of an Ether death spiral:It\u2019s worth noting that projects are still holding 38% of the Ether they raised, and without revenues, they\u2019ll likely be selling on the open market to cover expenses in the future. But the rumors of a mass capitulation were greatly exaggerated.As investors and operators navigate this market, we have to be comfortable with the fact that price movements are often a function of narrative and market structure (like BitMex offering ETH futures) \u2014 not fundamentals.\ud83c\udfa7 To hear more on this topic, check out this recent Venture Stories podcast I recorded on the bull case for Ethereum \u2192 LinkLet\u2019s dive into this week\u2019s newsletter!\ud83d\udd25 ThoughtsBubbles, narratives, and mass movementsTony Sheng drops an instant classic with an exploration of environments in which narratives fuel speculative bubbles. He argues that historically these environments have the following three properties:Lack of reliable or relevant historical data to form valuationsConditions that attract retail investors, oftentimes poor regulationRelative strength of narratives to grab attention in an opportunity rich investment environmentWe have all observed these properties in the crypto bubble over the past year.Tony asks whether things will change with future bubbles in crypto. For me, this is unlikely because although we\u2019re making progress with more reliable data and better regulation, valuation frameworks are still experimental and need to be proven out. This will take time.Debunking Market Narratives: Litecoin EditionTushar Jain of Multicoin Capital is back with another cryptoasset analysis \u2014 this time doing a deep dive on Litecoin.The verdict: despite being down more than 85% from its all-time high, LTC is still overvalued.Here was the most interesting part of the analysis for me. Tushar argues that Litecoin\u2019s security model is broken because, as block rewards decrease over time, the network must be secured by transaction fees. However, since Litecoin\u2019s key value proposition is cheap transactions, the number of transactions needed to maintain security of the network over time will likely surpass the network\u2019s capacity to process those transactions! This is a problem that could apply to other disinflationary Proof-of-Work cryptocurrencies boasting cheap transactions too (e.g. BCH).PoW is EfficientDan Held with a take on why Proof-of-Work may actually be efficient.This post is noteworthy because it synthesizes the views of many notable Bitcoiners into one narrative that pushes back on Proof of Work\u2019s wastefulness. I\u2019m a fan of PoW\u2013it\u2019s secure, battle-tested, and critiques of its wastefulness often miss the big picture. That said, this romanticized depiction of its energy consumption goes a bit too far for me, and it fails to recognize that other less-wasteful consensus mechanisms may provide better security guarantees in the future.Borderless Bitcoin: A Dangerous MythSpeaking of Proof-of-Work, Maximilian Fiege releases an epic post on why he believes electricity consumption makes Bitcoin less censorship resistant over time.The central point of his argument is that electricity is a politicized resource, and while Bitcoiners will say distributed energy is the future, he says empirically that\u2019s just not true.A Primer on Mining 2.0A short but thought-provoking post on Mining 2.0 by Erik Torenberg. Erik ponders some of the most esoteric questions facing crypto VCs today likeHow do you capture the value of decentralized technologies directly?How do you participate as an investor when there\u2019s no token or no equity\u2026?and argues that some firms will differentiate themselves by actively participating in decentralized networks (e.g. by running a staking node). I\u2019ve spent some time with firms who are making Generalized Mining their bread and butter, like CoinFund, and I\u2019m convinced that it\u2019s a winning model and something projects in the space are deeply interested in.Why Crypto Community Building Matters\ud83d\udd26Featured on Token Economy, by yours truly (Spencer)At Doggie Tail Crypto Capital, I\u2019ve helped a number of portfolio companies with their community building strategies.

Bookmark this because you might need it someday.Complexity TheaterThe King of Curation, Nathaniel Whittemore, drops a new term on us called Complexity Theater, which is when ideas are explained in an overly-complicated way to make them seem smarter.Complexity Theater is pervasive in crypto, mostly because our industry is so interdisciplinary. It\u2019s hard to be an expert in everything, so when we come across domain experts ourselves, we often hesitate to ask for things like clarification.Personally, I\u2019ve been making a point to ask companies that pitch me to break down technical concepts more slowly. It\u2019s proven to be extremely helpful when evaluating investments.Single collateral Dai \u2014 9 months in reviewRemarkable that Dai has remained stable even though the price of Ether crashed from $1472 to $170 over the past 9 months.Multi-collateral Dai is quickly approaching and that will only make the system more robust.Inspired by discussions with Cyrus Younessi, I\u2019ve been thinking about whether there might be a future relationship between the valuations of a native cryptocurrency (ETH), a governance token built on top of it (MKR), and the stablecoin it protects (DAI).Smart Contract Protocols \u2014 Part IAsh Egan begins his quest to research all of the smart contract protocols.There are currently 60 ways to deploy a smart contract!I believe there will be numerous complementary smart contract protocols someday. For the protocols that don\u2019t make the cut, I think they\u2019ll become sidechains of a more secure smart contract platform (e.g. Ethereum) or just die out altogether.The 4th era of crypto: Crypto-institutionalizationYaniv Feldman argues that we\u2019ve had three eras in crypto so farBitcoinAltcoinsUtility tokensand a new era is upon us: crypto-institutionalization, which is led by traditional financial institutions, banks, and even central banks.We\u2019ve seen numerous developments related to institutional adoption over the past few months.

SpencerFollowJun 14, 2018 \u00b7 4 min readThis was the top trending story on Reddit, I don\u2019t usually notice them but this one had multiple threads that were all trending.Bitcoin and ether are not securities, but some initial coin offerings may be, SEC official says.Ethereum\u2019s price is spiking after the news, and it\u2019s major news that we\u2019ve all been waiting for: SEC declares Ether not a security. This has ramifications for the blockchain and crypto startups moving forwards.Ether\u2019s price on June 13\u201314, CoindeskSEC on AltcoinsSpeaking at Yahoo Finance\u2019s All Markets Summit, William Hinman, the SEC\u2019s director of corporate finance, said the agency did not view bitcoin or ether as securities. Such a designation would require certain exchanges that facilitate trading of the cryptos to register with the agency. Thursday\u2019s announcement was the first time the SEC provided regulator clarity on specific coins.kryptoportal.skThe Biggest Crypto Debate of 2018 has an AnswerAre bitcoin and ether securities? Finally, one of the biggest questions and debates in crypto has been answered by the SEC, officially.While many ICOs are likely to be securities, Ethereum\u2019s decentralized structure appears central to why it is NOT a security. If a cryptocurrency is defined as a securities, it comes under the regulatory control of the SEC.\u201cWe don\u2019t see a lot of value in seeing ether as a security,\u201d William Hinman, head of the Division of Corporate Finance for the SEC, said at the Yahoo All Markets Summit: Crypto conference in San Francisco.This ruling changes the entire future of how dApp platforms can evolve and gives validity to what Ethereum has been insisting all along, that it\u2019s not a security. Curiously though over the last 24 hours, in terms of price fluctuations, EOS has seen the biggest increase.While SEC leaders have publicly labeled bitcoin as a commodity, this is the first clear statement by the financial watchdog on how they plan to regulate ether. In 2018, Bitcoin is a commodity and Ether is not a security.We have to walk a fine balance between being pro-innovation while also protecting investors. ICOs have a high failure rate, a high fraud rate and much of the funds are prone to lapses in security and cyber-hacks resulting in theft. According to the SEC, if a cryptocurrency network is sufficiently decentralized and purchasers no longer have expectation of managerial stewardship from a third party, a coin is not a security. So common sense has prevailed, it\u2019s basically as we had all assumed.Ethereum is one of the champions of decentralization and appear to have a legitimate way forwards. However, for many of the ICOs built on Ethereum\u2019s network, they would be considered securities. What we call a crypto asset does not change the economic reality of how it operates \u2014 thus similarly, labeling an investment opportunity as a \u201ccoin\u201d or a \u201ctoken\u201d does not make something not a security. This is important for investors and crypto startups to fully understand, and not take a dubious position on it that\u2019s high-risk.To say that Ethereum has become a popular platform for developers using blockchain, would be an understatement. It\u2019s the dApp platform that is by far the most dominant in 2018. So the SEC\u2019s ruling on this, has a huge impact on the future of cryptocurrencies and blockchain startups worldwide.I think the next question has to be if the cryptocurrency XRP is a security. It\u2019s already the subject of a lawsuit alleging that it is a security. Ripple is the name of the San Francisco-based company developing a network for faster global financial payments. However XRP is highly centralized. Ripple has been so pro-active with XRP and partnerships, so the manipulative connection here should make regulators wary that it does behave as a security.

A technological moonshot with an uncertain fate.It\u2019s easy to forget, but back in 2014 it wasn\u2019t 100% clear whether the platform would even function in a sustainable fashion. In the run-up to Ethereum going live, someone published a site poking good-natured fun at its ambitious goals and absence of a actual live platform. It nicely captured the prevailing sentiment in those pre-Frontier days.Fast-forward four years (approximately four decades in crypto time), and theory has been translated to practice\u2026with astonishing results. While it hasn\u2019t been the world\u2019s smoothest journey \u2014 we\u2019ve had our share of reentrancy bumps and multi-sig bruises along the way \u2014 nobody doubts whether this technology actually works. It\u2019s a testament to just how far we\u2019ve come.Today our colorful decentralized ecosystem includes hundreds of functional DApps, a thriving developer and meetup community, strong underlying infrastructure, rainbow unicorns and dancing badgers, and quantifiable advantages over other blockchain platforms. The paramount question on our collective minds has morphed from \u201cdoes it work?\u201d to \u201cdoes it scale?\u201dThere are plenty of reasons to be optimistic that scaling will work out on a technical basis; the sheer number of smart and dedicated minds working on state channels, POS, sharding, Plasma chains and their ilk is beyond promising.However, amidst the lively debates, discussions, and hand-wringing over technical scaling, it\u2019s important not to lose sight of its equally crucial counterpart: community scaling.In this author\u2019s humble opinion, Ethereum\u2019s thriving community \u2014 underpinned by a handful of widely-shared values \u2014 is our greatest strength. While a strong and vibrant community isn\u2019t a sufficient condition for the platform\u2019s long-term success, it may very well be a necessary one. Without it, we may not have come this far. And unless we maintain and cultivate this strength, we run the risk of falling short of the technology\u2019s full potential.This raises the question: what exactly are those core values? What makes Ethereum a fun place to be? How can we preserve and maintain these characteristics as more individuals and organizations join the fold? What potholes do we face on the road to successful community scaling?The recent \u201cShared Values\u201d survey, which was conceptualized and distributed by Jarrad Hope of Status, can help us answer these questions. In an effort to find common threads, themes, and suggestions, I\u2019ve taken a qualitative and decidedly non-scientific approach to analyzing the data. (For a very thorough quantitative analysis, courtesy of Mamy Ratsimbazafy, check this out.)Full responses to the questions are here. If you have the time, take a moment to read through the responses and find your own conclusions. Also consider the fact that despite my best efforts, my own biases toward collaboration, diplomacy, and unity as the default status for humans may have clouded the following analysis.So \u2014 let\u2019s see what people are saying, and how they\u2019re feeling.Takeaway #1: We Want to Create a Better WorldAnecdotally, a sense of optimism seems to permeate and inform much of the community. This is something that\u2019s tangible. Attend a hackathon, Devcon, or other meatspace event, and you can feel it in the air. Many people seem to join the Ethereum world for one big reason: they believe this new decentralized technology has the power to improve life on our little pale blue dot of a planet.\u201cLook again at that dot. That\u2019s here. That\u2019s home. That\u2019s us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives\u2026every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there, on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.\u201d \u2014 Carl Fucking SaganSurvey responses reflect this optimism; the phrase \u201cbetter world\u201d appears 9 times. Interestingly, equality (or a desire to address inequality) appears 20 times. This quest for a more egalitarian society is a notable departure from the Bitcoin community, which tends to focus more exclusively on expanded individual freedom stemming from an alternative to centralized fiat\u2019s monopoly.However, the two are not mutually exclusive; cypherpunk and libertarianism are well-represented responses to \u201cWhat are 3 or more organizations, communities, social movements and/or ideologies that are (loosely) related to Ethereum?\u201d Many Ethereans are proudly carrying the cypherpunk torch that gave rise to decentralized platforms in the first place.One beautiful thing about this technology is its potential ability to promote income equality without trouncing individual rights. For example, Universal Basic Income (also mentioned several times in the survey) becomes much more plausible and palpable when united with a voluntary, global, transparent, censorship-resistant distribution mechanism.There are also multiple shout-outs to Effective Altruism. This type of thinking is a solid fit with the possible advent of a post-scarcity world, as spelled out in Jeremy Rifkin\u2019s eye-opening book, \u201cThe Zero Marginal Cost Society.\u201dAltruism is also reflected in the high number of responders who mentioned Giveth (an organization dedicated to decentralized altruism), and/or its founder, Griff Green. Bitcoin has already produced an incredible precedent for charitable giving in the Pineapple Fund. Here\u2019s hoping these powerful acts of generosity can serve as an example for all of us in Ethereum.Rhys Lindmark typifies the underlying world-betterment sentiment that\u2019s shared by many Ethereans:\u201cTwo things (give my life meaning):1. Meaningful human connection2. Empowering others to have meaningful human connection. i.e. Trying to maximize how long humanity \u201c\u201dstays around\u201d\u201d (an infinite game of antifragility\u2026the x axis of time) + maximizing happiness while we\u2019re around (releasing folks from a scarcity mindset, moving them up Maslow\u2019s hierarchy\u2026the y-axis of happiness).\u201dTakeaway #2: There Are Many Schelling Points of ConversationsEthereum critics often argue that the platform is centralized in its discourse, due to the purported cult status surrounding its creator. The survey responses indicate that there\u2019s something very different happening in the space: engaging discussions are revolving around dozens of thought-leaders (for lack of a better term). This is evidenced by the wide array of responses to the \u201cwho are your Ethereum role models (other than Vitalik)?\u201d question:Check out Alex Van De Sande\u2019s twitter for more interesting survey word clouds.Given this wide range of respected individuals, one can infer that the just about anyone can influence and guide discussions in Ethereum; it doesn\u2019t require that you\u2019re with the Ethereum Foundation or a large organization such as Consensys. It simply requires a steady stream of innovative thought and well-articulated ideas. (The occasional meme doesn\u2019t hurt either).If you have interesting ideas but aren\u2019t actively sharing them, what\u2019s stopping you? Your audience on twitter, medium, and reddit awaits.Takeaway #3: Onboarding and UX Need ImprovementA failure to bring new participants into the ecosystem was cited by multiple respondents as an area for improvement. Ethereum does have a steep learning curve, for users and developers alike. The former may have lot to do with a sub-par UX, which was also a common issue cited in the survey.Why is UX a challenge? It\u2019s not for a lack of awesome developers and front-end designers in the space. The reason stems from the fact that we\u2019re working with an entirely new paradigm. It goes far beyond the UX challenges confronted by our internet pioneer forebearers in the mid-90\u2019s. Back then, mainstream users didn\u2019t understand the fundamental properties of TCP/IP and SMTP \u2014 but that was OK, because their Mosaic/Netscape browser showed them interesting things. They could chat in real-time with people in distant places, and their electronic mails arrived in prompt fashion. No stamps required. The value proposition was intuitive and self-evident.A/S/L?Similarly, potential mainstream users don\u2019t need to understand what makes blockchains tick under the skin. However, the value proposition for DApps may not be as obvious unless users grasp the fundamental properties of distributed computing: default transparency, censorship resistance, and non-immutability. (A very basic understanding of hashing wouldn\u2019t hurt either).A humble suggestion for builders of DApps: beware the \u201ccurse of knowledge.\u201d If your goal is to take your beautiful service to the mainstream, test it front of users who know nothing about blockchain technology. Do they understand how to use it? Do they understand why it\u2019s so much better than the centralized alternative? Is it as frictionless as the tried-and-true centralized web and mobile apps that have already eaten the world?On a more global note, Jazil Zaim also had an interesting and very relevant point about casting an overly-narrow net with respect to spreading awareness about the platform:\u201cEthereum is failing to reach out to the masses about its potential. The team tends to travel to countries where people already have freedoms and it\u2019s usually a bunch of developers showing up at Ethereum conferences. By targeting emerging markets and countries with repressive regimes, Ethereum could show the world that it is truly censorship resistant and it can\u2019t be blocked by governments.\u201dRepressive societies are perhaps the most apt fit for blockchain technology. How can we educate, inform, and equip them with the tools that can make them freer?Takeaway #4: We Are Utterly, Utterly Sick Of ICO\u2019sThere are dozens of mentions of ICO\u2019s in the survey, and they\u2019re almost universally negative. Collectively, we seem to believe there is absolutely nothing interesting about ICO\u2019s, and in fact they can be quite annoying with their mindless hype and lack of actual business models.Lane Rettig nailed this common prevailing sentiment, answering the \u201cwhat exhausts or tires you about the community?\u201d question:\u201cPeople shilling ICOs. Non-technical folks who haven\u2019t created any value constantly grabbing the limelight and spouting things that aren\u2019t inline with the ethos of the buidlers. There are too many conferences and events and most aren\u2019t very high quality.\u201dThese three offending aspects of the community are inextricably tied together. Anecdotally, the ICO hype seems to have died down quite a bit since its peak last summer. And for BUIDLers, this aspect of the ecosystem couldn\u2019t be any less interesting or relevant; at ETHDENVER, I didn\u2019t hear a single person discuss crypto prices or ICO\u2019s. Attendees of EDCON and ETHBuenosAires probably had a similar experience.If Ethereum\u2019s only killer DApp turns out to be crowdfunding, the platform will ultimately be replaced by something better. (Fortunately, that\u2019s highly, highly unlikely. Just ask the Cryptokitties team.)Takeaway #5: Reddit Fatigue Is Setting InFor better or for worse, the majority of our public discourse happens on Reddit. However, some Ethereans are getting sick of a perceived increase in shilling, toxicity, and trolling. One anonymous responder captured a common sentiment:\u201cThe online community is beset by trolls who I feel manage to have an outsized impact on the community. We need tools that can represent stakeholders better than whoever posts most frequently on Reddit.\u201dWhile things haven\u2019t descended to the level of r/bitcoin (a formerly-cool place beset by groupthink, censorship, and trolling), we still need new alternatives to r/ethereum. Reddit\u2019s upvoting system can discourage open discourse; post something that\u2019s perceived as \u201cnegative\u201d \u2014 for example, a critique of sharding \u2014 and watch the downvotes roll in. This mindless knee-jerk reaction can lower visibility for important critiques and criticisms of the technology we\u2019re building.It stands to reason that a decentralized platform should have multiple discussion forums, rather than one centralized nexus. Ideally, we need sybil-resistant alternatives. This is crucial from a governance perspective as well; for example, sock-puppet accounts can create the illusion that a certain proposal has more (or less) support than it really does. This problem is begging for a solution that combines the self-sovereign identity of uPort with forum registration/management capabilities. Who\u2019s working on it?The Stakes Are HighIf Ethereum is going to realize its full, brilliant, world-transforming potential, it\u2019s crucial that we get community scaling right.Cultural change is inevitable as the ecosystem grows. But at the core, it\u2019s not unreasonable to think that we can preserve the underlying sense of optimism and altruism \u2014 combined with a healthy dose of open, respectful debate and discussion\u2014 that makes Ethereum fun and exciting.The \u201cfun\u201d element can\u2019t be overstated. Ethereum is a giant judgement-free zone where you can feel free to be yourself, explore entirely new ideas for business and society, and generally push the envelope in a very encouraging environment. It\u2019s a liberating experience.Comparing Ethereum to Burning Man, Rhys distilled this underlying ethos:\u201c\u2026we both value creativity, expressing your authentic self (and the reverse \u2014 no judgment), and imaging a new world.\u201dPiper Merriam also noted some similarities with the annual festival:(Burning Man has a) central entity which orchestrates but doesn\u2019t \u201ccontrol\u201d, relies on broad community buy in and collaboration for the \u201cthing\u201d to be successful, outsider view often sees it as indulgent/wasteful/confusing.DCMatt, Flickr / CC-BY 2.0 https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/Eva Beylin may have put it best:\u2026Ethereum is a rainbow of very bizarre, intellectual and interesting people that just want to build a world of acceptance & have fun.That sounds like something worth preserving and expanding. And perhaps Ethereum \u2014 and blockchain technology in general \u2014 even has the potential to create a full-fledged societal movement. But\u2026that\u2019s a topic for another day.Note: if you haven\u2019t had a chance to lend your voice to the survey, you can do so here.Also Note: While governance is a crucial aspect of community scaling, I\u2019ve left it out of this article; it\u2019s an area outside of my current expertise. Governance is a huge issue that deserves its own analysis \u2014 and in fact, was a major impetus for the survey. Anyone out there want to give it a shot?Also Also Note: Consider the fact that the survey was solicited primarily from those who have been in Ethereum a relatively long time. This might skew the data .

These tokens will be backed 1:1 with Ether, and can be withdrawn and exchanged for ETH at any time.Meanwhile, whilst they remain within the Waves blockchain ecosystem, the Waves ETH tokens can be stored securely and transferred with the speed and low cost of the Waves network. In particular, it will be possible to trade them against other Waves tokens \u2014 including WBTC and WAVES itself. This means that users will be able to trade ETH peer-to-peer on DEX, against BTC, WAVES, USD and EUR, as well as any other token.

One where people have complete independence, choice, and control of their assets. One where you can live in the Ether. But what does it mean, for you, for everyone?This vision is well on its path to actualisation. The rise of decentralised exchanges and other financial services (DeFi) is offering more and more ways to spend, borrow, lend and move assets around in a decentralized and non-custodial fashion. The development of DeFi is a unique opportunity to usher a new era in finance, where the focus on profitability and returns is swapped for an obsession of empowerment: giving people back full control over their assets is a game-changer.Here at TokenCard, we\u2019re doing our part and addressing one critical element of the DeFi ecosystem: spending your assets in the real world, the way you\u2019re used to. We\u2019re now providing the world first non-custodial debit card, available in the UK and the 31 countries of the EEA.That\u2019s not it, here\u2019s the good news: the whole process is easy and you\u2019re already only 8 steps away from financial sovereignty and autonomy. Ready to live your life on Ethereum?Step 1\u2014 Installing the TokenCard AppThe TokenCard app is now live on the App Store! Download it to start setting up your wallet and order your card:Responsibility is the price of freedomStep 2\u2014 Secure Your WalletOnce you have the app, there are a few more steps required to ensure the safety of your funds before you can deploy your Contract Wallet.The PIN is the main authentication method you use daily. It will be required when you open the app or initiate an action such as a card top-up.Write down your seed and store it somewhere safe (more on this below); you won\u2019t need it for your day-to-day usage of the app.\u26a0\ufe0f Depending on your device model, you might be using either FaceID, your fingerprints or a PIN code to authenticate. Your TokenCard PIN code is completely unrelated to your device PIN. However, you will need device-level authentication to validate transactions.Securing your TokenCard Contract Wallet\u26a0\ufe0fSECURING YOUR SEED IS CRITICAL\u26a0\ufe0fTokenCard is a non-custodial wallet, if you lose access to your seed, there is nothing we can do for you: responsibility is the price of freedom.Here are some recommendations/best practices to secure your seed:Risk minimization: Always use an offline support to write it down: a piece of paper can\u2019t be hacked!Contextless: Never write anything else than your seed on the paper where it\u2019s written. Even if someone finds it, he won\u2019t have the context to know what to do with it.Redundancy: Make sure your seed is written down on at least two pieces of paper, secured in two different locations.Inheritance: Your wallet, if properly secured, is eternal; you\u2019re not. If you are storing a significant amount of money in there, consider putting someone else you trust in the loop so they can recover the funds if anything was to happen to you.Going further: You can encode your seed so that even if someone finds the paper he won\u2019t be able to access the funds. Make sure you remember the encryption technique you used.Step 3\u2014 Deploy Your Contract WalletNext up, deploy your Contract Wallet. The Contract Wallet governs your whole relationship with TokenCard \u2014 one where nobody but you can control your money. It stores your funds while also gives you ways to secure your assets even further. You can setup Spending Limits to restrain the value of assets that can be sent from your wallet. The limits can then be bypassed by defining Whitelisted Addresses to preserve functionality.Now here\u2019s the coolest part: with just one tap, you will deploy your own instance of the Smart Contract Wallet. Nobody else but you has access or control over it.Deploying your own instance of the Contract Wallet in a tapVerification stepsWelcome into the Ether! You now have a top-notch, secure Contract Wallet at your fingertips. When it comes to shipping cards, we also need to fulfil our regulatory requirements. This is where KYC comes in.To get started, click the Card (\u2018\ud83d\udcb3\u2019) tab.Step 4\u2014 Verify Your Identity (KYC)To order a card, we must verify your identity. Our KYC procedure is standard: you\u2019ll need an official document (government ID, passport or driver\u2019s license) and you will have to take a selfie.By providing this information, we will be using third parties to perform checks on your identity, such as validating your address. Basically, confirming you are who you are.In addition to validating your identity, we also run checks on your source of funds. Using other third parties we can validate that the crypto you are moving into the wallet is clean as we do not want this product offering to be used for money laundering.Step 5\u2014 Verify Your Address and Order the TokenCard CardIt is possible that as part of the checks we need further information to prove you live at the address specified. This should not concern you, our compliance team may reach out to you and ask for a proof of address document.Make sure you have one the following documents at your disposal, including your name and address on it (it must be <= 3 months):Utility bill: internet, electricity, gas\u2026 The only one we can\u2019t accept is a mobile phone service bill.Government/Tax-related: your tax report, or any official government document figuring your name and address will do.While ordering your card, you can decide the base currency it will be using: GDP(\u00a3) or EUR (\u20ac). The base currency has an impact on the fee structure, so make sure you pick wisely.Activating and spending with TokenCardStep 6\u2014 Activate Your CardFast forward a few days (we\u2019re living the life on Ethereum, but your postal service isn\u2019t\u2026 yet): your card has arrived! Take a moment to let it sink in, then share the good news on your networks (remember to hide your PAN, just for safety).Activating your cardYou won\u2019t be able to use your card until you\u2019ve activated it in the TokenCard App. Head back to the Card (\u2018\ud83d\udcb3\u2019) section, and type in the last 4 digits of your card\u2019s PAN to activate.Step 7\u2014 Your First Top-upAdding funds in your walletIf you haven\u2019t sent funds to your wallet yet, now is a good time! Tap \u201cReceive\u201d to display your Contract Wallet address and QR code \u2014 fill your boots with ETH, TKN, or DAI.You need some ETH to top-up your gas tank. The TokenCard app will only support the three following tokens: ETH, TKN and DAI. More ERC-20 tokens are coming soon!Topping up your gas tankOnce you have some ETH in your contract wallet, don\u2019t forget to top up your gas tank. You will need gas to top up your card, as all transactions in the TokenCard app happen on-chain.Topping up your gas tankTopping up your debit cardWith some funds in your wallet and gas in your tank, you can now top-up \u2014 sell some cryptocurrencies for fiat \u2014 so that you\u2019re ready to spend:Topping up your card\u2139\ufe0f Top-ups involve on-chain transactions requiring 3 confirmations. At the current state of the Ethereum network, it means the top-up transaction takes up to 90s to be visible in the app.Step 8\u2014 Spending With Your TokenCardYour card supports any payment system you\u2019re used to. Your first purchase must be Chip and PIN, but after that, it\u2019s however you like to spend \u2014 in-store, online, Contactless, ATM. If you\u2019re left wondering what your PIN is, here\u2019s how to find it:View your card PIN with the TokenCard App\u26a0\ufe0f TokenCard is still in an early testing phase. If you encounter any bugs or find your experience confusing, feel free to initiate a report. It\u2019s easy, simply shake your phone to get started.Congratulations!

Some experts even muse that ether has the potential to overtake bitcoin in the future.What are the reasons behind the expected rise of the world\u2019s #2 digital currency?Will Ethereum Induce \u201cThe Flippening\u201d?\u201cThe Flippening\u201d is the term used by cryptocurrency enthusiasts to describe the theoretical moment when bitcoin is surpassed by another cryptocurrency. Although whether and when \u201cThe Flippening\u201d will occur is still a matter of speculation, ether is the cryptocurrency that appears to have the best chances of dethroning bitcoin.Olaf Carlson-Wee, CEO of Polychain Capital hedge fund, is one who believes ether will surpass bitcoin\u2019s market cap as early as this year.\u201cLast time I was on here, I said Ethereum would pass bitcoin by the end of 2018. I would actually hold to that right now,\u201d he told Bloomberg late last year.The more prevalent prediction is that the value of ether should settle around US $1,500, according to research conducted by International Business Times.While it\u2019s impossible to know exactly what chances ether has of overtaking bitcoin, there is little doubt that ether\u2019s price is ready to move upwards. After exuberant heights, it now seems undervalued, even vis a vis bitcoin.One of the differences between ether and bitcoin is that ether is faster, with transactions settling in seconds as opposed to minutes. Also, Ethereum is more versatile: it is a platform and operating system for distributed computing with its own currency. Its blockchain is more sophisticated, capable of storing computer code, while the bitcoin blockchain is more like a database of wallets with an amount of currency in each.https://minerone.io/invest-in-miner-one/The Surge of Dapps on the Ethereum NetworkThe Ethereum network appears to be well-positioned to remain the leading platform for launching ICOs in upcoming years. Decentralised applications known as \u201cDapps\u201d are also ceaselessly popping up on the Ethereum network.\u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing with Ethereum is exponential increase in the number of projects \u2014 there are billions of dollars being poured into the ecosystem right now \u2014 maybe 10 times more projects this year than last year, which could easily lead to a doubling, probably a tripling in price by the end of the year,\u201d says Steven Nerayoff, best known as the co-creator and token sale architect of the Ethereum project, early this year.Moreover, the research team at Investing Haven predicts that such growth will continue in the future and become a long-term trend:\u201cEthereum\u2019s usage in decentralised blockchain applications will go up 20- to 30-fold over the next 5 to 7 years. That is not an overstatement, but rather an understatement,\u201d says the team.Smart Contracts & Proof-of-StakeSmart contracts are one major reason why Ethereum\u2019s popularity is spiking. For the uninitiated, these are blockchain-based digital contracts that are executed automatically without a third party\u2019s involvement and risk of fraud. \u201cIt is the foundation of the majority of past and current ICOs in today\u2019s cryptocurrency market,\u201d notes Kenny Li, CTO of Cloud Spectator.Ethereum is also planning to switch this year from its current proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake algorithm. Although the switch will be partial at first, it has the potential to address scaling issues.\u201cThe Ethereum network expects big changes in the next few months. Ethereum officially announced plans to change to proof-of-stake. Now they\u2019re testing proof-of-stake technology. We will have to see how profitable operations will be after the change,\u201d said Pranas Slusnys, CEO of Miner One, in response to questions about whether Miner One\u2019s plans include mining ether.Is It Worth Mining Ether?Miner One\u2019s business plan includes the option to upgrade mining hardware and start mining ether when or if this becomes more profitable. For now, according to Slusnys, bitcoin remains the most profitable mining option. As recent DMG Blockchain Solutions research concludes, bitcoin mining \u2014 if done with industrial efficiency \u2014 is more profitable than most people would assume:\u201cAssuming one has an electricity price of $0.07 or slightly higher, it should still be possible to break even as long as the Bitcoin price remains above $2,400,\u201d says the company.Miner One fits that bill. Which is why, despite dramatic market fluctuations, Slusnys remains upbeat.\u201cWe know that in environments like these, the ones who make it are the ones with the right skills and know-how, the best technology, and the courage to get in and stay the course.

It\u2019s possible to send and receive ETH easily, without being need to download the whole Blockchain for the task.However, many of these wallets haven\u2019t added support for ERC-20 tokens. These tokens are used often as a trading value in many ICOs, and also given to the users as \u201cpayment\u201d for their contribution.With Chronologic\u2019s ICO it wasn\u2019t different. There are steps to be taken to visualize and use these tokens for some wallets.Now, let\u2019s talk about the wallets that really allow users full control over their address. Among them we have Jaxx, MyEtherWallet, Blockchain.info, and others. If you\u2019ve made your contribution from any of these rest assured that with a few simple steps you can manage and even transfer your DAY tokens. However, if you\u2019ve sent your contribution from Coinbase, Bittrex, Poloniex, FreeWallet, BTC Markets or Kraken, among others, then you have a problem.In order to check the DAY tokens inside your ETH address, you don\u2019t need to unblock/open your wallet, rather only type your wallet\u2019s address on EtherScan.io or Ethplorer.io.Now, if you really want to move your DAY tokens, or any other ERC-20 asset from those wallets, then you\u2019ll have to access it using the Private Key, JSON file and password, etc.Today we\u2019ll feature a quick tutorial on how to recover your Private Key from an Ether wallet hosted by Blockchain.info.Step #1: Login into your Blockchain.info account.Step #2: Click on \u201cEther\u201d (left side of your screen).Step #3: Select the option \u201cExport Private Key\u201d, as demonstrated below.Step #4: This warning mentions the implied risks of exposing your Private Key. Basically, never let anyone else see it and always double-check the website where you\u2019re inserting it into.After that, type the master password for your Blockchain.info account.All set, now you can see your Ethereum address and Private Key for this specific wallet. ATTENTION! Everyone with access to this sequence can send any tokens or ETH or tokens stored on this wallet.Now, to move forward, copy the Private Key.This time, we\u2019ll use MyEtherWallet.com to manage this wallet via its Private Key. Once you\u2019re there, click on \u201cSend Ether & Tokens\u201d, select \u201cPrivate Key\u201d and paste your Private Key on the field. After that, click on \u201cUnlock\u201d.That\u2019s it! Now MyEtherWallet will show all the tokens you have on that address, allowing you to send them wherever you want, even to your exchange.", "responses": 2, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Ethereum", "Chronologic"]}, {"title": "iungo prebuys 200 Ether worth of Birdchain tokens for future services!", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@birdchain_io/iungo-prebuys-200-ether-worth-of-birdchain-tokens-for-future-services-3e760361c350?source=search_post", "author_name": "Birdchain", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@birdchain_io", "publish_date": "2018-01-29", "last_modified_date": "2018-05-09", "readtime": "0.83", "claps": 73, "voters": 19, "content": "iungo prebuys 200 Ether worth of Birdchain tokens for future services!BirdchainFollowJan 29, 2018 \u00b7 1 min readIungo & Birdchain PartnershipIungo has signed a partnership with Birdchain \u2014 prebuying 200 Ether worth of Birdchain tokens for their future service!What is Iungo?Iungo is an open-source platform that enables anyone to become a local internet provider in the global WiFi network.

I\u2019m a bit confused because I wrote the original post after Shapeshift announced they were leaving New York.I\u2019m a curious person by nature and decided to look into this further. Less than 5 minutes of research revealed a solution. I\u2019ve updated this post to include the workaround. See step 3B for the update.Update #2 \u2014 Coinbase is now approved to trade Ether, even in New York State.Now anyone can establish an account on Coinbase and buy Ether with USD.I should say here that I wrote this article as an academic exploration of how to but Ether with USD. It\u2019s not intended, at all, to be an offer of investment advice, tax advice or anything else remotely related to using Ether as a financial vehicle.I\u2019m simply a blockchain enthusiast. I enjoy challenges and enjoy experimenting with new technologies. I only work with very small amounts of Bitcoin and Ether during my experiments.I live in Brooklyn, New York. A blockchain sticker on a mailbox in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, sparked my interest in blockchain. You can read more about how that happened here.This interest lead me to Ethereum and now Golem. I\u2019m planning to participate in Golem\u2019s crowdfunding process tomorrow. You can read more about how I plan to do that here.First I need Ether. This post describes the steps I used to buy Ether in USD. It\u2019s not a straightforward process right now.Living in New York makes it even more complicated. We have this thing called the Bitlicense here. It\u2019s meant to protect us from devious exchange operators. Apparently the Winkelvoss Twins aren\u2019t devious, since their exchange was the first to receive a Bitlicense. (It\u2019s true, you can look it up!)Oh well, moving on\u2026Disclaimer! This post is not intended to convince you to buy Ether with USD. It\u2019s simply to provide information, e.g. if you\u2019re interested in Ethereum and/or have already decided to buy Ether with USD. It is NOT a recommendation or offer of investment advice IN ANY WAY!How Long Does it Take to Buy Ether with USD?The process took me about a month of on-again-off-again trial-and-error to figure out. It should take you about a week following these steps.Two factors contribute to the delay \u2014ID verification when you create an exchange accountPurchase account, i.e. credit card or bank account, verification in your exchange accountYou may not experience this delay if you live outside of New York. The exchange operators here have to comply with the Bitlicense, remember (SMH)?To be on the safe side, I\u2019d still suggest giving yourself a week to establish the process.How to Buy Ether in USDStep 1 \u2014 Create an Exchange AccountThe first step is to create an exchange account. You\u2019ll use this account to buy Bitcoin or Ether with a USD-denominated credit card or bank account.I did a lot of research and decided to use Coinbase. I didn\u2019t want to give my money to the Winkelvoss Twins. That ruled out their exchange.Coinbase was one of the small number of exchanges operating with a Bitlicense. Union Square Ventures has invested in Coinbase too. I admire Fred Wilson from Union Square Ventures. The fact he\u2019s trusting Coinbase made me comfortable doing the same.The initial ID verification process on Coinbase was frustrating. It seems to be fixed now.Step 2 \u2014 Add a Purchase Method to your Exchange AccountI chose to add a credit card to my account. I\u2019m still experimenting with Ether. This means I\u2019m buying very small amounts of Ether. Using a credit card felt like the easiest and safest way to do this.I wasn\u2019t comfortable linking a bank account to my Coinbase account. I figured if Coinbase ever got hacked, I\u2019d have the credit card fraud department to back me up on any fraudulent transactions. My bank would do the same, however I might be out the cash during the resolution period.Step 3 \u2014 Buy Ether Using your USD AccountIf you DON\u2019T live in New York, you can buy Ether on Coinbase using the account you added in Step 2. The Coinbase site makes it pretty easy.If you DO live in New York, you have to buy Bitcoin (NOT Ether) with the account you added in Step 2.Let me repeat this \u2014If you DO live in New York, you have to buy Bitcoin (NOT Ether) with the account you added in Step 2.The Coinbase UI/UX could use an update here. You can actually get to a point in the transaction where it looks like you can buy Ether with the account you added in Step 2.You\u2019ll add the USD amount, then the corresponding Ether amount WON\u2019T APPEAR.That\u2019s the only indication you\u2019ll receive the purchase of Ether won\u2019t work. I confirmed with Coinbase support that New York residents can only purchase Bitcoin.Congratulations if you don\u2019t live in New York, you\u2019re done!You now have Ether in your Coinbase wallet.(Note that some Ether transactions require you to use a wallet your control, rather than an exchange wallet, like Coinbase. If that\u2019s the case, you\u2019ll have to setup an Ether wallet.I\u2019ve tested the Ethereum Mist wallet, Parity and myetherwallet.myetherwallet is the way to go for me.It creates an Ether wallet for you in a single step. myetherwallet doesn\u2019t have to download the entire blockchain either. This will save you hours if not days, since downloading the entire blockchain takes that long.)Congratulations if you DO live in New York! We love it here for a lot of reasons, don\u2019t we? Ok, well the Bitlicense may not be one of them.Because of the Bitlicense, we have some more work to do here.[For New York Residents Only] Step 3A \u2014 Convert Bitcoin to to EtherMarch 2017 Update \u2014 The workaround mentioned above is to install a VPN on your computer. I like to use VPN\u2019s for many reasons.It turns out I had the Cloak VPN running on my laptop when I tried to access Shapeshift.io from New York. Magically, Shapeshift appeared, without the New York and North Korea notice :) I was able to exchange Bitcoin from my Coinbase wallet into Ether. The Ether was deposited into my Ether wallet.So install a VPN like Cloak, then follow the remaining steps.Use Shapeshift.io to convert your Bitcoin to Ether. To do this \u2014Setup your myetherwalletInitiate a Bitcoin to Ether transaction on Shapeshift.io, following Shapeshift\u2019s instructions. Do this by sending Bitcoin from your Coinbase Bitcoin wallet to the address Shapeshift.io generates for youConfirm receipt of your Ether in your myetherwalletOk, now you\u2019re done, even if you do live in New York! Go out and enjoy everything else New York has to offer :)P.S. If this post was helpful, please consider sending a small Ether contribution to me.

Only then can you evaluate the risk you\u2019re prepared to take. Here\u2019s 10 takeaway points about Ether.Camp\u2019s sale.If you only want the TL;DR, just read the bits in bold.Ether.Camp have already run successful events and projects.Ether.Camp\u2019s strength is trying to create a community of users around and within startups. They\u2019ve earned a lot of good faith within the community for this, and other projects, so have done far more to earn \u2018credit\u2019 than other recent crowdfunders.Ether.Camp are not trying to raise $50mContrary to how it may appear, the $50m thrown about is not a target but a limit. According to Ether.Camp, it\u2019s for safety. However, this is far higher than the recommendation of the Ethereum Foundation IIRC therefore calling it a safety feature is a mistake and it\u2019s obviously mislead people.Ether.Camp is for any startup, including Rootstock and non blockchain companies. This is not an investment in the Ethereum space. In fact, the whitepaper says \u201cYear 2016, we are starting the Virtual Accelerator (VA) to provide transparent and true acceleration to blockchain developers around the world\u201d and a Slack response yesterday goes further: \u201cRomanj: @keat we very much want to see people from different places joining hackathon, naturally the crypto guys were first to know\u2026 but any startup innovative idea ia very welcome\u201d. This is not a bad thing \u2014 it gives Ether.Camp longevity. However, it should be clearer.Ether.Camp receive the money, not the startups.The funding only goes to Ether.Camp. None of it goes to the startups other than via prizes or to a decentralised system. Note that prizes can also potentially come from sponsors. In essence, the fundraise is for Ether.Camp to run a set of online hackerthons using their framework. There is no discussion of how the exchange rate risk will be handled and how much regular currency (e.g. USD) is required for operations.Read the whitepaper. It won\u2019t take long because it\u2019s incomplete. One day before the sale and \u201c// TODO: add source code\u201d is still prevalent and there\u2019s a lack of detail throughout. Be aware that the crowdsale will be funding its own design.Understand how the HackerGold token works and how it may or may not provide an ROI.The token is given to startups in exchange for the right to vote against an expenditure request. The donor receives a token from the startup. This token is undefined. Note that startups (DSTs) cannot just issue tokens. Token issuance (unless Kickstarter reward style perhaps) needs to be carefully planned and with lawyers engaged, because of securities law, security, gameability, and use case. I can see the token may have some value given good startups but it\u2019s very hard to say how much because of the definition issue.HackerGold may have design flaws with regard to voting rights.If I understand correctly, the current design allows for startups to pay themselves HackerGold, thus allowing them (unknown to others) to control the expenditure blocking vote and the team impeachment vote. This would be near impossible to spot or stop, thus rendering the vote design critically flawed. It\u2019s particularly important because the vote will also control those investing ether after the camp. In addition, there is no discussion on how impeachment could actually work, what happens to funds prevented from being spent consistently, or discussion of the voting success rate (even the dao allowed this to be changed). Requiring 55% of the vote to block expenditure will inevitably break down at some point, even for bad actor companies because eventually people will get bored. I feel these problems should have been fixed before a crowdsale as they\u2019re quite fundamental.Kudos can be Sybil attacked.Kudos are the voting system used in Ether.Camp and are directly tied to prize money. Anyone can vote \u2014 it appears unrelated to HackerGold. The voting system is trivial to Sybil attack. In the AMA, Roman suggested they would throw out companies they see doing this. However, 1) hard to spot, 2) hard to conclusively prove, 3) an easy way to get another team thrown out, 4) what happens to the HKG people gave, 5) who is responsible. As we all know, voting systems are hard. In this case, however, we already have a set of judges so the simplest solution (and there will be better) is to use Kudos only as a signalling mechanism and let the judges decide. Since Kudos are not directly related to the crowdsale token, they can easily be fixed later.There is no published business model for Ether.Camp.HackerGold value relies on the continued existence of Ether.Camp but there is no business model published beyond the crowdfunding. If Ether.Camp are awarding prizes, they could be taking equity or some tokens IMV. This is actually better for everyone who invests in HKG as Ether.Camp need to be sustainable.Ether.Camp is a traditional uncapped (effectively) token sale.Similar to other crowdsales in this respect.In conclusion, the Ether.Camp project is one I support, the crowdfunder in present form not so much. It\u2019s being rushed in the face of others from lesser known companies who have lowered the bar of expectation rather than raised it (post DAO). This may all work out in the end but I genuinely wish Ether.Camp would have given this more time.Tomorrow I may launch AlexCoin. Next week I may even tell you how it works./Sarcasm", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Ethereum"]}, {"title": "Writing Software Contracts for Ethereum \u2014 Part 1", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@IndianGuru/writing-software-contracts-for-ethereum-part-1-a9c2eb1bd27?source=search_post", "author_name": "Satish Manohar Talim", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@IndianGuru", "publish_date": "2017-07-17", "last_modified_date": "2018-04-15", "readtime": "7.46", "claps": 95, "voters": 18, "content": "Writing Software Contracts for Ethereum \u2014 Part 1Satish Manohar TalimFollowJul 17, 2017 \u00b7 8 min read(Updated on 26th Jan. 2018)In Part 2 we understand some basics of Solidity language and write a simple software contract for Ethereum using Remix.In Part 3 we will setup our private blockchain using gethVenturing into the world of building smart contracts on Ethereum can be very daunting at first. Where do you start?Ethereum is really fast moving. This means a lot of the tutorials you will try and follow will not quite work.My search continues and I have plucked bits and pieces from all over the place and this is what I have come up with.First, the basics.The BasicsWho is Vitalik Buterin?Vitalik is the creator of Ethereum. He first discovered blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies through Bitcoin in 2011. He wrote the Ethereum white paper in November 2013. He now leads Ethereum\u2019s research team, working on future versions of the Ethereum protocol.What\u2019s a Blockchain?We have this idiom in the English language that goes something like this: \u201cset it in stone\u201d (we have a pretty high level of trust in stone). A blockchain is really just the above: a kind of material that, through a special mix of cryptography and decentralization, has the properties of permanence, transparency, and neutrality \u2014 whatever you put on it. Except now we can do it digitally.Ethereum is an open source blockchain platform with built in programming language that allows developers to write, test and execute their decentralized application (contract). Data stored on Ethereum blockchain can be viewed by anyone but one having the private key can access it, and is the owner. Any transaction performed is anonymous, parties involved are always unknown.At the most basic level a blockchain is a digital ledger of transactions, one that is accessible to the public and keeps track of transactions anonymously. It is an open-source software, which means that anyone can see what is happening and make changes to it. What is unique about it is that through cryptography, the recordings are secure and essentially unalterable. At the same time, any changes made to the ledger are distributed globally. Because essentially anyone can participate in and verify the transaction, it puts the power of verification in the hands of those who use it. Blockchain is virtually impossible to hack. This blockchain is not controlled by a central administrator, but instead each node in the network stores its own copy of the blockchain that is shared and visible to anyone within the network.Image Reference \u2014 https://bitsonblocks.net/In the image above, blocks in a chain refer to previous blocks, like page numbers in a bookEvery \u201cblock\u201d in this blockchain contains a record of recent transactions, a reference to the block that came immediately before it, and an answer to a difficult mathematical puzzle, among other things.A blockchain is collectively maintained by \u201cminers\u201d, who are members within the network that compete to validate Ether transactions in each block by solving the complex algorithmic problem associated with the block. They do this by buying or renting lots of computing power to run these complex algorithmic problems on. The incentive for them to use their computing power to verify transactions is that they are rewarded with Ether (shortened to ETH, is Ethereum\u2019s digital currency) if they solve the problem and validate a Ethereum block.Ethereum Blockchain App Platform\u2019s main page is \u2014 https://ethereum.org/Types of BlockchainsPublic blockchain like Bitcoin, Ethereum. Public blockchains by nature are open source.Consortium blockchain \u2014 example is R3 which is a distributed database technology company. It leads a consortium of more than 70 of the world\u2019s biggest financial institutions in research and development of blockchain database usage in the financial system. Just anybody can\u2019t get involved in the consensus process as one can do in a public blockchain.Private blockchain. A company\u2019s very private information may be kept on this type of blockchain. An example of this is MultiChain.Is Blockchain a revolutionary piece of technology?Yes.With the use of smart contracts (more on this later) on top of the blockchain along with no single point of failure it will be possible to transfer things of value such as property, vehicles etc. very securely (with the power of cryptography). As such this will allow us to transfer very securely things of extreme value. It also cuts out any middle man (Lawyers, Estate Agents etc.) in the above transactions. Also, deals or transactions get completed far quickly.What\u2019s Ethereum?Ethereum is software running on a network of computers that ensures that data and small computer programs called smart contracts are replicated and processed on all the computers on the network, without a central coordinator. The small computer programs being run are called smart contracts, and the contracts are run by participants on their machines using a sort of operating system called a \u201cEthereum Virtual Machine\u201d (EVM).In other words, Ethereum is an open software developer platform based on blockchain technology that makes it very easy for people to build and deploy decentralized applications (dapps).Ethereum applications will always, without fail, execute the code they say it will. The code can always be checked. One can personally check and ensure that it does what it says it does.There is no downtime. These applications are always going to be available.Ethereum applications are resistant to DDOS attacks.Previously building decentralized applications required a very good and complex knowledge of Cryptography or cryptology.Ethereum makes this technology available to all by simplifying it.Ethereum has a complete programming language, sometimes called EtherScript (though not so popularly used).How does the change a person makes with a transaction, gets verified by a majority and conformed into the blockchain?A user makes a transaction and broadcasts it to the network. The entire Ethereum network is a giant mass of nodes (computers) connected to one another.Nodes (computers) verify that the transaction is correctly signed and if so, pass it to their peers.A miner\u2019s node will take the transactions with a sufficient gas price (i.e, sufficient transaction fees) and process them to create the contents of the block.The miner tries random numbers until they find one that, hashed with the contents of a block, proves a sufficient amount of work.The miner broadcasts the block.Each node checks the validity of the entire block, from the header to verifying the result of every transaction, and if it checks out, it declares that block valid and passes it on. Otherwise, it ignores the block.Each node that handles the transaction personally checks to make sure it\u2019s valid. So even if it appears that every other node on the whole network insists that this or that transaction happened, a node can still decide that that transaction was invalid. \u201cConsensus\u201d means that everyone will hopefully reach the same answer eventually, not that nodes necessarily listen to the voice of the majority.Who is using Ethereum?Tech giant IBM is building a blockchain-based platform for seven big European banks, including HSBC and Deutsche Bank, that is aimed at simplifying trade finance transactions for small- and medium-sized companies.Other interested companies include Microsoft, JP Morgan Chase, Deloitte amongst many other large corporations.Then there is the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance that connects Fortune 500 enterprises, startups, academics, and technology vendors with Ethereum subject matter experts.Many dapps have already been built on Ethereum \u2014 https://dapps.ethercasts.com/Some of the areas, other than finance, where blockchain is being used are:Why become a Blockchain developer?There are five areas in which there is a growing need for blockchain developers:Startups in the Blockchain and Crytocurrency fieldCorporate Tech Firms like IBM, Microsoft etc.Banks especially global banksGovernment organizationsProfessional Services firms like KPMG, Deloitte, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), Ernst & Young (EY) etc.It is expected that the would-be blockchain developer has an understanding of:You are able to code in different languages especially like Java and C++You are comfortable with Large data setsYou have a basic understanding of CrytographyYou have a basic understanding of the BlockchainWhat\u2019s Ether?Ether (shortened to ETH) is Ethereum\u2019s digital currency.Every single step in a smart contract is a transaction or a complex computation. Running and storing things on Ethereum would have a cost that is measured in \u201cgas\u201d. The price of this gas is paid by the requester in \u201cEther\u201d. Ether is the digital currency with which everything runs in the Ethereum (Ether\u2019s price as on 26th Jan. 2018 at 8.50 hrs (IST) was US$ 1,066.59 \u2014 https://etherscan.io/stat/supply ). The main reason why people fulfill their end of the bargain in a contract is that they are incentivized to collect Ether.Ether is the second most valuable Crypto currency after Bitcoin \u2014 http://coinmarketcap.com/ and http://coinmarketcap.com/currencies... Ethereum\u2019s technology which we briefly mentioned above is what making Ether\u2019s price shoot up as we go ahead.Ether has a lot in common with the famous digital currency Bitcoin. Both are a purely digital store of value and means of exchange that cannot be counterfeited. Both are implemented so that no one can manipulate the currency supply. Both can be transferred around the world, like email, and in a very final way, like cash. Both have value today because users expect them to have value tomorrow, and because they can do things traditional money can\u2019t.It is very important that we have these two things absolutely clear:Smart contracts are how things get done in Ethereum.Ether is the currency that is used in the Ethereum network to do anything.The primary difference between Ethereum and any other cryptocurrency is that it\u2019s not just a currency, it\u2019s an environment. Here anyone can take advantage of the blockchain technology to build their own projects and DAPPS (decentralized applications) through smart contracts.ETH UnitsJust like 1 dollar can be split into 100 cents, and 1 Bitcoin (BTC) can be split into 100,000,000 satoshi. Ethereum too has its own unit naming convention.The smallest unit is a wei and there are 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 of them per ETH. There are also some other intermediate names: Finney, Szabo, Shannon, Babbage, Ada \u2014 all named after people who made significant contributions to fields related to cryptocurrencies or networks.Wei and Ether are the two most common denominations.Image Reference \u2014 https://bitsonblocks.net/Where do I buy Ether?The following sites would help you in buying Ether:https://bittylicious.com/https://shapeshift.io/#/coinshttps://www.coinbase.com/?locale=enhttps://localbitcoins.comhttp://faucetdump.com/ethereumhttps://www.quora.com/Where-can-I-buy-Ethereum-in-IndiaResourcesVideos:What is BlockchainWhat is the Blockchain ?The Block Chain \u2014 The BasicsLinks:Everything you\u2019ve ever wanted to know about Ethereum, patiently explainedWhat is Blockchain Technology?

For a time, learning Ethereum\u2019s native programming language, Solidity, was the natural choice for aspiring blockchain developers. Since blockchain is a relatively new field, Ethereum\u2019s standards and Solidity have emerged as industry standards, giving Ethereum a first mover advantage.More DevelopersAs knowledge of blockchain technology has become more mainstream over the past few years, many companies have started testing it and building proofs of concept that take advantage of the blockchain\u2019s scalability, decentralization, security, and other attributes.As discussed above, a plethora of Ethereum developers is readily available to work on new projects. It is possible to find developers to work on other platforms, or to build a platform, but there are few such developers and they are expensive.Ethereum also has the highest number of developer tools available in its ecosystem. The more Ethereum developers there are, the more the platform gains critical mass and attracts more companies and developers. Savvy blockchain startups want to be compatible with Ethereum and Solidity to encourage developer adoption. This virtuous cycle helps Ethereum maintain its position as the dominant blockchain platform.From a developer\u2019s perspective, there is plenty of work on Ethereum. Learning a new platform is a great addition to a developer\u2019s skill set, but many of them prefer to stick to Ethereum while waiting to see which other platforms become mainstream.Respecting DecentralizationAll blockchain platforms face the \u2018Scalability Trilemma\u2019, in which a blockchain can only stress two of the following three properties: security, decentralization, and scalability.Many emerging challengers to Ethereum have sacrificed decentralization to improve scalability. In accordance with the Scalability Trilemma, increasing transactions per second requires decreasing the number of nodes on the blockchain, which sacrifices decentralization. For example, a network with only 10 nodes will work fast, but you have to trust these nodes indefinitely. This eliminates (or at least significantly reduces) the \u2018trustless\u2019 nature of the blockchain.While certain new blockchain platforms are faster and more scalable than Ethereum, they have fewer nodes and are therefore less decentralized. Since decentralization is at the very essence of blockchain, these newer platforms are similar to regular computer networks rather than distributed, immutable, and public ledgers.For companies and developers, trust in a platform is paramount. For a blockchain, trust comes from distribution of nodes. Ethereum currently has nearly 25,000 reachable nodes around the world, resulting in a trustless ecosystem.Withstanding the Test of TimeA blockchain is most vulnerable to a 51% attack (in which one user takes control of 51% of nodes and can therefore tamper with the blockchain) when it is in its initial stages and has fewer nodes. Since Ethereum is a mature blockchain (active since July 2015) with a large number of nodes, it is less vulnerable to potential 51% attacks than newer blockchains are.Scalability on Ethereum SidechainsIf all of the world\u2019s applications were adapted to run on the blockchain, it would be virtually impossible for them to run on the same one. It would not matter how many transactions per second it could handle. No blockchain could hold that many entities on one chain. Even assuming that it was possible to put all of the world\u2019s applications on one blockchain, it would not be desirable since they would become more vulnerable to attacks.However, Ethereum can be set as the first layer (the main chain), with multiple sidechains connected to it. This setup allows for decentralization from the main chain and scalability from the sidechains without sacrificing security.Since each sidechain is much smaller in scale than the main chain, it is less decentralized. This is acceptable because the sidechain also requires less trust. Anything of value can be moved to the main chain for security, so that cyberattacks on the sidechain layer do not result in significant damage.With the Ethereum main chain providing decentralization and security, developers can execute scalability on the sidechain layer (thereby resolving the Scalability Trilemma to a considerable extent).Industry LeaderToday, Ethereum is reaping the advantages of being a first mover in smart contract and DApp functionality. These advantages include a large number of Solidity developers, a diverse array of developer tools, and a reputation as a trustworthy platform that respects decentralization while withstanding the test of time. Developers can also avoid the Scalability Trilemma and simultaneously provide security, decentralization, and scalability by putting high value items on the Ethereum main chain and using faster but less secure sidechains for scalability.Though Ethereum is the industry leading platform today, blockchain technology is still in its early stages and in a rapidly evolving space. Therefore, it is not clear which platforms will power the next generation of blockchain-enabled internet technology. Newer platforms have the luxury of improving on various aspects of Ethereum or tailoring themselves for specific uses. It is likely that different industries will have different industry-specific blockchain platforms in the future.You can always find the latest by following us:Blockstreet HQ | Twitter | Medium | Soundcloud", "responses": 1, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Ethereum", "Ethereum Blockchain", "Ether", "Bhq Contributors"]}, {"title": "Ethereum\u2019s True Rise Began In October 2015", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@TonySwish/ethereum-s-true-rise-began-in-fall-of-2015-fa3cf04c5e7c?source=search_post", "author_name": "Tony Sakich", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@TonySwish", "publish_date": "2016-02-12", "last_modified_date": "2017-12-07", "readtime": "3.51", "claps": 19, "voters": 19, "content": "Ethereum\u2019s True Rise Began In October 2015Tony SakichFollowFeb 12, 2016 \u00b7 4 min readIn the past few hours I\u2019ve started to see pieces pop up in news outlets and threads discussing Ether\u2019s price increase over the recent days. Many of the reasons postulated included obvious ones like Microsoft\u2019s Azure announcement, R3 as well as the current discord within the Bitcoin community. These are all pieces of the puzzle, but it\u2019s become very apparent that there were many other factors that fell into place that aren\u2019t being discussed.The very first factor was Augur\u2019s crowdsale raising over $5 Million Dollars in an extremely bear market (full disclosure, I am on the Augur team). However important this was, it was just the beginning that set the tone and helped build to what has happened in the past few days. The events that occurred in November would be responsible for perpetuating the momentum that Augur created with it\u2019s campaign.The dates where everything crystalized from my perspective were November 9th until the 13th, those of course being the dates of DEVCON1, the Ethereum-focused conference in London.On a personal note, I didn\u2019t get a chance to attend the conference (although I was invited by Vitalik to give one of the few non-dev-centric talks). Not attending was a huge regret, although I feel fortunate that I was able to experience this amazing event at home with a killer livestream.Microsoft\u2019s Azure announcement kicked off the event, something that really set the tone for what was to come, fortunately things actually got better from there. It was the day of project presentations that blew me away. The quality level of each 20 minute presentation was consistently high, something that I hadn\u2019t seen at any of the recent Bitcoin-centric conferences. So many of these projects were fresh ideas by brilliant individuals, for many it was the very first time the world saw what they were working on and damn were they impressive. These projects illustrated the depth of developer interest in this project, clearly demonstrating that the interest was much higher on Ethereum than any other similar blockchain. This was a day where I was blown away by something in this community for this first time in a long time, what blew me away was the talent and ideas this technology can enable.The conference\u2019s contributions to the current rise of Ether\u2019s market value didn\u2019t stop there. Of course Vitalik\u2019s talk was incredible as he has a charsima and charm that is hard not to find infectious (he\u2019s also a great guy in every interaction I have had with him, something I value equally as much as his brilliance). It then came to the keynote speaker, the grand slam \u201cget\u201d of any convention, Nick Szabo. Szabo\u2019s influence no doubt opened some eyes and got attention, especially as he chose this conference over the multitudes of others.There was one more unannounced guest, that being musician Imogen Heap. She wasn\u2019t just there to add name value, but she appeared at the end of Vinay Gupta\u2019s talk and quickly discussed the her Ethereum project, Mycelia. Imogen\u2019s presence brought attention to the conference from outlets that would never be interested in such a thing. It was the perfect way to end such a monumental event.The BBC were filming and my brilliant Augur teammate Dr. Jack Peterson did a fantastic explanation of the technology, one that I am extremely jealous of as it was eloquent and perfect.This event happened in November, I raved about it at the time of the event and decided it would now be a good time to put these pieces back together to highlight the other, underreported aspects that helped to get to this point.The phrase I keep using this week is that I can\u2019t begin to express how much fun I\u2019m having right now. Seeing the market respond to the amazing things that Ethereum has been involved with in the past few months is just exciting and rewarding as hell.I sincerely hope that this attention helps shine a spotlight on some of the projects in development that aren\u2019t the big dogs which get tons of press. One place I would encourage everyone from newbies to veteran community members to check out is the wonderful \u201cState of the Dapps\u201d page which highlights 149 projects that are currently in development on Ethereum.Some of the Ethereum Dapps featured on \u201cState of the Dapps\u201dThese projects deserve attention and I have a feeling we are in the beginning of a new phase where some will get this attention.

Inspired by Y Combinator\u2019s \u201cSimple Agreement for Future Equity\u201d, the SAFT standardizes the legal framework surrounding token issuance and governs the nature of the transactions involved (i.e. the deployment of capital and distribution of tokens).The complex legal environment surrounding tokens, especially in the US, has led many entrepreneurs to choose to leave Silicon Valley because they can develop the technology better elsewhere. Those who remain in the US have had to compromise on the optimization of their models in order to comply with legacy regulatory frameworks. Recognising these limitations, and seeking to mature the ecosystem beyond such models, several interested parties (including Protocol Labs, AngelList and CoinCenter) have worked together to create standard legal agreements for this novel asset class.Essentially, a SAFT represents a promise for future tokens at a fixed price. The agreement can be structured so that investors receive these tokens when the network launches, or with inbuilt vesting to incentivise continued support by investors.The development of the SAFT model involved consultations with foremost legal experts at the intersection of cryptocurrencies, securities law and regulatory compliance. By simplifying token issuance and the requisite compliance concerns, it provides an essential bridging of the gap between current technological progress and future regulation.protocol.aitwitter.com/protocollabstwitter.com/juanbenettwitter.com/jesseclayburghpolychain.capitalangel.co/polychain-capitaltwitter.com/ryanzurrerconsensys.netconsensysmedia.nethttps://itunes.apple.com//podcast/the-ether-review/id899090462?mt=2", "responses": 1, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Fintech", "Ethereum", "Podcast", "Bitcoin"]}, {"title": "Etheremon: \u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u7684\u4ee5\u592a\u5c0f\u602a\u517d\u4e16\u754c\u3002", "post_link": "https://medium.com/etheremon/%E4%BB%A5%E5%A4%AA%E5%AE%9D%E8%B4%9D-%E5%8E%BB%E4%B8%AD%E5%BF%83%E5%8C%96%E7%9A%84%E4%BB%A5%E5%A4%AA%E5%85%BD%E4%B8%96%E7%95%8C-6b255949bdeb?source=search_post", "author_name": "Etheremon", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@myetheremon", "publish_date": "2017-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2018-04-29", "readtime": "11.7", "claps": 190, "voters": 17, "content": "Etheremon: \u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u7684\u4ee5\u592a\u5c0f\u602a\u517d\u4e16\u754c\u3002EtheremonFollowDec 26, 2017 \u00b7 12 min readEtheremon\u662f\u4e00\u6b3e\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee5\u592a\u574a\uff08Ethereum\uff09\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u6e38\u620f\u6a21\u62df\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ee5\u592a\u5c0f\u602a\u517d\uff08etheremon\uff09\u7684\u4e16\u754c\uff0c\u73a9\u5bb6\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4e16\u754c\u91cc\u6355\u6349\uff0c\u4ea4\u6613\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5c0f\u602a\u517d\uff0c\u4e5f\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u8fdb\u5316\u4e4b\u540e\u6d3e\u5b83\u4eec\u4e0e\u5bf9\u624b\u6218\u6597\u3002\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u6b3e\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u4eba\u53ef\u4ee5\u63a7\u5236etheremon\u4e16\u754c\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e0d\u5141\u8bb8\u4f7f\u7528\u5916\u6302\u4f5c\u5f0a\u3002\u5b83\u662f\u4e0d\u53d7\u4efb\u4f55\u5916\u90e8\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u6267\u884c\u7684\u53ea\u662fEtheremon\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u5408\u7ea6\u4e2d\u9884\u5148\u7f16\u5199\u597d\u7684\u6761\u6b3e\uff08\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u5df2\u5f97\u5230\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u516c\u4f17\u53ef\u81ea\u884c\u67e5\u9605\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u5207\u90fd\u662f\u900f\u660e\u7684\uff09\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u4ee5\u592a\u574a\u5728\u6210\u5343\u4e0a\u4e07\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4e0a\u540c\u65f6\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u63d0\u4f9b\u5177\u6709100%\u4e0a\u7ebf\u65f6\u95f4\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002\u518d\u8005\uff0c\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u51fa\u552e\u548c\u4ea4\u6613\u60a8\u7684etheremon\uff0c\u5c31\u50cf\u4efb\u4f55\u4f20\u7edf\u6536\u85cf\u54c1\u4e00\u6837\u3002\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u6536\u85cf\u54c1\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u5728Etheremon\u4e16\u754c\u91cc\uff0c\u73a9\u5bb6\u53ef\u4ee5\u8bad\u7ec3\u81ea\u5df1\u7684Etheremon\uff0c\u6218\u80dc\u5176\u4ed6\u5bf9\u624b\u5e76\u8d5a\u53d6EMONT\uff08\u4e00\u79cdERC-20\u4ee3\u5e01\uff09\u30021. \u6e38\u620f\u6982\u5ff5\u730e\u517d\u4eba\uff08\u6307\u7684\u662f\u6e38\u620f\u73a9\u5bb6\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0e\u4ee5\u592a\u574a\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0a\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u5408\u7ea6\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u5982\u4e0b\u4e09\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\uff1a\u6355\u83b7Etheremons\u6765\u5b8c\u5584\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u6536\u85cf\uff0cEtheremons\u662f\u5728\u4ee5\u592a\u574a\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0a\u53d1\u5e03\u7684\u6709\u9650\u865a\u62df\u5c0f\u602a\u517d\u3002\u8bad\u7ec3Etheremons\u751f\u86cb\uff0c\u5c06\u5b83\u4eec\u8f6c\u5316\u6210\u65b0\u7684\u7269\u79cd\u6765\u51fa\u552e\u6216\u51fa\u501f\u7ed9\u5176\u4ed6\u7684\u730e\u517d\u4eba\u3002\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08\u5355\u4eba\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5206\u7ec4\u6a21\u5f0f\u6216\u9526\u6807\u8d5b\uff09\u4e2d\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u730e\u517d\u4eba\u5bf9\u6218\u6765\u6536\u96c6EMONT\uff08\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4f5c\u6e38\u620f\u5185\u8d27\u5e01\u7684ERC-20\u4ee3\u5e01\uff09\u30022.

Break Record Value despite $30M HackThe $30 Million Tether HackBest of ICOsFollowNov 30, 2017 \u00b7 4 min readIntroLast week, the price of Ethereum increased by over 35% to a record high of $490 USD, and Bitcoin crossed $11000 USD, also a record high. The same week, Tether was hacked for $30 million dollars, which had a few very important effects on the cryptocurrency ecosystem. The Tether hack is larger in scope than just the $30 million that was hacked and we will explain how these events are related. Furthermore we\u2019ll explore how this hack happened, and the results of it.Here is what we know:Bitfinex is currently one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges on the market, and they are the sole source of the Tether cryptocurrency (though they\u2019re ambiguous about their involvement with it). Tether is unique in that it is pegged to the US dollar which makes it a requirement that Bitfinex/Tether co have the financial capital to back every Tether they issue.Bitfinex was cut off from the US banks in early 2017 (with a large lawsuit involving Wells Fargo), which makes it impossible for them to clear USD-denominated wires. However, they still have clients who have collectively deposited about $400M with them.For this reason, in order to get US dollars they issued a cryptocurrency called Tether which is claimed to be 100% backed by USD and furthermore say that it is redeemable 1-to-1 for US dollars. That said, they do not mention that there is no way to trade it directly with USD.Somehow this has worked for Bitfinex so far and they have issued approximately $600M USD in Tethers, with over 90% of them issued in the last 6 months, even though they have no access to USD banks, and since April 2017 their Taiwanese bank also froze their accounts which further sheds doubt on their ability to clear their liabilities. They\u2019re tradable on other exchanges for different cryptocurrencies (primarily BTC and ETH).The HackOn Nov 21st Tether claimed that someone had stolen 5% ($30 million) of their $600 million Tethers. In short, someone got careless and keys were compromised \u2014 The digital claims, not the underlying dollars sitting in the bank account that supposedly holds the backing USD by getting a hold of the private keys of the underlying contract. They\u2019ve made a technical change to their client to disallow transactions on the stolen tokens, but there is no guarantee that they succeed in convincing all other exchanges to honour this change. There is no explicit information about how the thieves got these keys.This is very problematic for Tether and Bitfinex since if any of the exchanges say they have no incentive to apply the patch, instead they actually require Tether to have the backing money. So either they prove they have a way to release the backing money or they\u2019ll be delisted. Bitfinex cares about Tether being listed on other exchanges because they need to exchange the money to support their exchange business. Tethers are institutionalizing pseudo-crypto-Liberty Reserve, allowing the physical transfer of real money to happen in an area of legal remoteness to the cryptocurrency exchange.If they are delisted, the thief will immediately withdraw everything to Bitcoin, and suddenly 30 million hacked Tethers are now in the money stream at the exchange, and cannot be conveniently distinguished from clean (non-hacked) Tethers. This will probably lead to large withdrawals from the exchange similar to a bank run, eliminating all liquidity from bitfinex.ConclusionThe reason this is all tied to the price rise in ETH and BTC is that this large withdrawal scenario will lead to massive buys of both BTC and ETH. If you don\u2019t believe Bitfinex\u2019s $600 million in liabilities are actually backed by US funds and aren\u2019t worth a copper shilling, the only option for getting your value out of Bitfinex is to swap your liability for Bitcoin (or Ether), which drives up the price of Bitcoin at the margin.This is exactly what happened in the final months of Mt. Gox, which was bankrupt in 2014, even though the previous year they were handling most of the Bitcoin transactions, a huge warning sign which should be well heeded by everyone in the cryptocurrency community.Let this be a cautionary tale about keeping keys in unsafe environments, and the trust people have in stable tokens. With both ETH and BTC at an all-time-high we are looking forward to the development of this news.Looking to help?Support us on Bountey! https://www.bountey.com/bestoficosWant to stay up to date in ICOs?

Bitcoin To Hit $25,000 This Year?Miner OneFollowApr 23, 2018 \u00b7 4 min readBitcoin\u2019s and ether\u2019s first quarter \u201cslump\u201d (if that\u2019s what being up eight-to-eleven-fold compared to the same time last year can be called) left many crypto enthusiasts disappointed. Seems the end-of-2017 run-up created such high expectations that enthusiasts were bound to be disappointed by any significant market adjustment.Perhaps it\u2019s the nature of such markets for new and promising things that enthusiasm often leads to euphoria which, in turn, can abruptly end for no apparent reason, resulting in what are sometimes dizzying \u201ccorrections\u201d like the one early this year.The good news this week is that, after falling below US $370 earlier this month, ether has made a significant recovery and is now trading comfortably above $600. Though it still has a ways to go to reach January\u2019s heights, the recovery shows the potential for ether to move further upward, with some experts predicting it may, in time, overtake bitcoin in terms of market capitalisation.Bitcoin also seems to have found its footing, flirting with $9,000 this week, with further growth expected over the long run as smart investors continue to \u201cbuy the dips\u201d, institutional investors move off the sidelines, and interest in the world\u2019s most popular cryptocurrency continues to grow.Whether doldrums or rally, there is good reason to be enthusiastic about cryptocurrencies and the blockchain technology at their heart. Both have the potential to revolutionise the way business is conducted and data and value are stored and managed online. That\u2019s probably why experts remain upbeat about ether and bitcoin over the long run, though sometimes dramatic price swings can be expected to continue. Clearly, speculative investing in cryptocurrencies is not a game for the risk-averse.Read on to find out what experts are saying and where Miner One fits in.Post-Tax Day Recovery Appears To Be In ProgressThomas Lee, head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, has famously been predicting bitcoin will go to $20,000 by mid-year and $25,000 by year\u2019s end. He is sticking to those predictions, first quarter results notwithstanding.Spencer Bogart, a partner at Blockchain Capital, is similarly bullish. Commenting on prospects for a bitcoin recovery, Bogart recently told the CNBC it would be \u201cvery easy\u201d for bitcoin to surpass last year\u2019s highs this year and that selling pressures will ease once crypto holders have paid their taxes on last year\u2019s gains.Marshall Taplits, chief strategy officer for NYNJA, an international mobile communications application with an on-demand marketplace and cryptocurrency ecosystem, is confident the current phase is temporary:\u201cSpeculation on price is always difficult, but the trend for bitcoin is clear \u2014 up, going to about $20,000 from zero in 10 years. Each time bitcoin corrects, the media wrenches. However, anyone who has been watching cryptocurrency since the beginning knows to bet on $30,000,\u201d he said to Forbes in early April.Daniel Worsley, chief operating officer at LocalCoinSwap, is thinking along similar lines. He says bitcoin could rise above $20,000 this year. Worsley is confident that a healthy dollop of good news will propel the crypto market:\u201cGiven the amount of negative press which is now priced in and investor expectation of another bull run, it will only take a couple of positive developments to set off the train,\u201d he believes.Institutional Money Will Play a RoleOne such positive development is the growing interest of major market players. In recent weeks news has circulated that George Soros, the Rockefeller family, and others are looking to get into crypto. Soros, who earlier this year called bitcoin a bubble, has approved cryptocurrency trading by his New York-based Soros Fund Management.According to media reports, the Rockefellers are also getting in on the act. Venrock, a venture capital firm backed by the Rockefeller family, has partnered with crypto investment group Coinfund to support cryptocurrency and blockchain business innovation.How soon and how extensively these big fish get involved remains to be seen, but their growing interest indicates they understand that cryptocurrency is here to stay. Given this fact, supporting the blockchain network on which it is based will always be necessary\u2026and profitable if done professionally.That is where Miner One comes in.Miner One: The Simple Plan for Bitcoin ProfitabilityThe Miner One vision is simple and profit-oriented.

What It Could Mean for Miner OneMiner OneFollowMay 11, 2018 \u00b7 3 min readReddit\u2019s co-founder Alex Ohanian recently made a bullish statement about ether \u2014 the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation. He is confident that ether\u2019s price will rise faster than the price of bitcoin, climbing to $1,500 by the end of the year. Meanwhile, Ohanian thinks bitcoin is just warming up to hit last year\u2019s record.\u201cAt the end of the year, Bitcoin will be at $20,000. And Ethereum will be at $1,500 [Ohanian was originally quoted saying $15,000, but later said he misspoke and meant to say $1,500]. Great, now people can call me out if I\u2019m wrong,\u201d he said to Fortune magazine\u2019s Term Sheet last week.According to Ohanian, the value of ether derives from applications built on the Ethereum blockchain.\u201cI\u2019m most bullish about Ethereum simply because people are actually building on it,\u201d he said. Ethereum is the platform of choice for several blockchain applications, including Cryptokitties, a blockchain-based game that went viral last year. Major firms, including giant investment bank J.P. Morgan are also testing technology based on Ethereum.Ohanian himself is leading by example and investing in cryptocurrency. Having stepped away from Reddit\u2019s day-to-day operations, Ohanian manages his venture capital firm Initialized Capital, which has more than $250 million assets under management and has invested in Coinbase, a major cryptocurrency exchange.In an interview with Fortune he said that blockchain projects built using the Ethereum platform will continue to grow in popularity as more professionals who know a thing or two about usability, user experience, and wider application are joining early adopters and engineers. He mentioned seeing more teams with business and product backgrounds that are moving to start or join blockchain projects.As for Reddit, one of the oldest cryptocurrency forums online, the company recently announced plans to reintroduce bitcoin payments on the platform after halting them in March, and to add more crypto options in the near future. \u201dWe are looking at Ethereum and Litecoin that are both provided by Coinbase,\u201d Chris Slowe, Reddit\u2019s CTO, told the technology-focused news source Cheddar.Can Ether Go Even Higher?Nigel Green, CEO of deVere Group, recently predicted an even bigger future for the cryptocurrency, saying ether could hit $2,500 and make 2018 a record-setting year.\u201cLooking at the market activity right now, I believe that cryptocurrencies are set for another considerable surge in price gains in the short-term, and Ethereum\u2019s price could reach $2,500 by the end of 2018,\u201d he stated on his website.Seemingly, the best is yet to come for the world\u2019s second most valuable cryptocurrency.What Does This Mean for the Miner One Community?Belief in ether\u2019s eventual recovery from its spring slump was the reason the Miner One Community voted in April to delay ordering mining equipment. With ether already up significantly (and mining equipment prices continuing to fall), the Community\u2019s decision appears to have been the right one. Now, the time is ripe to place that first order and set up Miner One\u2019s first mining facility. The more ether climbs over the next month or two, the farther the funds raised in ether during Miner One\u2019s ICO will go towards covering set up expenses.Once mining commences this July, to minimise transaction costs, Miner One payouts will be distributed in ether using Ethereum-based smart contracts. Miner One MIO Token Holders will have the option of either exchanging or \u201cHODLing\u201d that ether. That second option might be the better one, if Green and Ohanian are correct!", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Blockchain"]}, {"title": "Etherisc is developing an insurable multisig wallet", "post_link": "https://blog.etherisc.com/etherisc-is-developing-an-insurable-multisig-wallet-icw-28e96f79610f?source=search_post", "author_name": "Etherisc", "author_link": "https://blog.etherisc.com/@etherisc", "publish_date": "2017-12-14", "last_modified_date": "2018-08-28", "readtime": "3.11", "claps": 113, "voters": 15, "content": "Etherisc is developing an insurable multisig walletEtheriscFollowDec 14, 2017 \u00b7 4 min readInsurable multisig wallets could be an important factor for mass adoption of crypto currencies.The recent Parity debacle, in which around $150 million worth of ether has been frozen, has laid bare the fact that smart contract security is still in its early stages and in much need of development. Security flaws in smart contracts are not a lone issue for individual projects, and the lack of safety is one of the primary reasons blocking mass adoption of crypto. But that\u2019s about to change.Our value propositionEtherisc is developing a specification for an insurable multisig wallet based on Ethereum to tackle this problem. Although still in its concept phase, our product will have several vital features:Storage for ether and other tokens based on the ERC-20 standard.Super-safe \u2014 both for keeping assets and handling.It is designed to be insurable \u2014 users will be able to insure assets stored in such a wallet, even large amounts.A secure super-safe wallet has two aspects:First, the wallet\u2019s code is only a part of a larger secure design. Such design includes all angles; from a secure solidity wallet to the way critical situations, like a private key being lost or compromised, are handled and resolved.Second, development process must be state of the art. It should contain a detailed specification and a thoroughly structured fault identification mechanism. By using systematic measures failures can be avoided and detected, plus these measures can be additionally enhanced with provable verification and validation activities. This kind of process usually consists of several phases:Concept phase (the phase we\u2019re currently in).Development phase.Systematic analysis phase.Validation and verification phase.Unlike complex existing solutions, the first insurable wallet\u2019s design uses only a minimal subset of the available technology, so the result will be easy to audit, test and verify. Etherisc will also work on a formal verification for all of the wallet\u2019s parts, while the operating environment will exclude or minimise human errors with the use of, e.g. \u201cpoka-yoke\u201d patterns (processes designed with poka-yoke patterns support the user in avoiding common mistakes).And just like every line of code that comes from under our fingers, our reference implementation and development process will be open source. This way both can be auditable and improved by the community. Of course, Etherisc\u2019s insurable wallet is not the only possible version by far. That\u2019s why we\u2019re inviting the developer community to come up with alternative implementations and share their thoughts on how to bring this approach to a higher and more robust level.As soon as the first specification is stable and accepted by insurance carriers, other wallet iterations could in principle become insurable as well, if they follow the specification. We hope to see many different implementations of insurable wallets!Strong interest pouring inNot only individual users, custodians and institutional investors are left out in the cold too when it comes to a usable and safe solution for storing crypto funds. That\u2019s why the reinsurance industry is already showing significant interest in our product because it will provide them with a decent risk diversification.Our proposal is available on github and a valuable discussion has already started. At the same time we are talking to insurance specialists and reinsurances, which will provide the coverage for the policies we will write.The plan is to start out with a small group of projects, and then gradually expand the product\u2019s user numbers to mass adoption.To learn more or be a part of the Etherisc community, please join the discussion in our Telegram chat and follow us on Twitter, LinkedIn, and Medium.We are organizing the second Decentralized Insurance Developer Conference in Prague on October 29.

Though it still has a way to go to reach January\u2019s heights, it appears poised to move further upward in the weeks ahead, with some experts predicting it may overtake bitcoin in terms of market capitalisation.\u201cEthereum is a general-purpose scripting blockchain founded by one of the greatest minds of our generation. As the foundation for hundreds of other mainstream cryptocurrencies, Ethereum has the potential to one day rival bitcoin itself,\u201d Nathan Worsley, CTO of LocalCoinSwap, tells Forbes.Such bullish prognoses are backed by a recent survey of blockchain industry participants conducted by comparison website Finder (in March). Participants not only expect that, by year\u2019s end, the price of ether will be US $2,550 (and bitcoin \u2014 $29,000), they expect ether\u2019s market capitalisation to grow faster than bitcoin\u2019s (212 v. 194 percent). Expectations like these, writes CCN, are driven by ether\u2019s versatility and the growing number of initial coin offerings (ICOs) using the Ethereum blockchain. ICOs remain a popular method for blockchain and fintech companies to raise funds.Since the number of ICOs launching on the Ethereum network is rapidly growing and is expected to continue to grow, it seems only a question of time before ether moves further upward, as well.Where Does Miner One Fit In?Naturally, the recent crypto dip could not but impact Miner One \u2014 coming, as it did, in the middle of its ICO. Funds are being raised in bitcoin, ether, and litecoin as well as euro.Miner One was prepared to start purchasing mining equipment in April. On April 1 ETH hit its lowest price of the year, then on April 6 fell even a bit lower. Following a survey of MIO Token Holders, a decision was made not to rush purchases during such a downturn. A majority supported the idea of giving ETH time to rebound before committing to major purchases. It now appears their patience is paying off.On the plus side, the crypto dip has led to significant decreases in the prices of ASIC miners \u2014 the specialised hardware needed to mine bitcoin. If ether\u2019s recovery can be sustained, the timing may be just right for Miner One to make a move within the next few weeks.For investors, conditions could hardly be better. Not only are Miner One\u2019s MIO Ethereum-based ERC20 tokens. For the duration of the Crowdsale, MIOs are priced in ether. This means until the Crowdsale ends May 15th, the price of MIO moves in tandem with ETH relative to fiat currencies like USD and EUR. Ether\u2019s downturn since the beginning of the Crowdsale has created particularly favourable conditions for those investing in euro right now, and Miner One is seeing a lot of people taking advantage of this informal \u201cdiscount\u201d lately.That said, these conditions appear unlikely to persist. Those waiting for the best deals probably shouldn\u2019t wait any longer. With major investors reportedly about to get into crypto markets, right now seems to be the time to \u201cbuy the dip\u201d.Meanwhile, MIO Token Holders in general have even more reasons to be upbeat: bitcoin seems to have found its footing and awareness of Ethereum\u2019s usefulness is growing, powering ether\u2019s recovery. Analysts remain bullish about both. With discounts ending and only four weeks left in the Crowdsale, there may not be a better time to invest in Miner One.", "responses": 1, "tags": ["Ethereum"]}, {"title": "TradeRiser Referral Scheme \u2014 Earn 10% In ETH (Ether)", "post_link": "https://medium.com/traderiser/traderiser-referral-scheme-earn-10-in-eth-ether-231531f8945?source=search_post", "author_name": "TradeRiser", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@traderiser", "publish_date": "2018-04-30", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-21", "readtime": "1.61", "claps": 19, "voters": 9, "content": "TradeRiser Referral Scheme \u2014 Earn 10% In ETH (Ether)TradeRiserFollowApr 30, 2018 \u00b7 2 min readHi Community!Join our Community Referral Rewards Campaign!We have reserved a total amount of $200,000 worth of XTI tokens for the TradeRiser Community Referral Rewards campaign and $500,000 worth of ETH.

The DAO is very slowly leaking EtherJake BrukhmanFollowJun 7, 2016 \u00b7 2 min readToday, The DAO tokens are trading on exchanges below the value of the Ether that underlies them. This creates more than an 8% spread between DAO tokens and the Ether being held in The DAO\u2019s smart contract. As /u/eeksskee points, out this is quite an opportunity for arbitrage.The process is that a trader can head over to ShapeShift and instantaneously purchase, say, 10000 DAO at 91.766 ETH. Then \u2014 over the course of 48 days and with significant technical sophistication \u2014 they may split from the DAO and recover the underlying funds of 100 ETH, thus generating a near-riskless return.Interestingly, though this opportunity is now well known, only 47 split proposals have been extended at the time of writing, and it is difficult to tell which are performing arbitrage. Yet, for sophisticated users an 8% spread could be a compelling return level and once the process is proven out (~40 days from now, the first of the split proposals should be completing their Ether recovery phases), we could see a much higher demand for DAO token arbitrage.This morning the BTC/DAO market on Poloniex alone would have supported approximately $800K in underpriced DAO token liquidity, and if completely arbitraged could theoretically produce a ~$880K outflow from The DAO contract. Today, this represents about 0.5% of The DAO\u2019s holdings.It seems that as long as holders consider splitting a technologically insurmountable or even just annoyingly complicated obstacle, they will be willing to pay a non-zero spread for Ether recovery. Thus, for the foreseeable future there will be a small but significant economic pressure to cleave off pieces of The DAO for risk-less returns.By analogy to Stephen Hawking\u2019s black hole mass shedding, would it be fair to call this phenomenon \u201cJentzsch Radiation\u201d?This phenomenon should not necessarily concern DAO token holders, but it is an interesting example of markets at work and how latent economic pressures spur market agents into action.Addendum (6/9/2016): Please also check out \u201cTheDAO Should Perform Arbitrage By Buying Back Tokens\u201d, a proposal to add buyback code to the Standard DAO Framework which economically extinguishes \u201cJentzsch Radiation\u201d and offers a compelling innovation on real-world closed investment funds (via CoinFund Slack).", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Ethereum"]}, {"title": "The Ether Review #68 \u2014 Numerai, The Last Hedge Fund", "post_link": "https://etherreview.info/the-ether-review-68-numerai-the-last-hedge-fund-d0af110b7d42?source=search_post", "author_name": "Arthur Falls", "author_link": "https://etherreview.info/@arthurfalls", "publish_date": "2017-07-06", "last_modified_date": "2018-01-31", "readtime": "0.72", "claps": 19, "voters": 17, "content": "The Ether Review #68 \u2014 Numerai, The Last Hedge FundArthur FallsFollowJul 6, 2017 \u00b7 1 min readXander Dunn and Richard Craib discuss Numerai, a new kind of hedge fund built by a network of data scientists.The Numerai platform crowdsources machine learning by releasing encrypted data sets to data scientists, incentivising them to develop machine learning algorithms to analyse the data.

Sether received a great review, so we decided to address it with this article, and to thank the reviewer at the same time, for the help to clear up these important aspects.1. We got more than a tiny bit of help from TinybowlIn a razor sharp blog, 4 clever analysts from Tinybowl inspect the Sether White Paper, reaching a sullen verdict: it\u2019s unclear.You can read the article here.

That\u2019s because Sether is a Business to Business platform. We offer a programmatic social media marketing platform that businesses can use to promote their products, organize campaigns, motivate or find new customers. All of this will be powered up by our tokens. Hence, we view the Sether ICO first of all as a business to business proposition, and only secondly as an investment opportunity to individual users.We are selling our tokens in a sale to incentivize and to promote working with the platform, not to raise money to have it done. Until now, we focused to deliver this message to companies, for our preICO campaign. From now on, you will find a section on the site explaining the advantages of investing in SETH tokens, in regard to the coming ICO crowdsale period.3.

We commit ourselves to making this platform happen, and to offer operational value to the SETH Token. It is our promise to any businesses that invests in preICO SETH Tokens, but sure, it means something to any ICO Token buyer.It means we are here to stay, and that our Token will rise, not because it was all sold in the sale, but because with it you\u2019ll make successful campaigns, bounties and promotions happen.So, yes, this project does not need your investment to get made.

Red-flagging our softcap lack as an investment risk only leaves up investing in Kickstarter-like ventures, that totally depend on the funds being gathered. The way we see it is like this: if your idea is so good, why not get a loan and finance it yourself? Before you ask people to see it as an investment, you should properly invest in it yourself.4. We set the right hardcap for a hardcore platform\u201c[\u2026], there is a huge hardcap. If it is reached it would mean valuating the tokens (not even the company) (they sell 50% for a hardcap of 165,000 ether, currently all tokens would be 132M USD in value).\u201d\u201cThat approach to software engineering is not adequate for innovation. The rationale behind this is \u201clet\u2019s get as much money as possible so we can hire a workforce as large as possible to finish this\u201d.The success of our platform, and the value of our Tokens have no relation to our ICO reaching the hardcap. That\u2019s not how this works. The hardcap simply prevents dilution. We chose such a high hardcap as a precaution, to make sure we do not fall short in case we need to sell massive Token amounts.In order to understand this high cost, though, you have to take into account that the more our clients will use the platform, the more tech we will need to buy. So, to keep innovating, we need to add more and more tech, it\u2019s not the workforce that will rise costs. Luckily, we have our Big Data experience to guide us through the development of this platform.5. This is Not The Wolf Of Wall Street\u201c- What are the consequences of this?- As investor, I do not know how much am I paying for what percent of the tokens. That is, if I put 1 eth, what percent of property (of tokens) do I have. It is blind investment. Also, not having a hard cap and claiming that they would do the project anyway means that they do not need my investment, so they are just using a good opportunity to get additional funds to try to do a faster development.\u201dBuying a token in an ICO does not grant you a percent of the company. ICOs are not like IPOs, and this is a general rule for all ICOs. At the end of the crowdsale you get to know what percent you own of the total amount of tokens. It\u2019s impossible to know beforehand. All ICOs that burn unsold tokens at the end of the crowdsale operate in the same way, it\u2019s not particular to SETHER. This is an advantage for investors, as opposed to ICOs that don\u2019t burn the tokens and end up selling only a small amount. They will have a huge mass of tokens with little to no value, and investors will indeed know beforehand what percent they will own, but they will end up having a known percent of almost nothing, if the crowdsale does not succeed.ICOs that are burning tokens (or minting them) guarantee that unsold tokens will be destroyed (or not generated in case of minting). This means that the shares of the investors and the company maintain the original proportions.If you invest 1 ETH and you are the only one who will invest, at the end of the crowdsale, your 1 ETH will entitle you to 40% of all SETH tokens available.6. We\u2019re launching Sether Alpha\u201c- They may succeed, but the risk does not match the reward. Particularly with that ridiculously high valuation of a software that does not exist. \u2014 If the software does not even have a prototype (they only have a proposed API definition), the team is good but not world class, there are not pre-existing clients, no strategic partners\u2026 I have to agree, the valuation is not correct. I am out\u201dHaving no pre-existing clients and no strategic partners is how any business is at the beginning, and stands as part of the reason for our ICO. To overcome this as soon as possible, we sped up the development of the Alpha version of Sether, and we managed to launch it sooner than expected. You can check it out on www.sether.io. We are currently making arrangements with several businesses to help us test the platform. We will release all the details about the test.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Blockchain", "ICO", "Investing", "Altcoins", "Ethereum"]}, {"title": "The Ether Review #73 \u2014 Kik, Establishing a Micro-economy", "post_link": "https://etherreview.info/the-ether-review-73-kik-establishing-a-micro-economy-5ca6821ba679?source=search_post", "author_name": "Arthur Falls", "author_link": "https://etherreview.info/@arthurfalls", "publish_date": "2017-10-04", "last_modified_date": "2018-05-03", "readtime": "1.17", "claps": 33, "voters": 6, "content": "The Ether Review #73 \u2014 Kik, Establishing a Micro-economyArthur FallsFollowOct 4, 2017 \u00b7 2 min readToday we hear from Ted Livingston, who founded Kik interactive in 2009 to address the problem of chat between blackberry, android and iPhone. Since then their chat app, Kik, has exploded in popularity, experiencing use by up to 40% of US teenagers.In 2015 Tencent, the builder of Chinese chat giant Wechat, purchased a 5% stake in the company at a Billion dollar valuation. A move that some are saying has anointed Kik as the Wechat of the west. It\u2019s interesting to see the youth focus with One Direction leading their award winning marketing campaign of 2014 .Kik is a somewhat anonymous platform, with it\u2019s own economy in which stickers are traded and users can be charged for access to certain chat rooms.By launching the Kik in-app currency, Kin, as a cryptocurrency, Kik interactive aims to enable the Kik micro-economy to grow independently and organically. The Token launch ended recently with nearly one hundred million USD equivalent raised. No surprises there. What is interesting is that registered contributors numbered over 10,000 and resided in over 100 countries, indicating that the currency is indeed broadly distributed compared to other tokens. Though, my guess is it\u2019s concentrated in the hands of speculators, rather than the 15 million community participants.This episode was recorded over two months ago so it\u2019s interesting to look back from the other side of the Token Launch and see Ted\u2019s claims of broad distribution validated.kin.kik.comconsensys.netconsensysmedia.netetherreview.infohttps://itunes.apple.com//podcast/the-ether-review/id899090462?mt=2", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Bitcoin", "Ethereum", "Blockchain", "Podcast", "Fintech"]}, {"title": "The Ether Review #76 \u2014 Attores & Indorse, Smart Contracts as a Service", "post_link": "https://etherreview.info/the-ether-review-76-attores-smart-contracts-as-a-service-a1334450a1b?source=search_post", "author_name": "Arthur Falls", "author_link": "https://etherreview.info/@arthurfalls", "publish_date": "2017-10-17", "last_modified_date": "2018-04-13", "readtime": "0.58", "claps": 18, "voters": 8, "content": "The Ether Review #76 \u2014 Attores & Indorse, Smart Contracts as a ServiceArthur FallsFollowOct 17, 2017 \u00b7 1 min readThe founders of Attores, Gorang Torvekar and David Moskowitz discuss their notion of \u201csmart contracts as a service\u201d.The platform is currently being piloted by nanyang polytechnic in Singapore as a digital diploma registry.

In a minute span of 2 years, 19 year old Vitalik Buterin\u2019s brainchild has risen up from the pile of over 1,300 cryptocurrencies in existence. Before you rush to get some for yourself, here are some things about Ethereum you should know:HistoryIn the 2008 white paper published by Satoshi Nakamoto, the blockchain was described as a public ledger to record transactions on a decentralised network. This ledger would verify and record every transaction on the network. Ethereum, 7 years later, became the brain-child of this very concept.giphyIn 2013, 19- year-old Vitalik Buterin laid out his plan that indicated that blockchains had a wider applicability, and were not limited to just financial transactions. In his white paper, he stated that a blockchain system could facilitate all sorts of \u2018decentralised applications.\u2019Vitalk programmed Ethereum to be a customisable blockchain according to the needs of its users. This was based on Smart Contracts \u2014 computer programs that execute transactions on their own, on conditions agreed upon by users.Ethereum creator Vitalik ButerinButerin wanted to establish Ethereum as an evolved cryptocurrency, which would not only facilitate transactions for currencies, but also other specific actions. For example, tracking medical data.How does Ethereum work?Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency \u2014 the fuel needed to run processes on its blockchain \u2014 is called Ether. Since ETH is a cryptocurrency, it is decentralised and not controlled by any single governing entity, exactly like Bitcoin. This is in contrast to other online business systems, which have centralised control and are regulated by governing bodies of their countries.The network is dependent on \u2018nodes\u2019 \u2014 individual volunteers all over the globe, who download the entire Ethereum blockchain and fully enforce the consensus rules of the system, vital to its functioning. These \u2018Consensus Rules\u2019 and other aspects of this network are dictated by Smart Contracts, which are designed to perform transactions automatically. These transactions take place between two parties who don\u2019t necessarily trust each other on the network but the terms of fulfilment are pre-specified in the contract.A transaction or any other specific action is generated when these terms of agreement are fulfilled. Running these transactions costs resources \u2014 in Ethereum\u2019s case, Ether (ETH) \u2014 which is traded on cryptocurrency exchanges. Smart Contracts are used because they provide security superior to traditional contract laws, are comparatively cheap, and establish a better trust between the two parties.Uses and applicationsEthereum is a platform to build and run all sorts of decentralised services, or DApps (decentralised applications). One of the major advantages of this system is its wide applicability. Apart from facilitating currency transactions, it also enables users to create decentralised applications on its blockchain. Here are some uses and applications of Ethereum:Security from hackersEthereum, having no centralised server, is very hard for hackers to manipulate. It is secured using cryptography, and since there is no point of central failure, applications are well protected against fraudulent practices and hacking attacks. You can\u2019t gain access to one node and make any changes you want to the blockchain.Transactions Ethereum uses \u2018Smart Contracts,\u2019 which make it possible to exchange anything of value, in an an absolutely risk-free manner as it is recorded in computer code, and eliminates reliance on third parties. For example, instead of buying photographs from websites, you buy them from the photographer directly and initiate a contract for the same.Storing dataServer farms are digital storehouses with hundreds of servers used to store information. Corporations like Dropbox and Microsoft store huge quantities of data in these farms, and the problem with this is that they concentrate a large amount of their storage on a single location. These locations can be destroyed entirely, if attacked by external factors such as natural disasters or hackers. While redundant systems are created, it involves extra cost.This is where Ethereum\u2019s decentralised system saves the day. In a decentralised storing system, data is not concentrated to one single farm in one country, but is distributed to hundreds of computers all over the world. It\u2019s blockchain technology can be used to quickly encrypt and transfer data all over the world.Building DAOs Ether can also be used to build and run Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs) which are completely autonomous and decentralised, and have no single leader, and have features such as voting rights. They run on a programming code that replaces the rules of a traditional structured organisation, eliminating the need for centralised control.Types of WalletsEther or ETH, cannot be stored on Bitcoin wallets \u2014 instead, it requires its own wallet. Here are some popular wallets that can be used to store Ethereum:Hardware WalletsThese provide the best security, but come at a hefty price, between $50-$100. Some of the leading Hardware Wallets which provide maximum security areTREZORLedgerKeepKeyThese hardware support both Bitcoin and Ethereum protocols, allowing you to store both currencies in a single device.Zebpay\u2019s Ethereum Exchange Like its Bitcoin exchange service, Zebpay now also provides an Ethereum exchange, and is one of the simplest and easiest ones to buy, sell and trade ETH. Of course this means that Zebpay is storing your private key with them. Which is why Zebpay recommends you move your holdings to a private wallet of your choice.MyEtherWalletMyEtherWallet.com is an online interface that helps you create, access and operate ETH wallets right from its blockchain. It\u2019s fairly simply designed, while maintaining high security standards to prevent any theft. You can also run this site offline for extra security.Ethereum\u2019s Market HistoryLaunched in 2015, the price of Ethereum has risen rapidly. While it was priced at $10 within 18 months after its launch in 2015, it climbed to $395 in March 2017, before plummeting from $395 in June to $155 a month later. In December 2017, it peaked beyond $1300 for a short while.giphyThese rapid rises and dips are of course, not new to cryptocurrencies, are due to multiple market factors and the the interest it has garnered in online currencies. Ether has had a steady growth, despite the highly volatile nature of cryptocurrencies.Download Zebpay app to buy, sell and trade cryptocurrencies in India.

As facilitator I suggested we might record the sessions. This is the first to be published.Attendees:Arthur Falls: Host of The Ether Review, State Change, Director of Media, ConsenSysAlex Sims: Associate Professor, Head of Commercial Law, The University of Auckland \u2014 Research project on regulating crypto in NZ and Aus.Liesl Eichholz: Studying Master of Laws, University of Otago \u2014 LLM in blockchain technologies and their implications for the law in NZ, as well as regulatory options.Hannah Glass: Solicitor, King & Wood Mallesons \u2014 Ensuring blockchains work within the law, nationally and internationally.Matt Corva: Law and Business, ConsenSys \u2014 Pushing the limits of what is legally possible with blockchain technology, especially with real use cases and actual enforceable contracts.Peter Van Valkenburgh \u2014 Director of Research at CoinCenter \u2014 Interested in open/permissionless blockchains and what they can be used for, as well as securities regulation.Arthur Falls \u2014 Director of Media at ConsenSys and Host of Ether Review \u2014 Interested in creating media covering blockchains and the law, which is currently lacking.Reputation:Matt \u2014 Pervasive view that anything related to blockchain/crypto is also related to drug money/dark net. Culture that hasn\u2019t been shaken yet. There are things that we can be doing to extinguish the (thankfully already dying) narrative that crypto = shady. Can be championed by legal sector.Hannah \u2014 In Aus, it has moved on from this. Less people using BTC, more focusing on Ethereum. Still a huge amount of misinformation, with people conflating blockchain with Bitcoin, which is a problem.Peter \u2014 Dangerous to distinguish between blockchain and Bitcoin, because many great tools are being based on the Bitcoin blockchain. Doesn\u2019t think there is a big need for involvement of law in here; every new technology leads to misinformation, and widespread public adoption is what will change the view. Example of souped up vehicles being created as a result of bootleggers needing to escape the police \u2014 technological movement which ultimately led to real advances in automotive science. Same with the internet, and will be the same with blockchain networks.Matt \u2014 Legal aspect is important because lawyers are often the front line between the establishment and new technologies \u2014 the establishment needs specialists to tell them what is \u2018ok to use\u2019. Maybe 10% of F500 companies are still questioning the value of blockchains.Hannah \u2014 Role is to work with traditional clients (banks, government), who are pretty excited with the new technology, and also with start-ups. The goal is to bridge the gap between government and business. Regulators are realising that blockchain is not necessarily Bitcoin, which is why Aus now has a regulatory sandbox for companies to experiment.Peter \u2014 Open blockchains still have something in common with BTC, which regulators may be uncomfortable with: censorship resistance. There is no central intermediary who can stop actions on the network, which central authorities (i.e. governments) are scared of.Hannah \u2014 When working with large organisations, the \u201cwhat happens if things go wrong\u201d question comes up often. Immutable ledgers already exist (e.g. land titles), but fraudulent activities can be rendered void. On a blockchain, an \u2018equal and opposite\u2019 transaction can be created to \u2018reverse\u2019 transactions; the ledger is still immutable, but there can be a legal framework which allows for reversals as a legal fiction.Peter \u2014 Agreed, but in terms of censorship resistance (ex ante, rather than ex post), central institutions are still nervous about losing their powers. It is a trade off, and a sticky subject; regulators have become comfortable with the assumption that there are only a few large financial institutions to cover, but blockchains change this. The change from ex ante to ex post intervention in banned transactions will be unpalatable for regulators.Hannah \u2014 Agreed; there needs to be a way to stop something illegal happening before it happens. Something like a clearing house exists to stop transactions from going through before they need to be reversed. Trade-off between being censorship-resistant systems and others. Asking what our existing systems are for in the first place; to ensure financial stability.Peter \u2014 DTCC working on a similar system for settlements and clearing; a blockchain with 1 node.Matt \u2014 Some identity solutions and settlement solutions which don\u2019t start with a public/permissionless chain; just a federation or small group of nodes. This requires trust, but it is just changed from one party to another. No one expects, especially as consensus algorithms evolve, everything to be moved to a public blockchain instantly. Integration will need to happen slowly.Peter \u2014 Referring to Matt\u2019s concern about public perception: do we run the risk of presenting a \u2018safe\u2019 blockchain with identified nodes, but which require trust? Will policymakers then take this and ignore or even crush the open networks, because they are perceived as unsafe?Matt \u2014 Thinks that the public perception of \u2018drug money\u2019 is a dying narrative, so is not too worried about policymakers crushing open networks \u2014 but it is a risk. Businesses are trying to capitalise on the bad reputation of BTC to espouse private networks. However, contrary to this perspective, open networks can be safer: crypto-economics make it unfavourable to cheat the network, and they are publicly auditable, as well as having more developers working on them. Questions will be answered by technology, not fear.Peter \u2014 It would be like having internal wikis instead of Wikipedia because of the risk of public access and decentralisation.Hannah \u2014 Facebook probably has more information on people than the government; making people realise this, and making them feel secure about having their identity online (on a blockchain) is the way forward.Identity:Matt \u2014 People need to realise that there is a way to use our identities to our favour online without giving our information away to centralised \u2018identity controllers\u2019 such as Facebook.Hannah \u2014 Aus is looking at changing laws to focus not on ownership of personal information, but of control. Individuals will have the right to control who has their details and when.Matt \u2014 Changes the scenario for the better in terms of enterprise; it is difficult for them to hold information without some legal issues. If identity is no longer held on a central database, the people no longer need to trust institutions to know or control what is happening with their data.Arthur \u2014 Proponents of federated identity or self-sovereign identity; can the former be subsumed by the latter? Identity is at the core of law in many ways.Peter \u2014 Legal personages are an important concept in the law, in terms of agreements and jurisdiction. However, there is fairly little regulation of this.Matt \u2014 The systemic system of rules and laws is all based around identity. It associates e.g. a piece of property with a person or entity; at the core of everything in society is the relationship between persons and things (or persons and persons). Identity is foundational for how the world works, and will become more foundational with the coming advent of AI and other \u2018inanimate\u2019 intelligences, which will need identities of some sort.Peter \u2014 Transition should be to move away from government and the law. Experiments with robust state control over IP or ideas are pretty poor; copyright is not a great regime for incentivising innovation, and is incredibly hard to enforce as a property right, especially on the internet. The state doesn\u2019t have a good handle on retaining legal property rights to information in a digital age. The idea of this extending to medical records/personal info on Facebook is not appealing. Rather, finding new ways of restricting others from using one\u2019s own identity is the better answer; the law does not need to make rules around information use, as the architecture of the technology will do this instead. Decentralised networks give a right to information not enforced by government, but by cryptography.Property:Arthur \u2014 When we use systems that are currently enshrined in law, e.g. property conveyance\u2026Peter \u2014 Property records use case has never made much sense to Peter; better registries will not help if the government is corrupt.Matt \u2014 With the proper system, there will not be the ability to create ex post changes on an open network. Land registries are complex and involve many parties. It\u2019s about getting all the information in one place.Peter \u2014 Blockchain/property connection often touted, but government will not abdicate power to an open network.Liesl \u2014 But 2-of-2 multi-sig systems could make this more secure by preventing the government from changing the ledger without the owner\u2019s consent.Matt \u2014 The government will be able to come in as an actor on a public chain to make registries more efficient without reducing individual rights. Using the same traditional actors, but doing it in a less traditional way.Hannah \u2014 Really easy to use existing public records to create land registers on a blockchain; plus we could incorporate instruments such as mortgages to make the administration more secure and reduce errors. Allows trust even where the system is more open.Peter \u2014 If it\u2019s only going to happen with the closed systems, as the government does not want to give up power over land titles, this could have been done years ago on a non-blockchain system. We need to remove government entirely through the technology\u2019s design.Matt \u2014 This is a very future-focused view, but the collective action problem will be solved after a transitionary period.Digital identity:Arthur \u2014 Having a public key infrastructure that is legally recognised came up at the Standards meeting in Sydney.Hannah \u2014 Estonia already has a system in place where the government has issued digital identity cards, giving them the right to control information and see who has access to it. However, this means that the government has all this information, which people don\u2019t like. However, we are comfortable giving this information to e.g. Facebook. A lot of the identity discussion is about public perception. We all want the rights to our own information, but it is about setting up a system where the information is stored in such a way that those without permission cannot get access, by virtue of the design, rather than trust.Peter \u2014 You can enter a legally binding contract with nothing more than a digital signature; there is no need for government to legally recognise a particular standard of identification (digital or otherwise). We need laws which are agnostic on technological standards, as these will not cover all eventualities for now or in the future. Arizona has tried to update the Electronic Signatures Act to allow the inclusion of blockchains as binding contracts; Peter thinks this is misguided, as they tried to define a blockchain, which should not be in the realm of government, especially at these early stages of the technology.Matt \u2014 Proposed amendments in Delaware regarding corporate law; quite successful in being technology agnostic.Hannah \u2014 We have laws in place to make sure that signatures match the parties\u2019 agreement, and that the lack of pen-to-paper consent does not mean a contract is unenforceable. We need digital contracts to be in human-readable form, but not paper form. There are existing principles which we do not need to change, but to simply adapt.Matt \u2014 Sometimes we don\u2019t need to change rules completely. But enterprise wants certainty in outcome, not a vague indication that they can rely on the common law, for example. They want to know that their contracts are actually enforceable; they can\u2019t just rely on an assumption, which is where the concern arises. The need for mainstream consensus arises here (e.g. an agreement that certain types of contracts are enforceable).Hannah \u2014 Starting to arrive at that consensus in Aus in terms of electronic signatures.Peter \u2014 This area is not too bad in the US either.Matt \u2014 The reasons to doubt the enforceability of digital signatures go beyond whether the signature was valid; jurisdictional issues etc. It\u2019s about generally getting people to be comfortable with the technology.Peter \u2014 Would be cool to have an open network for public key infrastructure, where people can attest that they are behind a specific address, and other people/institutions can make attestations about that person, which that person can then share with whomever they want in whatever degree they want.Arthur \u2014 The catch here is the potential liability that comes with attesting to a particular identity. E.g. a bank makes an attestation, and then the person uses the attestation in a fraudulent way, potentially giving someone down the line the ability to sue the attestor. Banks will probably never play ball with federated identity because of the risks.Peter \u2014 Systems could be put in place to hedge these risks. KYC information has to do with de-risking, which comes from regulators (who are worried about crime and terrorism). This is why banks are so averse to BTC. KYC regulations are miscalibrated.Hannah \u2014 Aus is reviewing AML/CFT Financing Act, to re-calibrate the regulations. Looking to bring BTC/blockchain exchanges into a legitimate environment by examining the issues and trying to overcome them.Peter \u2014 Aus should lead way way with this, as the US is having trouble in this area. E.g. US-based non-profits who have involvement overseas are having trouble with financial regulation; 42% have resorted to physically moving bags of cash on a plane. But the de-risking is so strong in the US that it is stifling.Matt \u2014 This is all about figuring out a better way than existing systems allow. There has not been a large clash yet between private systems and government toleration, although this may happen soon. But by continuing discussion and working on the technology, we will start to solve these problems.Discussions for the future:Hannah \u2014 ICOs and token sales (cf.

But we will touch on some stuffs which had not been widely presented such as how the bug was not as obvious to the coder, how to track the wallets with events, a message left by the first exploiter and time line of 15 exploiters racing against time.ConstructorThe bug was introduced when the coder was updating the contract to gather all the common functions into a library so that each new wallet can be deployed at 70% cheaper.Code (in Solidity) before update:// constructor is given number of sigs required to do protected \"onlymanyowners\" transactions// as well as the selection of addresses capable of confirming them.function multiowned(address[] _owners, uint _required) {  m_numOwners = _owners.length + 1;  m_owners[1] = uint(msg.sender);  m_ownerIndex[uint(msg.sender)] = 1;  for (uint i = 0; i < _owners.length; ++i) {    m_owners[2 + i] = uint(_owners[i]);    m_ownerIndex[uint(_owners[i])] = 2 + i;  }  m_required = _required;}Code after update:// constructor is given number of sigs required to do protected \"onlymanyowners\" transactions// as well as the selection of addresses capable of confirming them.function initMultiowned(address[] _owners, uint _required) {  m_numOwners = _owners.length + 1;  m_owners[1] = uint(msg.sender);  m_ownerIndex[uint(msg.sender)] = 1;  for (uint i = 0; i < _owners.length; ++i) {    m_owners[2 + i] = uint(_owners[i]);    m_ownerIndex[uint(_owners[i])] = 2 + i;  }  m_required = _required;}Wait, only the function name is different!Before the update, the function name multiowned is the same as the contract name, this would mean that the function is a constructor and will only be called once, when the contract is created. After the update, the function name has been changed to initMultiowned and the contract name has been changed too but to WalletLibrary . This meant that this is no longer a constructor and anyone could call this function to change the owners anytime, granting them access to any funds stored in the wallet.Multisig wallets eventsSince anyone can write their own multisig wallet in Ethereum, there is no single standard. However, you can create wallets from the user interface of Mist and Parity thus these are the most widely used wallets. To track their usage, we can look at the following 4 events that could be emitted whenever a wallet makes a transaction.event SingleTransact(address owner, uint value, address to, bytes data, address created);event MultiTransact(address owner, bytes32 operation, uint value, address to, bytes data, address created);event SingleTransact(address owner, uint value, address to, bytes data);event MultiTransact(address owner, bytes32 operation, uint value, address to, bytes data);The events can be tracked by the hash of their signature. For example, for the first event, the signature isSingleTransact(address,uint256,address,bytes,address)The Keccak-256 hash of the signature is0x9738cd1a8777c86b011f7b01d87d484217dc6ab5154a9d41eda5d14af8caf292You can see an example of this event being emitted in a transaction at Etherscan. Etherscan also provides an api for events and you can access one here that fetches all emits of this event from block 4,000,000 to 4,060,000.If you run a non pruned node, you can run the following nodejs code to retrieve the logs for his event.let filter = web3.eth.filter({  topics: ['0x9738cd1a8777c86b011f7b01d87d484217dc6ab5154a9d41eda5d14af8caf292'],  fromBlock: 4000000,  toBlock: 4060000,});filter.get(function(error, result) {  if (error) {    console.log(error);  } else {    console.log(result);  }});Usage of multisig walletsHere are the number of times the 4 events were emitted per day since the birth of Ethereum. The y axis is in logarithmic scale. As observed, the events are emitted quite often, and it is not obvious which day the bug was fully exploited (marked with bubble). Do note that this data is not filtered and it is possible for non wallets to emit this event too.Next we weight the count of events with the amount of ether transferred in that event.Now it is obvious that during the day of exploit, there is huge spike in the weighted events.Next we filter the events and only show those that were emitted by vulnerable wallets. This can be done by inspecting the code of the contract emitting the event and matching for code snippets unique to the vulnerable contract.As observed, the vulnerable contract was first used in February 2017. The y axis is in logarithmic scale and shows that these contracts were not widely used relatively. In this case, the day of the exploit is obvious even without weighting the events.Even if the wallets were not frequently utilized, they could still be storing significant amount of value. Here we look at the amount of ether stored in all vulnerable contracts per day. They could be storing tokens too but this is not reflected here.We could also factor in ether\u2019s USD price.There were significant value stored but it took more than 100 days before it was exploited.1337This is the first transaction to transfer ether out using the exploit and the following event was emitted.event SingleTransact(address owner, uint value, address to, bytes data);The following is the RLP encoded arguments which can also be found at Etherscan.0x000000000000000000000000b3764761e297d6f121e79c32a65829cd1ddb4d320000000000000000000000000000000000000000000005ac7391989a21040000000000000000000000000000b3764761e297d6f121e79c32a65829cd1ddb4d32000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000008000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000021337000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000Decoding it, we can see the message left by the first exploiter in the 4th argument bytes data which serves no other purpose since this is a normal transfer. Only calls to other contracts require the 4th argument.owner: 0xb3764761e297d6f121e79c32a65829cd1ddb4d32value: 26,793 etherto:    0xb3764761e297d6f121e79c32a65829cd1ddb4d32data:  0x133715 exploitersOnce the exploit is out, it is a race to drain more than 500 other vulnerable wallets. Next we look at the race with 14 other exploiters.Ether and tokens are included and the USD$ value is used here to normalize the y axis. Each of the 15 exploiters is represented by a different color. Interestingly the first exploiter did not continue to drain other wallets. His next 2 exploits were 13 hours later and the next exploiter only started 6 hours after that. The first exploiter also did not choose the 3 largest wallets, which would not have been too hard to locate.Here is a zoomed-in version with logarithmic scale.Circles represent ether and triangles represent tokens. Tokens are much less valuable than indicated by their price since it is easier to redeploy a token without the lost tokens and trading liquidity is also much lower. Fortunately 2 of the exploiters had come forward and is willing to return the funds. They are indicated by green and purple above.Contact us at contact@codetract.ioVisit us at https://codetract.ioFollow us on Twitter and Medium for more updates!", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Smart Contracts", "Bugs", "Ether", "Hacking"]}, {"title": "Take Your Chances at The Ether Auction Game", "post_link": "https://medium.com/hackernoon/take-your-chances-at-the-ether-auction-game-30f9df1ec80b?source=search_post", "author_name": "Pablo Ruiz", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@pabloruiz55", "publish_date": "2017-11-14", "last_modified_date": "2019-05-13", "readtime": "6.83", "claps": 69, "voters": 11, "content": "Take Your Chances at The Ether Auction GamePablo RuizFollowNov 14, 2017 \u00b7 7 min readPhoto by NeONBRAND on UnsplashDisclaimer: This smart contract is based on the Dollar Auction game designed by economist Martin Shubik.Disclaimer 2: This article, companion code and deployed smart contract have been written with academic purposes only. The game has been deployed to Ethereum Main network meaning that, if you try it, you will be bidding with REAL money. Participate at your own risk. I\u2019m not responsible for money lost by playing the game whether it is caused by being outbid or due to a bug.* You might be wondering why, if this is only for academic purposes, I deployed the contract to work with real money. I believe it is the only way for the experiment to work as people that do participate will have some skin in the game.Disclaimer 3: Full disclosure. Since there\u2019s no way to prevent the auctioneer from using some other address or asking a friend to outbid someone, it\u2019s practically impossible for him/her to lose. If someone bid 0.05 eth and he was about to win, the auctioneer could use one of his accounts to outbid them each time until the auction at least went over 1 eth so he breaks even. As they say, the house always wins.The Ether AuctionThe ether auction is strictly based on the Dollar Auction game. According to Wikipedia:The dollar auction is a non-zero sum sequential game designed by economist Martin Shubik to illustrate a paradox brought about by traditional rational choice theory in which players with perfect information in the game are compelled to make an ultimately irrational decision based completely on a sequence of apparently rational choices made throughout the game.In the ether auction, the auctioneer volunteers 1 ether which participants can bid for. The bid starts at 0.05 eth and goes up by 0.05 eth as well. The person who bids the higher amount, by the end of the auction gets the 1 eth.There\u2019s a caveat though, the second highest bidder loses his money.So, when the auction starts people don\u2019t have to give it much thought. They are looking at some easy profit. By bidding 0.05 eth they can win 1eth.As the auction progresses it will turn into a battle between 2 people which will try to outbid the other in order to win the auction, even though they end up winning a few wei or even breaking even. (winning the auction by bidding 1 eth to get 1 eth).At this point, things get interesting. The person who is now losing the battle will now try to minimize his loses. After all, they are looking at a 0.95 eth loss. If they now bid 1.05 eth they will only lose 0.05 eth. This can go on and on until one of the two parties decides to cut his losses and stop bidding.This article by Douglas Noll explains very well the psychological reasons as to why someone will keep pushing while knowing that even if they win or lose the auction, they will lose money anyways.There is actually a globally optimal solution, which is to not play the game at all unless one is certain that there are no other players. \u2014 WikipediaBuilding the Ether Auction in EthereumI first learned about this game in this Reddit post, where the OP warned about how people could get scammed. He writes:[\u2026]However, there is a high probability that this scam is going to catch on once smart contract goes mainstream, considered how many people bought bitconnect coins when crypto currencies went somewhat mainstream.We need to educate the public and try to prevent this type of scams in order to ensure a quick and trouble free deployment of the smart contract technology, if for no other reason than to protect the value of the ethereum we own.Is it really a scam? I\u2019m not sure, probably. While it is true that the only way to actually win this game is that you are the only person playing (so a bidding war is not started), people DO know (or should know) the rules. The rules are crystal-clear, you know that if you are outbid you will lose your money.While we are on the crystal-clear rules subject, you can find the code for the contract below with comments and some explaining of each function.If you don\u2019t care about code and want to participate in the game, feel free to skip this section. I wouldn\u2019t recommend participating in this game or other similar games \u2014 or ICOs for that matter \u2014 where your eth is involved if you don\u2019t understand or care about the code, though.The code is also available on my Github repo and it has been verified on Etherscan.Contract initializationThe only thing we are doing in the constructor is making the person who deploys the contract the auctioneer. At this point he doesn\u2019t have to send the money that will be auctioned, we will do that later.In the case of the smart contract I linked above, I am the auctioneer.Starting the auctionThe auctioneer now has to start the auction by calling the function below:StartAuction is a payable function that only the auctioneer can call, once, in order to get the auction running. He has to send the 1 eth to the contract which will be auctioned. Finally, we set the auction to end 7 days after it has been deployed. Now that the auction has started, other people can send their bids to it.Participating in the auctionThe bid() function receives the eth sent and makes sure that the bid is correct (that the person bidding is sending 0.05 eth more than the highest bid). Then, it updates the bidders. The previous highest bidder is now the second highest bidder, and the person who called this function becomes the highest bidder.Finally, if the auction is about to end, it extends it in order to prevent the so called auction sniping.Finalizing the auctionOnce the 7 days pass, the auction can be finalized by calling finalizeAuction().By calling this function, ether will be distributed accordingly for participants to withdraw.The highest bidder will receive the 1 eth and his bid will be transferred to the auctioneer.The second highest bidder will lose the money he bid and it will be transferred to the auctioneer.The rest of the participants will be able to withdraw the money they bid.* If for some reason no bids were received, the auctioneer will be able to withdraw the eth he volunteered.Playing the Ethereum Auction gameOk, enough theory!I have deployed the Ethereum Auction game at address: 0x2e63cceffa42b095f0bd6d0fcadb521200b8fef5.I already started the auction by volunteering the necessary 1 eth. The auction will run for 7 days and will end on Tuesday, November 21, 2017 10:52:19 AM GMT.If someone bids within 1 hour before the auction ends, the auction will be extended by an additional hour until no one bids anymore.*If no one ends up bidding, which as discussed in the article would be the wisest, once the auction ends I will be able to get my 1 eth back.The easiest way to interact with the contract is using MyEtherWallet with the Metamask Chrome extension. You will need to enter the contract\u2019s address (which I shared above) as well as the contract\u2019s ABI which you can find here.In order to submit a bidding you have to execute the bid() function on the contract and send the correct amount of eth alongside. You can check the current highest bid by calling the highestBid() function. You must submit a bid that is 0.05 eth higher than the current highest bid.Have in mind that your bids accumulate and you won\u2019t be able to withdraw the money until after the auction finishes. Since the bids you make accumulate you will only have to bid the eth necessary to outbid the current highest bidder. For example, if you bid for the first time 0.15 eth and then you want to outbid the highest bid at 0.45 eth, instead of submitting 0.50 eth you will only have to send 0.35 eth as you had already sent 0.15 eth before.In order to know how much you have sent so far you can call myLatestBid() function.Once the auction has finished, you can withdraw your funds by calling the withdrawBalance() function. Calling this function will return all the outstanding eth you have from the contract, whether it is the eth you won or your previous bids. If yours was the second highest bid, remember you will lose your money.You can find out when the auction ends by calling auctionEndTime() which will give you the date in Unix Epoch time. You can convert the number here to get the exact date. You can also call timeRemaining() to know how many seconds remain.So, tu sum up. In order to participate you have to:1- Call highestBid() to know what\u2019s the highest bid so far.2- Call myLatestBid() to know what was your latest bid.3- Call Bid() while supplying the corresponding eth. (The highest bid plus 0.05 eth, minus whatever you had already sent in your previous bid).4- Wait for the auction to finish and call withdrawBalance() to get the corresponding eth you are entitled to. Unless yours was the second highest bid, in which case\u2026 bummer.Where to go next?I have an issue with the transparency of this contract. Given that it\u2019s in the auctioneer\u2019s best interest to have people bid so he doesn\u2019t lose money, he certainly could keep outbidding people until the threshold where he breaks even is reached. Even though we are preventing the auctioneer from directly bidding in his auction, nothing stops him from doing it from another account or asking someone else to bid from him.This leads to a huge transparency issue. Someone playing this game can\u2019t trust the auctioneer to be honest. One way to mitigate the risk of \u201cthe house\u201d cheating would be to take a cut from each bid and use that for the prize instead of having the auctioneer provide it.", "responses": 3, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Smart Contracts", "Blockchain", "Blockchain Technology", "Ether Auction Game"]}, {"title": "How to Secure Your Ether Wallet Against Theft in 10 Minutes", "post_link": "https://blog.sfox.com/how-to-secure-your-ether-wallet-against-theft-in-10-minutes-21c786cbf193?source=search_post", "author_name": "SFOX", "author_link": "https://blog.sfox.com/@SFOX", "publish_date": "2018-09-13", "last_modified_date": "2018-11-15", "readtime": "8.49", "claps": 208, "voters": 12, "content": "How to Secure Your Ether Wallet Against Theft in 10 MinutesSFOXFollowSep 13, 2018 \u00b7 9 min readThe many possibilities of crypto aren\u2019t worth much if your funds aren\u2019t secure \u2014 and nowhere is that truer than in the case of Ethereum.On November 7th of last year, just as many were learning about Ethereum and creating ether wallets for the first time, a user discovered a bug in the widely popular Parity wallet that indefinitely froze the funds in all of their multi-sig wallets. An error in Parity\u2019s smart contracts left its multi-sig users \u2014 those who were trying to get the most security available \u2014 with no way to access their own funds.More recently, on April 24, 2018, $150,000 USD of ETH vanished from the ether wallets of users on MyEtherWallet.com. In an elaborate phishing scam that involved hijacking services from Amazon, Google, and major ISPs, hackers quietly redirected traffic from the wallet provider\u2019s URL in order to capture people\u2019s account information when they entered it on the site \u2014 at which point their ETH was automatically transferred to the hackers\u2019 wallet.Ethereum is poised to revolutionize everything from fine-art ownership to early-stage startup funding, but its security norms haven\u2019t quite caught up yet: even though the protocol itself is fairly secure, it\u2019s very easy to get scammed out of your ETH if you don\u2019t know how to properly secure your ether wallet.Quick and dirty way to induce insomnia in ETH holders: just get them to google \u201cETH theft.\u201dIf you own ETH, take 10 minutes today to make sure you\u2019re following these best practices for storing and spending them. It might not seem like a priority now \u2014 but it\u2019ll probably never feel like a priority until after you\u2019ve lost all your ETH.Choose your ether wallet carefullyYour choice of ether wallet isn\u2019t like the difference between a leather and mesh wallet for your cash: different kinds of wallets are ideal for different ways of using ether, and a disreputable wallet is the crypto equivalent of a cash wallet with a giant hole in it.For ether you\u2019re holding but not actively using, use a security-audited hardware wallet like Ledger Nano S or Trezor. It takes longer to send ether to and from these wallets, but it\u2019s hard to get more secure than them. Case in point: hardware wallet users were unaffected by the MyEtherWallet.com scam because hackers couldn\u2019t remotely sign transactions on users\u2019 hardware wallets.For ether you\u2019re actively using for ICOs, token-trading, or DApps, use a reputable software wallet that allows you to make transactions quickly and safely. The current \u201cgold standard\u201d here is MetaMask, a Chrome extension that lets you create encrypted, client-side wallets for ether and ERC-20 tokens. MetaMask also allows you to use Chrome to transact with ether on websites that make use of the Ethereum blockchain, which is an added bonus if you want to start using the DApp ecosystem within a familiar browser.Keep in mind that you\u2019ll usually face a tradeoff between transaction speed and fund security. That\u2019s why you should only place as much ETH in a software wallet as you\u2019re willing to lose \u2014 put the rest in a reputable hardware wallet for safe-keeping.Constantly check that your ether wallet is \u201cthe real thing\u201dRemember the ether theft from MyEtherWallet.com this April? Even though the hackers were able to redirect users to their fraudulent servers while still using the genuine MyEtherWallet.com URL, users were likely to see this notification during the phishing debacle:Source: https://www.reddit.com/r/MyEtherWallet/comments/8ek0jj/think_i_got_scammedphishedhacked/Notice the indicator in Chrome, to the left of the URL, that the user\u2019s connection to the site is not secure. Despite this warning, many users simply checked that they\u2019d typed in the URL correctly, entered their ether wallet info, and watched their ETH disappear.Virtually every method of cryptocurrency storage is being constantly bombarded by various attempts to steal your crypto. That doesn\u2019t mean you should avoid crypto altogether: it means that you need to practice vigilance when it comes to storing and spending your crypto.Set up Google alerts for the names of every ether wallet you use. If you\u2019re using reputable, major wallets, and a security issue arises with one of them, it\u2019ll probably make the news \u2014 and Google alerts will email you that news immediately so that you know whether or not you can safely use your wallet.Subscribe to the subreddits of your ether wallets. Most major wallets have subreddits dedicated to discussing them and mentioning any issues that arise, complete with community managers who will usually respond directly to user submissions. Subscribing to these is one of the best ways to make sure you know your wallets are secure on any given day.Listen to your browser and pay attention to red flags. If your browser gives you a warning about a site\u2019s security certificate, like the one above, do not log in or provide any information. Instead, reach out to the ether wallet\u2019s support team \u2014 for example, through a submission to their subreddit \u2014 with details about your issue. These days, most ether theft is the result of users taking unnecessary risks by ignoring red flags.Look out for scams that trick you by ripping off reputable brand names. A little while ago, Google accidentally unlisted the real MetaMask extension from the Google Chrome app store. That led to a number of scammers listing extensions in the Google Chrome store named \u201cMetaMask\u201d \u2014 but if you downloaded one of these and started trying to transact with it, you would have quickly found your funds spirited away to scammers\u2019 accounts. Before you start using an ether wallet, do your research: look at reviews and consult recent news about the wallet to make sure you don\u2019t fall victim to a copycat scam.In these early days of ether and crypto, due diligence is half the battle: make sure your ether wallets are up to the best security standards out there, and routinely check to make sure that they haven\u2019t been compromised.Add ETH to your ether wallet directly \u2014 not through smart contractsThere are basically two ways to get ether:Directly, through a service like SFOX.Indirectly, through smart contracts that promise ether in return for other assets like ERC-20 tokens.Be sure to use direct methods when you\u2019re acquiring your ETH. Smart contracts are markedly less secure than the Ethereum blockchain itself, and there have been cases in which smart contracts have been used to fake transactions that never actually occurred on the Ethereum blockchain.This past March, for instance, VI Company discovered and reported a smart contract bug that allowed some wallet users to credit themselves with an arbitrary amount of ETH by making it look like a faulty wallet had transferred ETH to them. A similar kind of bug could conceivably allow someone to make it look like they paid you via a smart contract, without actually giving you ay ETH at all\u2014so it\u2019s safer to avoid the risk and buy directly,Lock down your ether wallet with strong passwordsA reputable ether wallet isn\u2019t worth much if you don\u2019t safeguard it with a strong password. These are the standards you should be using to make sure your ether is safe:Use a different password for every account. If someone learns one of your passwords, they get access to everything you use that password for.Make sure your password includes numbers, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and symbols.Your passwords should be at least 40 characters long. That doesn\u2019t mean they need to be impossible to remember: just think in terms of memorable passphrases rather than passwords. For example, instead of turning the words \u201cbabbling brook\u201d into \u201cB4bbl1ngBr00k!\u201d, try adding numbers and symbols to \u201cIt\u2019s fun to wash both of your hands and feet in a babbling brook\u201d: \u201c1tsFun2W4shB0th0fY0urH4nds&F33t1nAB4bbl1ngBr00k!\u201dIf you\u2019re worried about these password requirements being too hard to abide by, try a proven, security-audited password storage solution like Dashlane, 1password, or LastPass. This will allow you to maintain strong and varied passwords without needing to keep them all in your working memory. To state the obvious: make sure your master password for your password storage tool is especially strong!Add a second layer of security to your ether wallet with 2-factor authentication\u2014but not with a text or phone callEven a strong password is susceptible to attack, which is why it\u2019s crucial to enable 2-factor authentication (2FA) on all your ether wallets.Do not enable 2FA via text message or phone call. Scammers have recently started calling phone companies and pretending to be other people \u2014 \u201cverifying\u201d their identity using information that is often publicly available online \u2014 in order to fake 2FA and break into crypto accounts. Instead, consider one of these two much more secure methods of 2FA:Get a universal second factor (U2F). These are encrypted USB drives that you insert into your computer as a form of 2FA. The industry-standard U2F right now is Yubikey, which is available from $20 USD and up. Google has also just released its own U2F, Titan, which is available for $50 USD.Get a reputable authenticator app on your phone. Google Authenticator, for example, generates a 2FA code that changes every 30 seconds \u2014 and, unlike a text message code or phone call, cellular providers can\u2019t provide a scammer with a code from an authenticator app installed on your phone.With two layers of security on your accounts and your own due diligence about the ether wallet provider, your ether should be safe from many major scams.Pay for an established VPN on all your devicesDoing all of the above would make you fairly safe from threats to your ether wallet \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t hurt to take steps to reduce the number of threats you have to deal with in the first place.The best way to do this is by paying for a widely known and well-reviewed virtual private network (VPN). This will encrypt your internet connection, even if you\u2019re on public WiFi, adding another layer of protection between your ether and the many hackers who stalk public WiFi connections. Consider one of the following VPN providers:NordVPN, headquartered in Central AmericaExpressVPN, headquartered in the British Virgin IslandsVyprVPN, headquartered in SwitzerlandThere are free VPNs available, but the consensus is that these are vastly inferior to paid options.

It simulates a world of ether monsters (Etheremon) where you can capture, trade and transform Etheremons to defeat others.Battle is one of the most important and exciting aspects of the Etheremon World. There are a few battle modes under development. In this blog, we will introduce you to the castle battle mode.1. Etheremon attributesBefore describing the castle battle mode, let\u2019s talk about Etheremon attributes.1.1 Battle Power (BP)Each Etheremon you capture has a battle power (Follow this guide to capture a new Etheremon). Battle Power is a single, simplified value that encapsulates all six of an Etheremon\u2019s battle stats: Health Point (HP), Primary Attack (PA), Secondary Attack (SA), Primary Defense (PD), Secondary Defense (SD), and Speed (SP).Experience (EXP) can only be gained through battle; the higher EXP the higher level the Etheremon is. Etheremon at higher level have higher stats and are basically stronger. Also, after reaching a certain level, some Etheremons will gain the ability to Transform.1.2. TypesEach Etheremon has 1 to 3 types. There are 17 types: insect, dragon, mystic, fire, phantom, earth, neutral, telepath, iron, lightning, combat, flyer, leaf, toxin, rock, water, ice. Each type has an advantage over another type. The diagram below reflects the relationships between types:1.3. AncestorsEach Etheremon has 1 to 3 ancestors (except 23 \u201clegendary\u201d Etheremons). An ancestor increases their descendant\u2019s offensive stats in the battle. For example, Cobrus has Mizumi, Chulember and Vivorin as its ancestors, so if Cobrus joins the battle with those Etheremons, its attack power is increased1.4. GasonThere is a special class called Gason. When a Gason is in your party, it increases defensive stats for all Ethremons of the same type.2. Castle Mode2.1. CastlesIn the Etheremon World, there are special locations called \u201chills\u201d where you can build and defend your own castle. A total of 30 \u201chills\u201d have been discovered in the World. Ever since their discovery, MonSeekers have been battling non-stop to claim the hills and train their Etheremons.Building and defending a castleOn an empty hill, you can build a castle by hiring a Blockid builder squad at the cost of at least 0.04 ether or 15 EMON for 5 bricks.For each battle lost, the castle is damaged and loses 1 brick. For each battle win, the castle owner is rewarded 1 EMON. However, the number of rewarded token can not be higher than the number of bricks.For every 8 battles won, the castle receives an extra honor brick from the squad of Blockid. However, the total of honor bricks can not be higher than the number of bricks.Once the number of bricks drops to 0, the castle falls.You can strengthen your castle at the beginning by building it with more bricks (1 extra brick = 0.008 eth or 3 EMON).To defend your castle, you form a team of 3 Etheremons called battlers with up to 3 other Etheremons called supporters. Supporters should be gasons or ancestors of battlers used to increase battlers\u2019 offensive stats and defensive stats.Attacking a castleYou can attempt to take down a castle by launching attacks to reduce its strength. Your attacking team will also consist of 3 battlers and up to 3 supporters. Each time you attack a castle, if successful, will be rewarded 1 EMON.2.2. Battle mechanismThe main gameIn an Etheremon battle, each team will consist of 3 battlers and up to 3 supporters. Battlers will fight each other respectively depending on their positions, meaning first vs first, second vs second, and third vs third. In each matchup, a series of one-on-one fights between members of the opposing teams are automatically simulated in our smart contract according to the following rules:The Etheremons take turns attacking. The one with higher speed attacks first.Primary Defense reduces the damage of incoming Primary Attack, Secondary Defense reduces the damage of incoming Secondary Attack.During a turn, whichever attack (either Primary or Secondary Attack) that results in most total damage to the defender will be performed by the attacker, damaging the defenders\u2019 HP.In each turn, the attacker might be able to land a \u201ccritical attack\u201d, which means its Primary Attack/ Secondary Attack will be much higher than normal. This totally depends on random chance.The first Etheremon to lose all of its HP loses the fight.The winning Etheremon is rewarded with a large amount of experience and the losing Etheremon also gains experience but of a lesser amount.The remaining battlers will continue the matchups.There are a total of 3 matchups, and the team which triumph in 2 or more matchups wins the overall battle.SupportersEach team consists of up to 3 supporters. They can be battlers\u2019 ancestors or gasons.A supporting ancestor increases all of its descendant\u2019s offensive stats by 10% (e.g: Primary Attack & Secondary Attack increased 10%). This effect repeats if there are multiple ancestors e.g. if there are 2 ancestors of the battling Etheremons present, Primary Attack & Secondary Attack increased by 20%A supporting gason supports all battlers of its types. These battlers will receive 10% increase in defensive stats (e.g: Primary Defense & Secondary Defense increased by 10%).For example: Pudde is in the battle team and supporters are Mushmite, Vermillios, Mirrie. Pudde\u2019s offensive stats are increased by 20% and defensive stats are increased by 10%.Notes: multiple ancestors of the same kind or multiple gason of the same types are counted as one. For example, if you put three Polynimos as supporters, any battlers with the fire type receive a 10% increase in defensive stats (instead of 30%).TypesWhen an Etheremon is battling another Etheremon that it has type advantage over, its offensive stats are increased by 20%.Exp GainExperience gain is calculated in each matchup, depending mostly on the level of the opposing Etheremon. The higher the level of the opponent, the more experience your Mon can gain. For example, a level-1 Mon needs around 3.22 wins against other level-1s to level up. A level-10 Mon needs 5.8 wins against other level-10s, but 15.6 wins against level-5s or 42.4 wins against level-1s.A loss also gives exp equal to 1/3 the amount of experience from a win.For more information, you can read our smart contract here\u2014 \u2014 \u2014Follow us atFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/etheremon/Tweeter: https://twitter.com/myetheremonReddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/etheremon/Email: contact@etheremon.com", "responses": 2, "tags": ["Gaming", "Crypto", "Ethereum", "Etheremon", "English"]}, {"title": "Etheremon \u2014 Building the Foundation of Game 3.0 with Blockchain", "post_link": "https://medium.com/etheremon/etheremon-building-the-foundation-of-game-3-0-with-blockchain-899ed5673e21?source=search_post", "author_name": "Etheremon", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@myetheremon", "publish_date": "2018-05-02", "last_modified_date": "2018-08-16", "readtime": "3.99", "claps": 301, "voters": 12, "content": "Etheremon \u2014 Building the Foundation of Game 3.0 with BlockchainEtheremonFollowMay 2, 2018 \u00b7 4 min readETHEREMON is one of the first blockchain games built on the Ethereum network. It creates a world of Ether Monsters (Mons) in which players can:Capture and train Mons to form a powerful teamBattle against others\u2019 teamsTrade Mons and collect in-game currency for monetary reward.ETHEREMON was created from the founders\u2019 passion to bring joy and meaningful interaction into the hottest, newest technology platform \u2014 blockchain. But above all, setting the foundation of Gaming 3.0 is the mission.To put this into perspective, let\u2019s first examine the Gaming 1.0 and 2.0 experience.Game 1.0 and 2.0, a quick glance at historyThe ultimate control of game developers is the biggest issueGame 1.0 \u2014 A few successful titles in the first wave of video games were Super Mario, Contra, Tetris, Pokemon, GTA. These are mostly single-player games, which focus on letting one (or occasionally few other players) immerse in the narrative of a fantasy world. These titles can be hosted on different medium like console, PC, mobile, but the simple interaction classifies them in the Game 1.0 era.Source: Mario \u2014 example of Game 1.0Game 2.0 and 2.5 \u2014 With the rise of the internet, people can be connected through a shared narrative in a multiplayer environment. The most successful ones in Game 2.0 are the Massively multiplayer online games (MMO) like League of Legends, Dota 2, CS:GO or Diablo III.Source: Overwatch \u2014 example of Game 2.5The success of MMO established Esports: competitive gaming at professional level. Watching the experts competing in Esports tournaments has become a popular form of entertainment. An industry estimated to worth $1.5Billion in 2020, Esports defines Game 2.5.Nevertheless, players continue to call for a more fulfilling gaming experience. From single to shared narrative, now players are looking to fully immerse in their game environment. Likewise, true ownership over the experience is demanded. Players no longer tolerate when characters which they spent years to build got replicated or nerfed within seconds by games\u2019 developer. These titles become less enticing to players as their efforts could be worthless. The idea that every video game is centralized, exclusively controlled by a handful of developers and distributors is challenged. These are answered as we transcend into Game 3.0.Game 3.0 \u2014 Combination of Blockchain and Virtual RealityVirtual Reality (VR) \u2014 changing interactivity in gamingETHEREMON \u2014 Future VR world of Etheremons on blockchainVR technology is on the race of getting better and cheaper everyday. This means full immersion is becoming more accessible to the general public, especially gamers. Advanced motion tracking provided in most recent VR headset is making it intuitive and fascinating for players to interact with the virtual game environment. Though VR Games are still in its infancy phase, it is definitely leading the revolution of Game 3.0.Players change the way they interact in VR environment, yet the game infrastructure stays almost the same. This still leaves players dependent on the game creator and distributor, with little to no ownership over their experience and character. That\u2019s where blockchain can make a difference in Game 3.0.Blockchain \u2014 the revolutionary approach to gamingBuilt on the decentralized network, games like ETHEREMON can bring the advantages of blockchain into gaming.Etheremon \u2014 Real battle game on blockchain#1. Player\u2019s full ownershipBlockchain game can eliminate the middleman \u2014 the game distributor. The role of the game creator is similarly minimized. In ETHERMON, this mean the players are the true owners of the game. Players have complete control over their gaming assets: their Mons and their in-game currency. As these data stored on blockchain is unchangeable, player\u2019s assets can\u2019t be altered by anyone; even if the distributor and the creator is no longer in operation.#2. Trustless marketplaceTransactions on blockchain are transparent. This allow ETHEREMON to create a safe and efficient environment for players to extract real value through trading their game assets.The latest data from March to April 2018 showed that on average, players are making 400% return selling their Mons on ETHERMON market. In the same period, the highest priced Mon was sold at 4.99 ETH (USD$2500 at the time of transaction), a whopping 4990% profit from the initial investment of 0.1 ETH.#3. 100% uptimeLastly, ETHEREMON is host on the Ethereum network, where every node maintain the chain. This ensures zero downtime , reduces risk of tampering and fraud.\u2026having said that, blockchain has its limitations which are being addressedThe intrinsic challenge of blockchain is high transaction fee at high volume of transaction. At the moment, it is costly for players to play during \u2018peak\u2019 periods. To overcome this, ETHEREMON team incorporated an off-chain, centralized solution inside the decentralized environment. This method allows some activities that do not benefit from the advantages of blockchain to be hosted off-chain. While taking the advantages of decentralized network, ETHEREMON utilizes resources efficiently to reduce transaction fees for players.Combining Blockchain and VR, the revolution of Game 3.0 is on the way. These technology will enable players to have full ownership and immersion in the fantasy world. One of the first blockchain games, ETHEREMON is on its way to set the foundation of Game 3.0.\u2014 \u2014 \u2014Follow us at:Website: https://www.etheremon.com/Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/etheremonTwitter: https://twitter.com/myetheremonDiscord: https://discord.gg/xgJpuzcTelegram: https://t.me/myetheremonReddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/etheremonEmail: contact@etheremon.com", "responses": 2, "tags": ["Releases", "Ethereum", "Blockchain", "Gaming", "Featured"]}, {"title": "The Crowdsale Analyst: ether.camp \u2014 the altruistic hackathon platform?", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@danielzakrisson/the-crowdsale-analyst-ether-camp-the-altruistic-hackathon-platform-f4053c540f8e?source=search_post", "author_name": "Daniel Zakrisson", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@danielzakrisson", "publish_date": "2016-10-18", "last_modified_date": "2018-02-26", "readtime": "8.53", "claps": 11, "voters": 11, "content": "The Crowdsale Analyst: ether.camp \u2014 the altruistic hackathon platform?Daniel ZakrissonFollowOct 18, 2016 \u00b7 9 min readether.camp is launching their crowdsale in just two days (hack.ether.camp/sale). This is one of the most loudly debated projects in recent weeks, mainly because of their 50 million USD cap on the crowdsale. 50 million? Yes, they have actually put a cap at 50 million on this thing. I don\u2019t know Roman Mandeleil and have never used any of the products ether.camp have developed, so I\u2019m looking at this crowdsale purely based on the information given on the website, the white paper, the ether.camp blog and recent ether.camp Reddit discussions.I\u2019m very subjectively scoring each section on a scale of 1 to 5, where 3 should be neutral in the eyes of a potential investor.Project: ether.camp crowdfundAs described in the white paper:ether.camp is a project aimed to create the ideal innovation environment for startups by utilising blockchain technology for the release of the Virtual Accelerator.ether.camp is a recurring hackathon event, with the second hackathon coming up shortly. According to a blog post they have 1700 hackers and fans (what does that mean?) signed up for the event. Before the event developers have been able to pitch ideas and form teams, and the goal during the five week event is to create products out of these ideas.Team/Founders 1/5Do these guys have what it takes to succeed as entrepreneurs? Track record and previous projects? Experience and formal education? 1/5This is tricky \u2014 because the only publicly known member of ether.camp is Roman Mandeleil. After a software dev career he join the Ethereum project and was the EthereumJ (Java client) lead developer in 2014, after which he left to start ether.camp. At ether.camp he has led several Ethereum based projects, such as Ethereum Studio, Ethereum Harmony, Ethereum Java Peer and live.ether.camp. To my knowledge none of these are commercial projects, so we have no real information about the teams ability to run a commercial platform. Roman has delivered on several projects and seems very well respected in the community (as seen by the judges they have attracted to the ether.camp hackathon). But, there is no mention and no information about the team in the white paper which is a huge miss. As I\u2019ve said before \u2014 the team and their ability to execute on product, business and company formation is the absolutely most important part of any project.  During the recent (Reddit AMA) several red flags was raised from my perspective:Roman said there is a dedicated team solely working on hack.ether.camp \u2014 but on the hack.ether.camp website only two people are listed to work on hack.ether.camp (Mikhail Kalinin and Anton Maximov)ether.camp governance, or lack thereof as stated by Roman in the AMA:<ether.camp> is private company so we keep the inernal strucure private for now. I can be seen as a responsible for any project we do.Since the team is the most important success factor this lack of transparency is a huge issue for me.  I\u2019m sure Roman is a very competent person, but the answers given does not provide any assurance. This part of their proposal is downright bad.Market Potential 1/5In the (Reddit AMA) the answer to monetization of the platform is very vague:(Q) Thanks for your answers. As a follow up: Do you automatically expect the great user experience and startup ideas to turn into revenue and salaries for your team to go forward? Revenue is crucial for the sustainability of any business in the world \u2014 be it blockchain or normal.  (A) I do agree that revenue is crucial for any buisness, but a startup can focus on the platform for some time and leave the monetization part for later. Google and Facebook are just 2 examples of such a story.So no market vision in sight, which is another problem even if there surely are ways to monetise a successful platform. But, since this is not on the map currently we can at least be sure this is some (a long) time into the future.Product/Business/Operating Plan 2/5Proof of concept available? How many iterations are done? MVP available? Is the product validated by outside users? 2/5The first hackathon is already done, but I cannot find any information on the website that describes the outcome of this event. Did any of the projects or teams live on after the event?  For the Virtual Accelerator platform itself it seems like some code is available (github). But, the web site and white paper are still (2 days before the sale goes live) not complete and has only empty space where they are supposed to put code examples. But, since 50 % of all funds raised will go to platform development (from 0.5 to 25 million USD) this platform clearly has a lot of work left to do.What is the current operating plan and why do they need funding now? 1/5They need funding in order to continue run the ether.camp hackathons, continue to expand their scope and finish development of the platform. But, very weak arguments are given for why they need money now and how much they really need. In the minimum funding scenario (still a wide span of 1\u20135 million USD) they say they will focus on platform development and move quickly to platform monetisation, which in my opinion sounds like a sound idea as it will show the viability of the platform as a commercial project sooner rather than later.  Further, I have serious doubts about the ability the use funds efficiently given the very wide span they go for. Let\u2019s say they reach the max of 50 million USD, in this case 25 million USD goes to platform development. The website says they will spend this over three years before financing the platform with monetisation. 25 million USD equals a staff over 104 people (given a cost of $80 000 per employee per year) over the full three years on platform development alone \u2014 and this is for a platform without any public road map, vision or goals. Another lacking point is that they have no plan or description of the team they are aiming to build. How many people are they going to recruit? In which positions? Who will the people leading this venture be?What is the go-to market strategy? 0/5None in the white paper, which needs addressing.Roadmap 2/5A roadmap for the 2nd hackathon is given, but none for the platform development or other activities for which they raise money.Competition 3/5Do they have a clear view of the competition? How do they plan to beat them? 3/5They don\u2019t address the competition directly, but given the level of interest in the hack.ether.camp I would say this is the most well known hackathon in the Ethereum space. However, the ambition is clearly to reach outside of the Ethereum space and no clear strategy or who will be responsible for this is given.Valuation 1/5Is valuation sane? 1/5For some reason I cannot understand they have chosen to set a maximum cap in the fundraise of 50 million USD. Five Zero Zero Zero Zero Zero Zero Zero dollars. They describe their project as doable with as little as 1 million USD, but have set the mega cap in order to avoid a crowdsale that ends in minutes, hours or days. Also, it\u2019s very important to note that the HKG token does not entitle to anything on the ether.camp platform (ether.camp blog):As it\u2019s important for us to comply with US security regulations backers don\u2019t have rights on any other part of the project \u2014 no IP, no revenue stream and no shared ownership.The only right given to holders of the HKG token is the possibility to participate in the first phase of crowdfunding for projects in ether.camp hackathons and vote on the use of funds in these projects.As a token holder you can be an early adopter in hackathon projects, by exchanging HKG tokens for specific tokens released by the project (if I understand it correctly). This way the project gets HKG tokens that can be sold (for seed funding) and the token holder is now a first round investor in the project. This process is a 1:1 exchange between HKG tokens and project tokens. After the hackathon event the project can release 5 times as many tokens as released in the first round and these tokens will be available to the public for ether. Nothing is said about the pricing mechanism for this, or how the project will be able to mint and sell additional tokens at a later stage for further funding. Or does it stop there? This whole process seems a bit unpolished and not complete. Also, nothing says the project tokens will have any value at all.This means that the value of HKG tokens will come solely from what people are willing to pay for them in exchanges for the ability to participate as early adopters/backers in future hackathon events. This value will be balanced by the selling pressure from all hackathon projects selling HKG tokens in exchange for ether/bitcoin in order to fund their projects.Crowdsale and token structure 1/5The crowdsale mechanism itself also have several of the usual issues we have seen in the before:All money is available upfrontNo way of raising more funds through the HKG token, either if the project have difficulties or if it becomes a huge successInvestor vesting is not even considered since there is no issuance of tokens to the ether.camp team \u2014 meaning there is a very low level of alignment of interest with the crowdsale backers and the ether.campIf the max cap is only set because they want to give anyone interested the possibility to join, this could have been solved in so many other ways (e.g. pro-rata issuance, Dutch auction or something else) and instead they could have put a sane cap of 2\u20133 million USD which would still be a lot of money for a project like this.Legality 5/5As an investor? 4/5As noted above they have taken care to avoid being considered an SEC security. However, this is not mentioned in the white paper or on the sale website, only in a blog post.Legality of the business 5/5 Nothing strange hereSecurity 3/5Proof of external security evaluation? 2/5To my knowledge one external security audit has been made, which was made public today (2 days before the sale starts) by Manuel Araoz (Zeppelin Medium). To me it looks a bit like the security audit published by Slockit on theDAO. They go through one of the contracts and give some general and some specific comments on the code. So far so good. What I don\u2019t like is that they start the audit by saying:We\u2019ve been asked by our friends at ether.camp to review the code for their soon-to-launch Hacker Gold (HKG) token, and to publish the results of our work.I would like security audits to be performed by hired, professional unrelated external auditors, not friends of the team. Further than that, what is interesting is not to only audit one specific contract, but how all contracts interrelate should also be audited.EDIT: The Zeppelin team contacted me and explained they were in fact hired to do the audit, it was just the blog post that had a misleading introduction.Special security needs for this project? 3/5 In general I would say no. But, given the extreme max cap on this projects it makes it another to big to fail project (if they raise the full amount). Can the community afford another security breakdown of this size?Conclusion 2/5With the information available in these sources I have a very hard time understanding this project. They have a nice website and clearly ambitious plans, but they do not seem connected to reality. The tone I see in Romans AMA answers remind me of the tone Stephan Tual held before theDAO debacle. I think a lot more openness, transparency and community engagement is needed.  I have several direct issues with the project:They don\u2019t give backgrounds of the team and only two people seems to be working on the projectThey don\u2019t give any information about the governance of the company that will be in control of all fundsVery vague rationale for how investors will get an ROI on their investmentThey have no strategy for how funds will be efficiently used in the wide range they are asking forNo company formation strategy, no market strategy described and no plan for an efficient team setupThe only security audit so far is done by a friend of the project/teamThe token issuance model could have been made much better in order to allocate funds to everyone interestedThe white paper and the website are still unfinished and are missing contentOn the other hand, a successful ether.camp could mean a lot to the Ethereum ecosystem. I just wish they could follow some of the best practices developed in the real world. Raise some seed money, build a first version, prove that the team can execute and then go from there.Another important note, it seems like the HKG tokens and the project tokens they potentially can be exchanged into are never intended to carry any value \u2014 meaning that investing in ether.camp is not to be done if an ROI is expected on the investment.", "responses": 1, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Ethereum", "The Crowdsale Analyst"]}, {"title": "Why Ethereum (ETH) not being a security is a big news?", "post_link": "https://medium.com/hackernoon/why-ethereum-not-a-security-by-sec-big-news-e90aff0fdfbe?source=search_post", "author_name": "Vamshi Vangapally", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@vvkr", "publish_date": "2018-06-14", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-20", "readtime": "2.44", "claps": 112, "voters": 11, "content": "Why Ethereum (ETH) not being a security is a big news?Are bitcoin and ether securities? Finally, one of the biggest questions and debates in crypto has been answered by the SEC, officially. Here\u2019s a detailed insight on why this announcement is such a big news for traditional and cryptocurrency investors.Vamshi VangapallyFollowJun 14, 2018 \u00b7 3 min readAnnouncementAs per Yahoo Finance, In an announcement at Yahoo Finance\u2019s All Market Summit: Crypto in San Francisco on Thursday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Director of Corporate Finance William Hinman said that the commission would not be classifying ether or bitcoin as securities.Photo by Mike Enerio on UnsplashCommentsHinman said that the SEC will not be changing cryptocurrency and digital asset rules, but rather would be applying them. Previously, bitcoin and ether may have been offered as securities (like shares of a company), which would have required registration with the SEC, but a consensus has emerged that they behave and are treated like commodities,similar to gold and oil.What\u2019s a Security and why\u2019s this such a big news must be everyone\u2019s question!What\u2019s a security?This is how SEC looks at it \u2014 Howey\u2019s test.If a buyer Invests moneyIn a common enterpriseExpecting a profitPredominantly from the effort of others.Then whatever buyer is buying is a security and comes under the compliance of SEC (in the USA) and anyone\u2019s who\u2019s offering it needs to be registered with SEC.Now with the above announcement of Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH) not a security, will not need any registration with SEC.Hinman\u2019s argument that Ethereum is now sufficiently decentralized to disqualify it from a securities classification appears to indicate that the altcoin will be given the all-clear and not be subjected to heavy regulation by the SEC. \u2014 CTWhy this is a big news?This news will definitely clear some concerns and questions around the acquisition or trading of Ethereum or Bitcoin. With this, a lot of institutional investors, traditional investors and those who are skeptic about the future of these major crypto-currencies due to the involvement of SEC can now have a sigh of relief. It\u2019s not that SEC is bad, but they all seems to be scared about the kind of hard decisions which could affect prices drastically and potentially make their investments worth $0.Now, they can buy without worrying much about any sudden regulatory surprises or compliance related news coming out of the blue.This reduces the volatility in prices of Ethereum and Bitcoin, also reduces manipulation by mis-interpretations of different media across the world.This will also mean a clear road for CBOE and CME to launch futures on Ethereum.

Some companies more, some people more, some less. Fortunately, TenX did not have anything stored in a Parity multi-signature account. We are close to the Ethereum ecosystem, so this sort of affects us as well. There are many companies that we know of that are affected by this.In this video, I want to talk about \u201cWhy did this happen, How did this happen, and what does it mean.\u201dEven though this is not directly related to TenX, it highlights certain thought processes with regard to security procedures and audits. While we did not know that this was possible, we did see some red flags. After the attack in June, they redeployed the Parity multi-signature feature. There were some problems, but before I go into the details, let me briefly provide some context. Ethereum has many different wallet providers. Gavin Wood, one of the original co-founders of Ethereum, is one of the people who founded the Parity project. Parity is written in Rust.Some people attribute this to Solidity being a difficult language to code in, but I feel that one of the reasons why this occurred might be because of a lack of auditing. One important thing that I want to highlight is that Parity is not Ethereum. The challenges that plague Parity are not the challenges that Ethereum face. Currently, approximately half a million Ether, 150 million dollars, are stuck and cannot be moved.Unless the entire Ethereum community decides to implement a hard fork and release these funds, they are lost for good. This problem does not lie with Ethereum. Parity is the one responsible for the stuck funds, and Parity is not Ethereum. Parity is a node, not Ethereum.I feel that the ecosystem handled the situation well. Despite the problem, the price of Ethereum did not fall, but increased instead. This demonstrates the strength of the ecosystem, being able to withstand such an event.How did this occur? Why did such a huge amount of money suddenly become stuck?This is how it happened.If you have a Parity multi-signature wallet, this wallet has a library that it needs to access. The library works similar to that of a smart contract. Somebody is the owner of the smart contract. The problem here was that the ownership was uninitialised. This means that there was someone who modified the contract. The person claimed ownership and deleted the library. This is what developers do. They look for bugs, they test things. Once this person deleted the library, but having the ownership, all of the wallets that require that library can no longer function. The question is, why was the smart contract not initialised?This is very similar to the event in June, where the init function was set to \u201c1\u201d. This meant that anybody could just claim ownership. For some weird reason, something similar is happening. All these multi-signature features are still there, but nobody can move the money anymore because the library has been killed.What is the solution?The solution is to implement a hard fork and undo this, similar to how the DAO happened. There has been a lot of discussion on the internet. My personal opinion, and this is not the company\u2019s opinion, is that bad code must die. While this incident may be unfortunate, at the end of the day, we need to make sacrifice for progress to occur. I totally understand that you might support a hard fork, but where do we draw the line? For example, Swarm city lost a lot of money in June to these hackers, why should they not get their money back? In my opinion, code is law, because otherwise we do not have to be part of the blockchain ecosystem.Bad code must die. I truly believe this. Once again, this is my personal opinion, not the company\u2019s opinion.Let me know in the comments below, if you agree or disagree.Lastly, how does this affect us at TenX, and why do we do videos on topics like this?We care because it shows that how important great developers such as Gavin Wood and the entire Parity team are necessary for the blockchain ecosystem to succeed. By the way, if you are from Parity and you know how to code in Rust, we are looking for developers. I\u2019m just kidding. Of course we would be happy to have you because we are always looking for talented individuals.On a more serious note, it shows how important it is as a company to have good security processes, especially in an industry like Financial Technology. You always need to be aware of the possible scenarios and reflect on the best and worst case scenarios. I think TenX has done a great job navigating such pitfalls and facing such challenges. We are really proud as a company, because we have been pushing the boundaries. Everyone will make mistakes, and I think we have done a great job limiting our mistakes.Let me know in the comments below if you agree or disagree with me, or if you have any questions. If you are a Rust developer, reach out to us at jobs.tenx.tech, we would love to have you on our team. This is not a hiring video by the way, I just threw that in.Please subscribe to our channel, we have more of these videos where we talk about TenX and the entire crypto ecosystem.See you at the next video,Yours Truly,JulianIf you want to keep up with our latest progress please:Join us our community chat on RiotFollow TenX on FacebookFollow TenX on TwitterSubscribe to the TenX subredditSubscribe to us on YouTube", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Cryptocurrency", "Ethereum", "Parity", "Tenx"]}, {"title": "Update log 21.01.2018: Trade, lending, transfer, release & In-game ERC20 token", "post_link": "https://medium.com/etheremon/update-log-21-01-2018-trade-lending-transfer-release-in-game-erc20-token-f56f77b9bb3f?source=search_post", "author_name": "Etheremon", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@myetheremon", "publish_date": "2018-01-21", "last_modified_date": "2018-04-28", "readtime": "2.33", "claps": 225, "voters": 8, "content": "Update log 21.01.2018: Trade, lending, transfer, release & In-game ERC20 tokenEtheremonFollowJan 21, 2018 \u00b7 3 min readThe past week has been ups and downs for Ethereum holders, but at the end, one good thing comes out of it: a very low Gas price. That means our beloved MonSeekers can finally enjoy Etheremon without worrying too much about transaction fee. For developers like ourselves, this is a good time to deploy new contracts.Today, we are pleased to announce our next big features: trade, lending, transfer, and release; together with our new in-game currency: Etheremon Token (EMON).Trade, lending, transfer, and release:This update introduces several ways to move your Etheremons:Trade: sell your Mon in the marketplace. Once sold, that Mon will no longer be in your possession. Note: Gen-0 Etheremons will carry their eggs with them after being sold.Lending: lend your Mon out for a limited amount of time. The rented Mon can be used to attack (but NOT defend) castles or to help other Mons transform (to be introduced next update). After the lending time runs out, you can make another transaction to reclaim that Mon.Note: Etheremons on trade/lending order cannot be used to defend a castle.Transfer: transfer your Mon to another MonSeeker for free.Release: release your Mon into the wild. This action is permanent, so please be careful!Please read our guide here on how to perform these actions.2. Etheremon ERC20 Token:We are proud to introduce our in-game currency: EMON - an ERC20 token! EMON is essential to our game, fueling all in-game operations starting with building castle. Being an ERC20 token, EMON is transferable and limited. There are only 20 million tokens created, distributed as below:70% or 14 million: to be \u201cmined\u201d by MonSeekers during in-game operations. From this update, winning a battle against a castle is rewarded with 1 token. After all tokens are mined, the game will be self-sustainable and operated entirely with EMON tokens.25% or 5 million: reserved for our User Growth Pool.5% or 1 million: reserved for the development team.You can check your EMON token balance on My Mon page. This token will be updated on Etherscan and MyEtherWallet next week.3. Changes to castle mode:As EMON token is introduced, there are some changes made to castle mode:Each time you attack a castle, if successful, will be rewarded 1 EMON.Destroying a castle no longer yields any additional reward.You can create a castle with Ether or EMON (but not a mix of both). The minimum price for a castle is 10 EMON, each additional brick costs 2 EMON.Successfully defending 8 battles still rewards 1 brick to your castle. However, the maximum number of bricks rewarded is equivalent to the number of your castle\u2019s starting bricks.Note: If you have unused bricks, please email us at contact@etheremon.com with title \u201cExchange bricks for EMON\u201d, so we can send you an adequate amount of EMON (=2 * number of bricks).\u2014 \u2014 \u2014Follow us atOfficial Website: https://www.etheremon.comFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/etheremon/Tweeter: https://twitter.com/myetheremonReddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/etheremon/Email: contact@etheremon.com", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Etheremon", "Ether", "Game", "Ethereum"]}, {"title": "The Ether Review #61 \u2014 The Biggest City in Blockchain", "post_link": "https://etherreview.info/the-ether-review-61-the-biggest-city-in-blockchain-92b101fc93b5?source=search_post", "author_name": "Arthur Falls", "author_link": "https://etherreview.info/@arthurfalls", "publish_date": "2017-04-12", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-15", "readtime": "1.50", "claps": 11, "voters": 11, "content": "The Ether Review #61 \u2014 The Biggest City in BlockchainArthur FallsFollowApr 12, 2017 \u00b7 2 min readLast week I was honoured with the privilege of representing New Zealand at the inaugural ISO/TC-307 Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technologies standards committee meeting. The event was hosted by the secretariat, Standards Australia. 18 nations attended. The event itself will be the subject of a blog post when I get around to writing it.While at the meeting, blockchain legend Nick Addison wrangled together a who\u2019s who of blockchain entrepreneurs for a round table discussion. We convened in the media room at the international convention center. The group grew piecemeal over the course of three hours during which we discussed everyone\u2019s projects and the state of blockchain in Australia.The attendees were:Tim Bass of Block 8Bok Khoo of the Internet, and Bok ConsultingSam Brooks CTO of VeredictumRussell Mclernon of RexmlsLuke Anderson of Sigma PrimeSergei Sergienko of ChronobankMatt Hale of DivviConspicuously absent were Chris Mountford of DAH, Conor Svenson.I\u2019ve split the conversation into two episodes and there will be a separate one with Nick Addison because, well, this is Nick Addison we\u2019re talking about here. Before we get stuck in, I want to draw your attention to the Blockchain NZ conference and the Auckland and Wellington Blockchain Meetups. Things are gathering pace down here and with Vitalik soon to grace our shores with his presence, the whole country is abuzz. You can pick up conference tickets at a discount by following this link. I\u2019ll be there and everyone will be invited to my place for a barbecue in the days following.So let\u2019s hear from they guys in Sydney. First up we have Tim Bass, on joint real estate investing, then Bok Khoo on decentralized exchanges and derivatives markets. After some general chat Sergei discusses Chronobank and Russell explains Rex before we move into discussions about usability, insurance and end user friendly key management. Finally, Sam outlines the steganographic processes behind the operation of the Veredictum anti-piracy platform slated to launch later this year.https://itunes.apple.com/podcast/the-ether-review/id899090462?mt=2", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Bitcoin", "Ethereum", "Distributed Systems", "Podcast"]}, {"title":

SecuritiesBy Steven Krohn on ALTCOIN MAGAZINESteven Krohn | Krohn MediaFollowOct 5, 2018 \u00b7 4 min readA few months ago, there was a big debate over the nature of cryptocurrencies. The regulators began to tighten the restrictions on crypto trading. Both the supporters and opponents of digital media were looking to ask one major question.Are Cryptocurrencies a form of financial securities?The Nature of CryptocurrenciesCryptocurrencies and digital coins have been compared to a lot of things. Bear in mind that Bitcoin was initially envisioned as a type of digital currency that would one day replace fiat currency.Bitcoin and other digital coins can offer the three fundamental characteristics of currencies. They can be a store of value, a medium of exchange and a unit of accounting.One of the prime drivers toward Bitcoin adoption was that it was similar to a financial instrument.Other crypto platforms like Ethereum, Dash and Ripple were similar in many ways . When these platforms were launched, their developers advertised that the coin would be introduced on the public exchanges.Hundreds of millions dollars were being raised and investors had the freedom to trade their holdings on the virtual exchanges.These properties of crypto coins convinced many people that digital currencies were similar to a stock exchange. On the one hand, this gave a lot of credibility to crypto coins.If these coins were similar to financial securities, then they were considered a safe investment option.When Bitcoin was first listed on CME and CBOE in December 2017, it was hailed as a victory by crypto enthusiasts. They saw it as the first major step toward wider adoption of crypto coins.However, if digital currencies WERE SIMILAR to financial securities, then an objection was raised. Shouldn\u2019t they be subject to similar checks and regulations as any other financial security would be?Enter the SEC RegulatorsThe SEC first started getting involved with cryptocurrency in March in reviewing the practices of crypto trading. It determined that cryptocurrencies identified similarly to other financial securities, would be subject to SEC laws.Enter June 2018. William Hinman, head of the Division of Corporation Finance at the SEC, declared that crypto coins, such as Bitcoin and Ether, were not securities. However, he also observed that a number of other ICOs and blockchain projects do fall in the category of financial securities.Thus they would be subject to SEC laws.What is central in determining whether a cryptocurrency is a security? Simply, it\u2019s how the coins are being sold along with the reasonable expectations of the investors.When an entity offers an ROI for the sale of coins, it\u2019s to be considered a financial security.Decentralization in Crypto PlatformsThe issue with cryptocurrencies is that for most platforms there is no centralized management. In a regular corporation, the management tends to make the decision of how the raised capital will be utilized.They also decide how new capital will be added to the total.Crypto platforms, like Bitcoin, are decentralized with no governing body. New coins are added by a decentralized ledger maintaining a network of nodes.No one knows who or where the developer/company is that backs the project The SEC ruled that it was sufficiently decentralized to not be considered financial securities.Ethereum on the other hand is slightly more complex. The network is currently decentralized while the Ethereum Corp. has very little control. The initial funding raised for the network can be considered similar to an ICO launch.The SEC has also clarified that current trading in Ether cannot be classified as financial securities That said, the platform allows other tokens to be built on top of the Ethereum network.Any project that raises and sells tokens using the Ethereum platform could be considered financial securities. That means being subject to SEC regulations.The Implication of Financial Securities StatusGiven the status of financial securities is both a good thing and a bad thing. If a new token is declared a security, they must abide by all the rules and regulations of the SEC.This would make it more difficult for start ups to raise capital online. You would expect this to drive away new companies and investors.The news is not all bad though. Being considered a security asset will give more credibility to the platform.It may open the doors for other investors who want a safer, lower risk investment.. Compliance with government regulations will make it much more effective in raising finances.In The EndThe classification of crypto remains unclear and murky at best.One would think that he affect on the markets can only be negative.Contact Us For ICO/Crypto Advisor, Influencer or Digital MarketingSource: https://krohn.media/bitcoin-ether-financial-securities/Before moving on, make sure to press follow, leave a clap or 46, share today\u2019s highlight and if you missed last week\u2019s article, click here.Follow us on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, and join our Discord.The purpose of ALTCOIN MAGAZINE is to educate the world on crypto and to bring it to the hands and the minds of the masses.

Anyone with less than 10 years of programming experience should ask a friend for help as soon as they get stuck.Buying the etherHead over to ethereum.org and click buy ether:Read and accept the user agreements to reach the registration form:A very strong password is required. I use LastPass to generate mine. Because we\u2019ll be encrypting our wallet using an additional password later, I won\u2019t consider this one very sensitive.Send the requested amount of bitcoin to the address, in my case 0.01 BTC. I use the Blockchain.info or Hive apps for Android, which both support sending funds to QR codes.The payment has already been registered by the website and we can proceed to download the wallet file.The file, ethereum-wallet-xxx.json is encoded in a popular format called JSON.It\u2019s not formatted for humans, but if we pretty it up a little it looks better:It contains a few values, encseed, bkp, ethaddr, btcaddr, and email. I haven\u2019t taken the time to read up on the format, but I assume that encseed is encrypted seed (private key) of our Ethereum wallet. It\u2019s probably encrypted with the password we used in the registration form.Encrypting the walletThis is where the more technical part starts. I\u2019m sure there are other ways of doing this, but by using tried and trusted unix command-line tools, we can be confident that the backups can be restored no matter how much time passes.If you\u2019re on OSX or Linux, the command line tools will already be installed on your system. If you\u2019re on Windows, like me, we\u2019ll be using cygwin, which lets us run linux programs.You might want to ask a friend who knows Linux to help you with the steps. It\u2019s not necessary to reveal the passwords to your friend at any step.Open a terminal/cygwin window and change the current directory to where you downloaded the wallet:$ cd /cygdrive/c/users/Andreas/Downloads/Verify that the wallet file is present:$ ls ether*ethereum-wallet-bd08e0cddec097db7901ea819a3d1fd9de8951a2.jsonAs you can see, the wallet is named ethereum-wallet-bd0\u2026json on my system. We\u2019ll rename it to ether.json to make things a little shorter:$ mv ether* ether.jsonAnd confirm that the file was renamed:$ ls -lh ether.json-rwxrwx\u2014-+ 1 Andreas None 1.5K Jul 24 16:24 ether.jsonI use the command ls -lh to see the file size as well as the name. We see that my file is called ether.json and is 1.5K bytes (1500 bytes).First, we\u2019ll encrypt the file with the des3 algorithm. At this point you must invent a very strong password. I\u2019ll be using the password phrase correct horse battery staple without spaces, correcthorsebatterystaple. I\u2019ll refer to this password as the paper password, as opposed to the wallet password from the registration form.Encrypt the ether.json file with DES3 and store it in ether.json.des3:$ cat ether.json | openssl des3 > ether.json.des3enter des-ede3-cbc encryption password:Verifying \u2014 enter des-ede3-cbc encryption password:Let\u2019s look at the des3 encrypted version:The file is now in binary and cannot easily be displayed in our terminal or printed on paper. The square looking characters are the ones that have no visual representation.This makes printing the encrypted wallet a problem.Luckily, there are tools to convert binary data to more readable formats. We'll use a tool called xxd which limits the character set to 0-9 and a-f:$ cat ether.json.des3 | xxd -p -c40 > ether.json.des3.xxdWe\u2019ve now created a pretty good looking textual representation. Open up the file, called ether.json.des3.xxd, in Word and decrease the font size to 9 so that the lines fit:I usually write a note at the top or the bottom of the files so I don\u2019t forget what format they\u2019re in.I usually also include the names of family members who I told the password and the date of creation.Now, the most important step. Print on a physical printer. Don\u2019t feel tempted to store on Dropbox or a USB stick.You should print a couple of copies and give one of them to your mom. Let\u2019s verify that it works. I\u2019ll pretend like we typed in the entire sequence of characters to a file called restore.txt using Notepad and opened up a shell window:As you can see, the file was decrypted as expected using our paper password and the original contents of our wallet is outputted.Optional: Encoding using QRThe printed format above is excellent because it\u2019s exact. The only issue is that it would take very long to type. Finally, for the first time of your life, QR codes are useful. We\u2019ll first encode the binary file, ether.json.des3 using a format called base64 and then create a QR code.$ cat ether.json.des3 | openssl base64 -A > ether.json.des3.b64Open up the file, ether.json.des3.b4, in a text editor such as Notepad:$ notepad ether.json.des3.b64The file is 1976 bytes, in my case, which is quite large for a QR, but not close to the limit of around 4000 bytes. Copy the entire file to your clipboard (Select All, Copy)Head over to http://goqr.me/ which has an easy to use QR Code generator. I\u2019ve already pasted my clipboard into the text box:Click on the Download button, copy my settings and download as PNG:Create another Word document and insert the QR code you just downloaded:As before, the most important step is that you print the code!It is a bizarrely enormous QR code and I\u2019m not sure any QR code scanner can read it.My scanner, called Barcode Scanner (Android) reads it after holding the camera over it for a few seconds and trying different angles.Because we\u2019ll need to verify that everything can be decrypted, I send the code to myself with email.I copy the entire contents of the email to my clipboard and save it to a file named qr.txt using a program such as Notepad.Now, for the moment of truth. We\u2019ll decrypt the file, qr.txt and retrieve the original Ethereum wallet:Flawless victory! We\u2019ve scanned the QR and decrypted using the paper password to retrieve the original wallet.Destroying all the evidenceThrough this process, we\u2019ve managed to store quite a bit of digital evidence that a hacker can use to recover and steal our wallet. We\u2019ll need to find and delete all of it:Find the email of the QR code we sent to ourselves and permanently delete it from your email.2. Find the email of the wallet that ethereum.org sent you and permanently delete it from your email.3. Delete all the files we used:Andreas@Laptop /cygdrive/c/users/Andreas/Downloads$ rm ether* qr.txt restore.txt4. Set your printer and laptop on fire and kill any witness, human or otherwise.As a last note, I actually included my wallet password (not paper password) on the print outs as I do not consider them to be sensitive. You can decide this part for yourself.As you may have noticed, no passwords have been censored from my post. Once Ethereum is launched, you can have the 20 ether \u2014 if you're fast!I hope you enjoyed this tutorial.

It\u2019s gotten even easier since then. This reflects the rapid advancement in the cryptocurrency world, which is good news for the cryptocurrency consumer.If you didn\u2019t live in New York, buying Ether in USD wasn\u2019t too hard. You could buy Ether on many of the cryptocurrency exchanges. The Bitlicense in New York made things harder for those of us who live here.The Bitlicense and Centralization of Decentralized PotentialBecause of the Bitlicense, Gemini Trading, owned by the Winklevoss twins, was the only game in town when it came to buying Ether in New York State. Gemini Trading was the only exchange licensed by New York to trade in Ether at the time.Centralizing all this power at one company felt contradictory to me. I\u2019m interested in cryptocurrency\u2019s potential to democratize financial freedom through decentralization.(I saw, first-hand, the uneven distribution of wealth during my time as a management consultant for the financial industry. It\u2019s caused by the centralization of financial services.)I wanted to find a way to support decentralization. That meant not using Gemini Trading. I found a way to buy Ether in USD, living in New York, without using Gemini. It was a little complicated.Coinbase Makes Buying Ether in USD EasierThat post is now outdated. A second exchange, Coinbase, is now approved to trade Ether, even in New York State. Now anyone can establish an account on Coinbase and buy Ether with USD.Coinbase is my public exchange of choice. I like that Fred Wilson\u2019s Union Square Ventures is a Coinbase investor. I\u2019ve admired Fred for a long time.His vote of confidence in Coinbase gives me confidence in Coinbase as a company. I\u2019m glad to see Coinbase supporting the purchase of Ether in USD, even in New York. It represents a positive step in making cryptocurrency more available to the average consumer.P.S. \u2014 Want to use Coinbase to buy Ether in USD?

These and other regulatory differences, compounded by the stable and already-decentralized nature of Swiss government, make Switzerland the ideal jurisdiction for Crypto Valley, the rapidly growing successor to Silicon Valley based in Zug, a financial center.Alongside its long list of clients, MME is now focussed on creating Blockchain Crypto Property (BCP) standards. The final BCP paper, to be published in August, will classify tokens under a range of asset classes and outline a quality checklist for various token models.

A hacker allegedly switched the Ethereum address on the ICO fundraising website, scamming over 2,000 potential investors into sending over 43,500 ETH to the wrong address.Around the middle of July, when reports of the hack first appeared, Etherium was trading for about $155 per unit, which would have made the heist worth over $6.7 million. The value of ETH has since exploded, and the haul would be worth $37.7 million as of writing.However, in an unlikely twist, the hacker decided to return some of the funds back to CoinDash. The first sum of 10,000 ETH was returned back to CoinDash in September 2017, while the cryptocurrency portfolio management company reported that the same hacker had returned 20,000 ETH last Friday.On February 23, the date when the second tranche of stolen ETH was returned, it would have been worth $16.1 million.The hacker, whose identity still has not been revealed, was under no obligation to return any of the funds, and no details about why he or she may have undertaken this inexplicable gratitude were forthcoming. The hacker still has about 13,500 ETH, which is worth about $11.7 million at time of writing.CoinDash insists that it is proceeding with the rollout of its cryptocurrency trading platform, scheduled for February 27, 2018, despite any stolen funds. The product will automate integration of Ethereum-based wallets with cryptocurrency exchanges Bittrex, Binance, and Poloniex, which was recently acquired by another company for $400 million.#w12 #ico", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Ethereum"]}, {"title": "Ethereal", "post_link": "https://medium.com/haiku-hub/ethereal-60cbdb217107?source=search_post", "author_name": "Esther Spurrill-Jones", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@estherspurrilljones", "publish_date": "2019-04-11", "last_modified_date": "2019-04-11", "readtime": "0.39", "claps": 382, "voters": 12, "content": "EtherealA response to the Haiku This!

This comment was filed in regards to this Request for Information and can be found in its original submission here.Understanding Ether \u2014 The World\u2019s First Digital CommodityA Brief Background:EtherIndex registered its S-1 with the SEC in the summer of 2016, hoping to be the first ETF to track the price of the cryptocurrency ether. While the filing still remains in the registration process, we have been diligently working behind the scenes to educate regulators about ether and to help build the decentralized applications which give ether value. The questions posed by the CFTC are poignant, and while I cannot provide sufficient answers to all, my hope is to create an image in your minds through concrete examples. To knock a couple of the easier questions out of the way:(1) In regards to the questions on the subject of \u201cCyber Security and Custody,\u201d ethereum is built upon an extremely similar set of cryptographic primitives to bitcoin and for all intents and purposes can be secured and custodied in identical methods.(2) In regards to the questions on \u201cGovernance,\u201d the ethereum blockchain currently uses an extremely similar consensus mechanism to bitcoin, i.e. proof of work, and therefore has a nearly identical governance process to bitcoin. As it pertains to the current chain and its relation to the chain known as ethereum classic, the current chain has always been the \u201cvalid\u201d one and shouldn\u2019t be considered an outgrowth of ethereum classic \u2014 while on a technical level they did once share a common history, the chain today has always retained both developer mindshare and users, the only two metrics that actually matter.(3) In regards to the questions on \u201cMarkets, Oversight and Regulation,\u201d there is essentially no difference between the underlying markets on bitcoin and the underlying markets on ether.The Utility of EtherEther has two main sources of utility. One is its use as the fuel of the network, i.e. if you want to execute a transaction on the network, you must pay for that transaction in ether. This source of utility has a direct correlation with the usage of the network itself. Its growth can be seen in the following chart:(Note: in ethereum, transaction fees are paid in a metric called \u201cgas\u201d, which is exclusively priced in ether)(Chart courtesy of etherscan.io)The other source of utility for ether is using ether as a value deposit in more complex systems. Thus far, the most successful applications on ethereum have been in a new business vertical call \u201cDecentralized Finance,\u201d DeFi for short. The following chart shows the success of DeFi and its utilization of ether as a value deposit:(Chart courtesy of Mike McDonald)As can be seen in the above chart, using ether as a value deposit in other systems has currently locked away just about 2% of all ether in existence (with no signs of slowing down).So What\u2019s Happening Here?In the \u201cETH locked in DeFi\u201d chart, you can see 5 applications listed \u2014 Maker, Augur, Compound, dYdX, and Uniswap. Maker allows you to borrow dollar-pegged tokens against your ether in order to gain liquidity or leverage, while buyers of these dollar-pegged tokens gain a decentralized stable store of value and medium of exchange. Augur allows you to bet on the outcome of virtually any event and resolves bets with a unique decentralized resolution system. Compound allows users to lend their cryptocurrency to each other in a p2p fashion. dYdX facilitates the creation of synthetic assets, their most popular being a token which represents a short position on ether. Finally, Uniswap allows you to instantly trade tokens with an automated market maker in a completely trustless and decentralized fashion.What do these applications have in common? Well for one, they are all seeking to disrupt legacy financial players by offering cheaper decentralized alternatives to existing products. But more importantly for the purpose of this commentary, they are providing tremendous demand for ether through their utilization. Each time a user interacts with any of the above applications, they must pay a small fee in ether to the network. This contributes to the \u201cDaily Gas Used\u201d chart. Second, all of the above applications require ether to collateralize their contracts. Maker requires borrowers to deposit a minimum of 150% of their loan in ether, Augur takes bets only in ether (for now), Compound also requires over-collateralization for its p2p loans, dYdX requires ether collateralization for its \u201cshort tokens\u201d, and Uniswap forces its liquidity providers to always denominate their trades in ether. In summary, each application requires a decentralized store of value that is native to the network on which it operates.In ConclusionTo retain brevity in this commentary, I was only able to scratch the surface of the innovation brewing in the ethereum ecosystem. The point I wish to highlight is that decentralized applications have arrived and the demand to use them is growing every day. These decentralized applications must use ether for security, and often use it in a far more implicit way. Ethereum is the only blockchain that has seen this kind of non-speculative usage, and that is why ether should be considered the world\u2019s first digital commodity.Thank you,Gregory Di PriscoCEO, EtherIndex LLC", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Ethereum"]}, {"title": "The Ether Review #75 \u2014 Streamr, Completing the Data Services Trifecta", "post_link": "https://etherreview.info/the-ether-review-75-streamr-completing-the-data-services-trifecta-f1fbeaec170?source=search_post", "author_name": "Arthur Falls", "author_link": "https://etherreview.info/@arthurfalls", "publish_date": "2017-10-11", "last_modified_date": "2018-05-02", "readtime": "0.53", "claps": 141, "voters": 7, "content": "The Ether Review #75 \u2014 Streamr, Completing the Data Services TrifectaArthur FallsFollowOct 11, 2017 \u00b7 1 min readCurrent solutions for decentralized data processing like Golem or Truebit provide part of a data services solution.

The dispute began in November 2016, when the IRS summoned Coinbase to hand over data about all users who were active on the exchange from 2013 to 2015, with a view to investigating the tax compliance of individuals who have transacted in cryptocurrencies.On behalf of one or more anonymous Coinbase users, BernsWeiss took the issue to court and was recently granted permission to argue against the summons, which among other things demanded access to users\u2019 public and private keys. If complied with, this would effectively give the IRS access to all customer funds, making it a clear and easy target for hackers.This is an unprecedented use of the John Doe summons procedure, which was intended for situations where the IRS has identified specific tax avoidance but can\u2019t identify the specific parties who have engaged in that illicit conduct. If determined to be legal, this summons would set a precedent under which the IRS could demand the same from other exchanges. BernsWeiss intends to continue fighting this massive government overreach unless and until the IRS can identify a specific subset of taxpayers who it is reasonably certain are engaging in tax avoidance.After the hearing, the government removed the request for private keys, now only requiring public keys. The IRS also voluntarily narrowed the scope of the summons to only cover individuals who engaged in virtual currency transactions in excess of $20,000 in a given year. This figure is likely arbitrary, and suggests that the government is simply trying to gather as much information as possible rather than engaging in a specific investigation.This case illustrates the lack of understanding about these new financial instruments within government. With this summons, the IRS effectively places virtual currencies into the \u201cinherently suspicious\u201d tax avoidance category with things like large transactions, questionable tax shelters, and other mechanisms which are clearly designed to avoid taxes and typically don\u2019t have a legitimate purpose \u2014 unlike cryptocurrencies.Berns Weiss LLPtwitter.com/BernsWeissconsensys.netconsensysmedia.netetherreview.infohttps://itunes.apple.com//podcast/the-ether-review/id899090462?mt=2", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Bitcoin", "Coinbase", "Ethereum", "Podcast"]}, {"title": "#Ether 7: Video walkthrough of DAO simple proposal tutorial", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@makoto_inoue/either-7-video-walkthrough-of-dao-simple-proposal-tutorial-253c0d1a7f13?source=search_post", "author_name": "makoto_inoue", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@makoto_inoue", "publish_date": "2016-04-02", "last_modified_date": "2018-05-19", "readtime": "1.83", "claps": 7, "voters": 7, "content": "#Ether 7: Video walkthrough of DAO simple proposal tutorialmakoto_inoueFollowApr 2, 2016 \u00b7 2 min readWhen you send money from one account to another, you are interacting with human. In the world of Ethereum that may not be the case.Decentralized Autonomous Organization(DAO) sounds very complex and difficult but it\u2019s basically like a bot on a chat system.Example requesting hubot chat bot (https://github.com/shokai/hubot-rss-reader) to get rss listA bot reacts to your request based on the certain predefined rules. In case of Ethereum, it enables you to interact with the DAO contract with money (with their own currency Ether). You can deposit pool of money and each member of DAO can propose and vote how the money should be spend. You can code your contract to make the decision in the democratic manner without human intervention. This may open up a lot of possibility and I am super excited to be bale to experience how it works.In this video walk through of the Ethereum\u2019s DAO tutorial, we only cover the basic proposals as follows.1. Create a \u2018Congress\u2019 contract (just like you created the token contract)2. Watch someone else\u2019s contract using \u2018interface file\u2019 and \u2018address\u2019.3. Add a member to the contract.4. Send some money to the `Congress` account as deposit.5. Propose to send some of the deposit to another account.6. A member vote for the proposal.7. Once the deadline is passed, the proposal can be executed.There are a couple of things I learnt while going through the tutorial.8. An error is raised when non member tries to vote. The rule is enforced because it goes through onlyMembers modifier as part of newProposal function.function newProposal(  // some arguments)  onlyMembers  returns (uint proposalID) { // some code}If you look into the onlyMembers code, you can see that it throw if msg.sender is not the member./* modifier that allows only shareholders to vote and create new proposals */modifier onlyMembers { if (memberId[msg.sender] == 0  || !members[memberId[msg.sender]].canVote)  throw; _}It is very powerful to be able to write a code that allows you to pool and distribute money with total strangers without any authorities.

There is also no sure way to determine the performance of portfolio managers in the digital asset space. Melon solves these problems:by allowing portfolio owners to maintain control of the digital assets contained therein, while allowing a manager to adjust the exposure to each asset.By tracking the performance of individual asset managers using the provability, provable history of the Polkadot protocol.What factors have converged to create a need for Melon?There is already a wealth of valuable digital assets emerging as a result of the development of blockchain.

If you already know how to purchase Ethereum, you can move on to step three, on how to purchase YUP. If you wish to learn more about our company or our ICO click here.In this article we will focus on how to purchase Ethereum (ETH) on Coinbase. If you are at this stage you have already created your wallet.We decided to use Coinbase because it is quick, simple and has great customer support, but there are multiple exchange websites you can purchase cryptocurrencies from (such as Poloniex or Kraken). It is worth checking to see if the website supports the country you are residing in, if not you cannot use Coinbase, you can use Poloniex or Kraken as they follow a very similar procedure.Please also note that due to the rapidly increasing interest in digital currency trading, the exchanges could be temporarily unavailable on some days. Do not worry if this happens, your money is still safe even if the website is unavailable. Also the verification process can take a few days so please be patient, this is down to the ever increasing interest around cryptocurrencies.Step 1Firstly we will need to create an account on Coinbase and verify your account. To start this process, go the website https://www.coinbase.com/ and enter a email address you want the account to be connected to, after entering your email address click \u201cget started\u201d.Once you have clicked \u201cget started\u201d you will taken to the page that is below, enter your details, and click \u201ccreate account\u201d to proceed. Once you click \u201ccreate account\u201d an email will be sent to your address which needs to be opened to verify your email address.Once you have verified your email address, you will have to verify your account. It is a simple procedure, but it can be time consuming. For this you will have verify your phone number, provide an ID and send a send a confirmation payment.It is not uncommon to have a few issues during this process, this is due to high level security and wanting to make sure that your account is secure. If your ID gets rejected, use a different ID. One of the reasons we picked this site was because of the great customer service they provide. If you have any issues you can go Coinbase support portal or get in contact with them.Depending on what country you are situated it, you can buy digital currency using either a credit card or a bank account transfer. Using a credit card is faster, but here at Crowdholding we suggest adding a bank account, so can buy a larger amount and also withdraw your funds to your bank account in your local currency. For this guide, we will focus on a bank account transfer.Step 2Once your account has been verified you are ready to purchase some Ethereum! To get started you will need to fill your local currency wallet, which will appear under your account if you have added a bank account from a supported country. Sign in to Coinbase, click on the \u201cAccounts\u201d tab and look for \u201cUSD Wallet\u201d or \u201cEUR Wallet\u201d.Select either your USD or EUR wallet, and on the next page click the icon \u201cDeposit\u201d that is located on the right side of the wallet. When you click this, a pop up will appear and will show you all the details of your Coinbase account (this is where you will be depositing your local currency, so you can purchase a digital currency). Once you confirm this and you bank process your transaction, you are ready to purchase!Your bank details will be on this pop upOnce your wallet has been filled with your deposit, click the \u201cBuy/Sell\u201d tab. Choose Ethereum as the currency you wish to purchase, choose your wallet as the payment type, and then select the amount of ETH you wish to purchase. Once you have selected all the correct items, click on the \u201cBuy Ethereum Instantly\u201d button and confirm your order on the next page.Step 3Once you have purchased some Ethereum in your Coinbase account, it is time to send your digital currency to your own Ethereum wallet. Click on the \u201cSend / Receive\u201d tab open a pop up form allowing you to send funds.On this pop up, copy your public account address from your personal Ethereum wallet. In the amount section, enter the amount you wish to transfer from your Coinbase account to your wallet.We would suggest that you double check that you have the correct public address, as it is a long line of random numbers and letters, and getting this wrong will send it to another account or it will not work.When the transaction is completed, your purchased Ethereum will appear in your wallet. If you followed our first part and created a wallet on MyEtherWallet, you can check your balance by clicking on \u201cView Wallet Info\u201d. You will have to unlock your wallet again by typing in your Keystore file and password.Well done! You now have some Ethereum in your created wallet and you will be able to use your new digital currency to become a Crowdholding supporter!In our next step, we will be showing you how to change your Ethereum into YUPIES.

He came across the word Ethereum and he liked it more in comparison with all the other words as this word consisted of another deep word, Ether. Ether refers to the hypothetical invisible medium which permeates the universe and permits the light to travel. This is how Buterin came to a decision of naming his network Ethereum.Vitalik Buterin is a known Russian-Canadian writer and programmer who is primarily recognized for being the co-founder of Ethereum. He also happens to be the co-founder of a magazine called The Bitcoin Magazine.Vitalik first described Ethereum on a white paper in the late 2013s. He founded Ethereum as he felt that Bitcoin needed a scripting language for the specific application development. But, he failed to gain the agreement. After this, he proposed the development of an entirely new platform that consisted of a more general scripting language.EthereumIt all started with the existence of Bitcoin. Cryptoassets had become entirely synonymous to Bitcoin for many people, with an idea of digital money and rising a market capitalization of around $100 billion. The second most considered valuable asset is Ether. It became popular due to Ethereum, which is a software that runs it. Ethereum was first released on July 30, 2015.Ethereum is a public, open-source, blockchain based distributed computing platform and is also the operating system that features smart contracts on a functional basis. Ethereum supports a better and modified version of Nakamoto consensus through state transitions based on transactions.The blockchain of a cryptoasset known as Ether is created and generated by Ethereum. Ethereum provides the decentralized Turing-complete virtual machine, the EVM, also known as Ethereum Virtual Machine, that can also execute the scripts using an international network of public nodes. The internal transaction pricing machine that is utilized to mitigate spam and allocate resources on the network is known as Gas. Gas is not a asset, rather is a measurement unit regarding the transaction. Gas price is decided by the sender, but the miner will define the order of execution of the transactions.During the time of a public announcement in January 2014, there were only four people in the core team of Ethereum, namely, Vitalik Buterin, Mihai Alisie, Charles Hoskinson, and Anthony Di Lorio. In early 2014, the formal development of Ethereum software project began, through a Swiss company, Ethereum Switzerland GmbH. The fund for the development was generated by an online crowdsale which happened between July and August in the year 2014. In this crowdsale the participants purchased Ethereum value token (Ether) with the help of another digital asset, Bitcoin. The entire system went live on July 30, 2015, with around 11.9 million coins for the crowdsale. The DAO project collapsed in 2016 due to which Ethereum was split into two separate blockchains. The new version was known as Ethereum and the original one continued to be known as Ethereum Classic.In 2017, the value of Ethereum asset grew to be over 13,000 percent! Here\u2019s another in-depth look at this rising cryptoasset.Also Read:RBI vs Cryptocurrency Exchanges: Supreme Court to Hear Plea on 20th JulyThe holiday bench of the Supreme Court has refused to hear the plea for interim relief.

Realising the importance of such a system for the whole ecosystem, they partnered with AngelList to develop this into a platform on which other projects can host their token pre-sales. The end result, CoinList, streamlines the complicated token launch process for developers and investors alike.By supporting a wide variety of sale mechanics, contracts, and pricing schemes within a standard set of requirements, the platform allows developers to focus on optimising their projects instead of spending time on convoluted compliance processes. Its focus on simplifying due diligence reduces complications for developers while \u201cfiltering out the signal from the noise\u201d.With the ability to clear transactions simultaneously across fiat and cryptocurrencies, and the aim of hosting high-quality and high-integrity projects, CoinList opens up the token ecosystem to an influx of capital from a range of new investors. It gives these investors visibility into the progress of a sale, a clear quality checklist for each token, and a record of their previous investments and the requisite legal agreements.The significant institutional capital still pushing into the cryptocurrency space highlights the demand for such a versatile yet user-friendly platform at this time. With its solutions to regulatory uncertainty, costly compliance and the current knowledge barrier to investing, CoinList is well-placed to bring in the era of Web 3.0.coinlist.cotwitter.com/coinlistangel.cotwitter.com/angellistprotocol.aitwitter.com/protocollabstwitter.com/juanbenettwitter.com/jesseclayburghpolychain.capitalangel.co/polychain-capitaltwitter.com/ryanzurrerconsensys.netconsensysmedia.nethttps://itunes.apple.com//podcast/the-ether-review/id899090462?mt=2", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Podcast", "Blockchain", "Cryptocurrency", "Investment", "Ethereum"]}, {"title": "Ethernaut Lvl 7 Force Walkthrough \u2014 How to selfdestruct and create an Ether blackhole", "post_link": "https://medium.com/coinmonks/ethernaut-lvl-7-walkthrough-how-to-selfdestruct-and-create-an-ether-blackhole-eb5bb72d2c57?source=search_post", "author_name": "Nicole Zhu", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@nicolezhu", "publish_date": "2018-08-23", "last_modified_date": "2018-09-17", "readtime": "2.97", "claps": 31, "voters": 6, "content": "Ethernaut Lvl 7 Force Walkthrough \u2014 How to selfdestruct and create an Ether blackholeThis is a in-depth series around Zeppelin team\u2019s smart contract security puzzles.

Unlike other transactions, selfdestruct() consumes negative gas \u2014 so think of it as a garbage collection incentive to clean up void contracts.When to selfdestructContract owners typically include a selfdestruct option to be called in the following scenarios:To deprecate buggy contracts: When there is a bug or undesired aspect of a smart contract, the creators can then destroy the contract and forward remaining Ethers to a backup address.To clean up used contracts that become obsolete. This is seen as a best practice to free up storage on Ethereum blockchain.A example of how selfdestruct is often implemented:function close() public onlyOwner {    //recommended: emit an event as well    selfdestruct(owner);}The selfdestruct option makes everything ok when it might not beFun fact: selfdestruct is currently 1 of 3 methods for your contract to receive etherMethod 1 \u2014 via payable functions: Earlier, we discussed that the fallback function is to intentionally allow your contract to receive Ether from other contracts and external wallets. But if no such payable function exists, your contract still has 2 more indirect ways of receiving funds:Method 2 \u2014 receiving mining reward: contract addresses can be designated as the recipients of mining block rewards.Method 3 \u2014 from a destroyed contract: As discussed, selfdestruct lets you designate a backup address to receive the remaining ethers from the contract you are destroying.Caution: be careful about forwarding the selfdestructed ethers to any smart contract.In this level, we forward Ethers to an empty contract with no withdrawal or transfer capabilities. This means we\u2019re effectively dumping test ethers into a blackhole \u2014 never to be used again.

Currently, it simply follows the trend of all the alt coins, when the BTC dominance surge to 54.9%, becoming the primary refuge value. 14 months ago, at the bottom of the dip, the ETH had plunged around 170 USD when the BTC was down to 1900 USD. This morning the rate is 225 USD to 6400 USD.Therefore, the gap on ETH is still huge and the current dip is mostly tied with the crisis on the utility tokens ERC20. It is the tsunami we were all waiting for and which will finish purging tokens with no future or profitable model. Once their liquidities will be down, they will simply disappear and leave the space open to other projects with better potential. Like the Augean stables have been cleaned in one day by Hercules, most of current alts coins will disappear because they won\u2019t have reached sufficient liquidity guarantees. This situation is not new and ongoing for the last 3\u20134 months. However, now the market cap is nearing 14 months lows, that will bring the liquidities and daily trading of some alts to extreme lows to the point they will not be even tradable (which doesn\u2019t mean the business model of some of the projects won\u2019t work, they will simply use more liquid tokens like ETH and BTC). A low of 4500 for BTC and 150 for ETH would completely finish the job of wiping the unnecessary tokens from the market cap listings.On the contrary, the press is pointing at technical issues and adoption rather than market analysis and avoiding the ugly truth that 90% of alts coins do not have a sustainability model. Instead, many arguments have popped up against the long term sustainability of Ethereum: gas fee, scalability etc\u2026 Those are true issues that have been raised. We may have asked too much too soon. But let\u2019s think rationally for a moment.Most of the best coders are working on enhancing Ethereum network. ETH has the 1st moving advantage. An experience in handling heavy transactions but also in scaling when a problem raises (cryptokitties feb. 2018). They have updates in progress. They have a strong cohesion of the development team compare to many others. And finally, we continue to see the adoption of this Blockchain by many companies and governments. Ether has never been as used as it is now. Maybe someday another project will overpass ETH, but for long months or even years to come, the Ether will still be the reference token used for smarts contract.This is only the beginning of the story (for Ether and others). Tokens and ICOs are not dead, it is only the dream of raising millions with just a Whitepaper and a website that has vanished. And this is a good thing.

The current price of Ether as I write this post is positioned at $182.Next I will ponder on how the price increase affects us and is it really good for Ethereum?Crypto-currency traders consume happiness. The price rise of the Ether means that the traders who are leaning towards the value investment with Ether are indeed in a good position now since Ether has risen to highest value since the beginning of the Ethereum.Price rise is generally seen as positive impact. It is quite commonly accepted that Ether value increase is good for the Ethereum. Even during the Consensus 2017 meeting this may, someone of the crowd mentioned that ETH was record high. The statement was followed by applause.Now as we know, the Consensus has a great amount of Ethereum blockchain developers. What came to my mind was whether there is an opinion amongst the Ethereum developers that Ether price increase is good for the Ethereum or to the Ethereum developers themselves?Price rise is not a problem? I remember Vitalik Buterin writing that users can bare the increasing gas fees on transactions on the Ethereum network, and further addressed that the waiting period for getting the transaction confirmed is something that bugs the user more than the tiny gas fees.How much is too much? I do agree that the gas fees are quite bearable and important for the Ethereum security. However, we should mind that the increase of ETH value shall mean that users get less ETH compared to Fiat currencies. This is because we are living (still) in the Fiat world and the economy is run by Fiat (hope this changes soon) currency since most of the salaries are paid with Fiat. This means that when ETH price rises, I have to pay de facto more on transaction fees and for creating contracts.For example, when today at high Ether price I was creating a loan request on EthLend, I noticed an interesting point.The max transaction fee was 0.045150 Ether which amounts to $8.24 when converted on today\u2019s high Ether price. Of course, we are discussing on Max Transaction Fee which on execution would amount to a little above $6 with the current high price.Hmm\u2026 this makes me wonder\u2026 who is getting the cold shower here? The developer that has a nice innovative solution or the user who just simply wants to use the application?Now, we are factually dealing here with a simple loan contract. It does not have much information, although it runs fully on Ethereum blockchain. My point is that contract formation is not free. And as the Ether price rises, so does the price for kick-starting a smart contract.High Ether price would shape the user base. When we created EthLend we wanted something that is simple and accessible for the wider Ethereum audience. If the Ether price does rise it means that the use cases will most likely consists of loans that are more than equivalent to $500 or even $1,000. The conclusion would be that bigger loans make sense, smaller not so much.The real issue comes with the complex contracts. Our simple lending smart contract is nothing compared to complex contracts that innovation furnishes. I think that the real issue or barrier might be seen on these more complex and demanding contract creations.However, some wise men and women have once said that you should not put everything on-chain. Well, sometimes having something fully decentralized is more than showing the middle finger towards the centralized system that we live in today\u2026 What do you think?", "responses": 2, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Ethereum", "Smart Contracts", "Ether", "Cryptocurrency"]}, {"title": "Ether Review Legal #6 \u2014 Playing in a Sandbox", "post_link": "https://etherreview.info/ether-review-legal-6-playing-in-a-sandbox-be9ddec64ad1?source=search_post", "author_name": "Arthur Falls", "author_link": "https://etherreview.info/@arthurfalls", "publish_date": "2017-09-14", "last_modified_date": "2018-04-17", "readtime": "0.98", "claps": 56, "voters": 5, "content": "Ether Review Legal #6 \u2014 Playing in a SandboxArthur FallsFollowSep 14, 2017 \u00b7 1 min readIn today\u2019s long overdue, landmark episode we are joined by an international panel of leaders in fin-tech and blockchain law:Claire Wivell, Hannah Glass (Australia), Alex Simms (New Zealand), Peter van Valkenburgh (USA), and James Duchenne (USA/Mauritius)The theme for the discussion was regulatory sandboxes \u2014 frameworks for enabling businesses to operate in a deregulated environment.

Want Snippets delivered to your inbox, a whole day earlier? Subscribe here.This week\u2019s theme: how Tim Wu\u2019s The Master Switch helps us frame one important similarity between two debates raging today: Twitter Safety and Net Neutrality. Plus some good numbers out of Box and Bustle.Last week in Snippets, we talked about the power and paradox of information empires: how networks from the telegraph and radio to TV and social media act as \u201cheavy\u201d infrastructure on top of which \u201clight\u201d information can flow freely. Today\u2019s epidemic of tribalism as entertainment, and the \u201ceverything is sports\u201d phenomenon (with fans, storylines, media participants, and so much more), are in many ways inevitable consequences of this light/heavy quality of today\u2019s information networks. We\u2019ve been talking about this theme over the last several weeks in order to develop some perspective on the question we initially started with: how should the government address fake news, hate speech, and other consequences of \u201clight\u201d tribalism on social media\u2019s heavy infrastructure? Can Google, Facebook and Twitter realistically do anything about it? What is likely to happen, and what ought to happen?Today, we have two current debates about Rights and Freedoms on information networks going on in parallel. First, we have the free speech / hate speech debate on social platforms like Twitter: should Twitter be completely neutral as to what gets said on its platform? Or does it have a responsibility to monitor what\u2019s being said, suspend or ban people from posting threats or other problematic content? (In other words, \u201callocate network resources away from people saying things we don\u2019t like?\u201d) And second, we have the net neutrality debate going on one level down the stack: can carriers like AT&T and Comcast treat some traffic on their network differently than others? Is it fair to suggest that these two debates are about the same thing: \u201cFreedom from being discriminated against\u201d from the perspective of the user, and \u201cFreedom to allocate my network\u2019s resources as I see fit\u201d from the perspective of the underlying platform? How should today\u2019s information platforms be treated differently as common carriers compared to, say, the railroads that we learned about a few weeks ago, or even the media networks of a decade ago?The point we\u2019ll explore this week is how both of these debates, as they proceed in parallel, show us something interesting about freedom on information networks. It\u2019s hardly a new issue; the free speech on common carriers question has existed since their origin with the telegraph, and that has continued across many different forms of media through the decades. Tim Wu\u2019s book The Master Switch is one of the best starting points for understanding how these information empires come together and fall apart, and is highly recommended topical reading for all Snippets readers over the holiday season if you haven\u2019t read it already.One of the more subtle but crucial underlying themes in Wu\u2019s book has to do with the societal norms around the free and unrestricted use of information networks. As information networks rise and fall, from time to time we get inevitable conflict between platform operators who want to allocate resources in a way that restricts or silences some of its users, and those users who protest in response. In the United States, we have a pretty strong tradition of siding with whichever side of a conflict gets to claim \u201cFreedom\u201d as theirs. (A few weeks ago, for instance, we talked about how tobacco companies began to lose influence when freedom from addition and secondhand smoke became major talking points among the opposition.) But sometimes, as Wu points out, information networks evolve in a way where spontaneous free expression on the airwaves gets sidelined and silenced due to structural shifts that rearrange the information landscape, in what\u2019s framed as a \u201cresource allocation issue\u201d rather than a free speech one. Consider, as Wu writes, what happened in the early 20th century when the Federal Radio Commission made the decision to shut down local radio stations across the country with General Order Number 40 to \u201creset the radio dial\u201d by clearing the airwaves for larger, national commercial broadcasters:\u201c\u2018There is not room in the broadcast band for every school of thought, religious, political, social, and economic, each to have its separate broadcasting station, its mouthpiece in the ether.\u2019 So declared the commission in the course of shutting down a well-known station in Kansas famous for its medical quackery.What is immediately striking about this pronouncement is how much it reads like a calculated antithesis of the First Amendment. Less visceral analysis reveals it to be based on a false technological premise. It is true that interference was a problem. Without any order to the radio dial, no station could be heard. But the FRC had a real choice of whether to back more low-power stations, or fewer high-power stations. There was, in fact, room on the broadcast band for every school of thought, if broadcast rights were confined to localities and lower-wattage transmitters. It was simply a matter of how one envisioned dividing up the ether.\u201dWhat\u2019s striking about this example, and many others that you can read about in The Master Switch, is that how the question framed at the beginning absolutely matters, because the initial discussion shapes what happens next. If it\u2019s framed as a free speech issue, then it becomes about free speech, and free speech typically wins in the United States. But if it\u2019s framed as a resource allocation issue, even if the outcome means that some people\u2019s speech becomes effectively silenced, then we see it as an economic tradeoff: away from many distributed chattering voices, and towards a smaller number of national-scale broadcasts.The question we\u2019ll leave with today is this: thirty years from now, another book like the Master Switch will be written about today\u2019s social media, net neutrality, and information empire conflicts. We\u2019ll have the hindsight of looking back on Facebook, Twitter and AT&T the same way we can look back in hindsight on RCA, NBC and a previous generation\u2019s AT&T a century ago. Will we look back at the Net Neutrality debate, from our future vantage point, as having gone down the Free Speech Issue path, or the Resource Allocation path? What about fake news and the light tribalism we learned about last week? Some issues, like safety on Twitter, are clearly about freedom rather than resources: sure, ther might be a theoretical argument that censorship on Social Media is \u201callocating scarce space on the feed selectively\u201d, but you\u2019ll probably have a hard time finding too many people who\u2019ll go along with that. And Net Neutrality, at least for the time being, appears to be headed down the \u201cNetwork operators will be able to allocate their resources as they see fit\u201d path. But what about fake news, and light tribalism? To what extent do we believe that Facebook, Twitter and our other Social Media infrastructure companies will go the same way as the information empires of decades past?

They include tools like photo tagging using Google\u2019s Cloud Vision API, an audio transcription service, and other neat tools for content managers and Box customers more generally. CEO Aaron Levie, who has seen Box grow from its tiny origins to the great success story it is today, is overall very optimistic about Box\u2019s progress and long-term durability, calling their latest numbers \u201cReally really good spot from a cash generation standpoint.\u201d Congratulations to everyone on the team at Box, and keep up the great work.Speaking of good numbers, Bustle continues to break from the pack in digital media, posting strong numbers in what is otherwise looking like a troubling year for digital media:Bustle eyes more deals with revenue on pace to rise 50% | Lukas Alpert, WSJCEO Bryan Goldberg expressed optimism about the months ahead in a recent WSJ profile, noting that although others in the space may be missing their aggressive revenue targets, Bustle is exceeding theirs while running very close to cash flow break-even. In his words, \u201cNow is this critical make-or-break moment for the industry where digital media needs to consolidate.

The halting problem states you can\u2019t predict what a turing complete program will do, until you run it. This means to some degree, that you can\u2019t predict what your \u201csmart\u201d contract will do, until it does it. Thus turing completeness causes security to be far, far harder than non turing completeness. This is how you lose the millions of dollars as the DAO did after it passed audits.2. Competing implementations of consensus code in different languages greatly increases breakdown of consensus. (more millions have been lost over this, and it created a fork at about 10 percent the value of the old chain.)3. You can buy things with bitcoin. What can you buy with ETH? If you can\u2019t buy anything with a currency, it\u2019s not a currency.Thus, human resolved chain rollbacks? Check. Failed consensus between implementations? Check. Passed audit yet totally failed smart contracts? Check. No place to spend them? Check. New tokens given out all the time forever? Check.Every dollar that goes into bad ideas is taken directly from the good ideas. Smart contracts can never be smart until oracles are solved. Oracles aren\u2019t solved.

Since my previous blogpost, Ethereum had another leg up, sending the entire crypto market cap close to 40 billion.What are the factors behind the rise of this blockchain stock?Where does it go from here?In this post, we shall explore in depth the possible contributors to Ethereum\u2019s success.Designed for Something GreaterBefore Ethereum even existed, there was Bitcoin. Bitcoin, since its inception in 2008, has been hailed as the most radical development in currency. On 2nd March 2017, and for the first time in history, a digital asset with no intrinsic value climbed above the price of gold. As Bitcoin\u2019s price took the limelight over the years, it was easy to overlook Bitcoin\u2019s underlying blockchain technology \u2014 blockchain as a tool of distributed consensus. Vitalik Buterin, however, was one of the early few who saw the potential of blockchain development, and thus Ethereum was born.Ethereum was not made to compete with Bitcoin. For the most part, Ethereum is a blockchain-based decentralised platform for apps that run smart contracts, and is aimed at solving issues associated with censorship, fraud and third party interference. Ether, also known as \u2018gas\u2019, comes in as a necessary element for operating the distributed application distribution platform, Ethereum.In short, Ethereum does everything that Bitcoin can do, and more. If Bitcoin warrants a market cap of 23.6 billion USD, how much further can the price of Ether go, with Ethereum market cap standing at a mere 7 billion USD?The Bitcoin Hard Fork ContentionPart of Ethereum\u2019s rise in price and interest could be attributed to the instability of Bitcoin in March, which has quite a bit of a backstory. Due to increasing Bitcoin usage, an increasing number of transactions are getting backlogged. As Bitcoin scurries to resolve this, two solutions surfaced: activate Segregated Witness or increase the block size. Both options tackle the Bitcoin network congestion, but unfortunately, the bigger miners have an interest in the latter: increasing the block size makes it harder for smaller miners to run a node on the network, which encourages centralization. Till now, the Bitcoin scaling issue is still present without a clear plan. Investors who were unsure of Bitcoin\u2019s direction would have hedged into Ethereum, driving up demand for Ether.The DAO AttackBitcoin is not the only cryptocurrency with issues; Ethereum has had its fair share of problems to deal with as well. \u2018The DAO\u2019 is a decentralized autonomous organization that raised over 150 million USD, making it the largest crowdfunding in history. On 18th June, a hacker managed to drain 3.6 million Ether from the fund into a \u2018child DAO\u2019 by exploiting a loop hole in smart contract terms. Following the incident, price of Ether dropped from 20 USD to 13 USD and below, reflecting the confidence of investors in the Ethereum network. That put the Ethereum Foundation in a tough spot. They do not wish for the smart contracts platform to be viewed as a failure, but if they do intervene to save the funds, they risk a possible reputation damage by not upholding their social contract with their network of independent nodes. In the end, the foundation handled the hack decisively with a swift and clean hard fork that created ETH (Ethereum) and ETC (Ethereum Classic). Nevertheless, the incident left a mark on Ethereum\u2019s once untainted reputation.The DAO hack might have set back the price of Ether a few months. The dent in the public\u2019s confidence in Ethereum translated into a supressed Ether price much like a coiled spring, until the end of February when the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) was announced.Forming of the Enterprise Ethereum AllianceThe intense bull run of Ether in March is triggered by the announcement of EEA partners. The EEA initiative connects Fortune 500 enterprises and academics to support the development of enterprise-grade revolutionary software based on blockchain technology. The EEA launch saw big names such as Accenture, Microsoft, Intel, JP Morgan and UBS. It was jaw dropping; no one expected a cryptocurrency to receive that level of institutional support. Given that the companies were largely interested in Ethereum as a blockchain technology development platform and not Ether per se, this public display of confidence in Ethereum as the leading blockchain for future businesses was enough to send the price of Ether on a relentless climb.Empowering DevelopersEthereum has built a community around developers who are devoted to bringing smart contracts mainstream. Ethereum has its very own language, Solidity, for writing smart contracts with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The EVM is the primary innovation of the Ethereum project and can run code in a quasi-Turing complete manner. The Learning resources and code repositories are well documented and easily available on the web. By encouraging knowledge exchange, Ethereum makes developing decentralized apps (Dapps) enjoyable and exciting.Currently, Ethereum has a huge lead in blockchain development and innovation. With a fast expanding developer base, it is only a matter of time before Ethereum-based Dapps crowd the top crypto scene.Ethereum-based DappsUnlike that of Bitcoin and its clones, the relationship between Ethereum and its Dapps is symbiotic. Dapps such as Golem, which creates a decentralized sharing economy of computing power; Augur, which creates a decentralized prediction market; Melonport, which removes third parties and decentralizes asset management. Instead of in-fighting for a piece of market share in the crypto space, these Dapps seek to add value to our world by having real usage cases, expanding the Ethereum network and reach in the process. It is no wonder that the price of Ether, which acts as the fuel for the network, increases with the proliferation of its Dapps.All the Pieces Coming TogetherIt is an exciting year to be holding Ether in your investments. On May 4th, we have Ethereum Naming Service coming online, which will let us bid for URL addresses ending with .eth soon. Next, we have the highly-anticipated EEA conference to announce new corporations coming on board. Then we have the Raiden release, which will make payment in Ethereum fast, scalable, confidential and interoperable. Lastly, we have Metropolis and Serenity updates, not forgetting the Casper update that will change Ethereum\u2019s protocol from Proof of Work (Pow) to Proof of Stake (PoS) or hybrid PoS/PoW.If the technical jargon is too much to handle at this point, just remember that lots of good news about Ethereum is coming, all of which will undoubtedly increase the value perception of Ether. Ultimately, remember that the crypto space is still predominantly running on speculation. Ethereum\u2019s road map looks promising and personally, that is enough for me to take an interest in and invest in ETH.Be it up or down, the crypto investing journey has always been wild and violent.You have been warned, buckle up and hold on tight. :)", "responses": 1, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Ethereum", "Cryptocurrency", "Bitcoin", "Bitcoin Mining"]}, {"title": "1 Bitcoin Is Not 1 Ether Is Not 1 EOS", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@goenkas/1-bitcoin-is-not-1-ether-is-not-1-eos-dc79c8144132?source=search_post", "author_name": "Sandeep Goenka", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@goenkas", "publish_date": "2018-07-26", "last_modified_date": "2018-07-26", "readtime": "1.59", "claps": 55, "voters": 4, "content": "1 Bitcoin Is Not 1 Ether Is Not 1 EOSSandeep GoenkaFollowJul 26, 2018 \u00b7 2 min readA common fallacy in the crypto community is to compare prices of cryptocurrencies in non standardized units.Prices As Per Coinmarketcap.comComparing the price of 1 Bitcoin to 1 Ether to 1 EOS is not accurate. The unit does not take into account the total supply of the cryptocurrency. Issuers of new cryptocurrencies know this. It is common for ICO issuers to have a supply far higher than of bitcoins so that the price per unit of the new cryptocurrency is lower than that of a bitcoin. The assumption is that users would feel that since the price per unit is low, there is a lot of upside possible.As an example, below is the total supply of ether and EOS compared to bitcoin:Bitcoin: 21 millionEther: ~ 100 millionEOS: 900 millionPrice of Bitcoin, Ether and EOS:1 Bitcoin: $8,2001 Ether: $4801 EOS: $8.50From the above prices, a subconscious assumption one makes is that Bitcoin is priced at 16x of Ether and 1,000x of EOS.However, a more accurate price comparison would be if the units are standardized. What if all other cryptocurrency units were standardized to compare with 1 bitcoin as below:1 Ether = 21,000,000 (total Bitcoins) / 100,000,000 (total Ether) = 0.21 b-Ether (Bitcoin standardized Ether). Or 1 b-Ether = 4.76 Ether.1 EOS = 21,000,000 (total Bitcoins) / 900,000,000 (total EOS) = 0.023 b-EOS (Bitcoin standardized EOS). Or 1 b-EOS = 42.86 EOS.So if prices are mentioned as per Bitcoin standardized unit, they will be:1 Bitcoin: $8,2001 b-Ether: $2,285 ($480 * 4.76 Ether)1 b-EOS: $364 ($8.50 * 42.86 EOS)Factoring in the total supply of the cryptocurrency in the price, price of a bitcoin is 4x of Ether and only 20x of EOS.The implementation of Bitcoin standardized units would have some challenges like in case of cryptocurrencies in which the supply is not fixed, or coins can be destroyed and so on. However, these are minor issues and can be ironed out.I hope that someday, Bitcoin standardized unit becomes the general way by websites, wallets, exchanges and the entire community to mention prices.", "responses": 1, "tags": ["Bitcoin", "Cryptocurrency", "Cryptocurrency Investment"]}, {"title": "I was asked on Quora: How should I distribute my budget between Ether, Dash and Monero, in percentages?", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@TimothyLea2/i-was-asked-on-quora-how-should-i-distribute-my-budget-between-ether-dash-and-monero-in-8a22153695fe?source=search_post", "author_name": "Tim R.

LeaFollowMay 7, 2017 \u00b7 3 min readHere is my answer \u2014 but please note this is not investment advice\u2026 please do your own research\u2026I think it is important that before you make any assessment of your distribution that you assess are you a long-term or a short-term holder, what your risk apetite is by having a large percentage in any given cryptocurrency and that you do your due diligence to understand as much as you can about all altcoins as well as the ones you are suggesting.Please note: nothing below is investment advice \u2014 you MUST do your own research \u2014 the cryptocurrency space is unregulated and high risk to the uninformed and naive.Each of the 3 has core drivers that will drive their respective growth:Ethereum : this is the favoured cryptocurrency outside of Bitcoin. It is an operational currency that is building an ecosystem and a longer-term platform that corporates are well and truly buying into \u2014 especially given the recent Ethereum Alliance announced. Ethereum is the undoubtedly the favoured developer community cryptocurrency (c 10,000 developers + already on board and growing every day). There are visions behind Ethereum that are far broader in scope than just a cryptocurrency to trade. Many very successful ICO\u2019s are based around Ethereum and there is plenty of news to come over the coming months. As a long-term hold, in my opinion only (do your own research), this is a very strong cryptocurrency and should feature strongly in any portfolio.Dash: I am increasingly liking Dash especially with its committment to instantaneous payments . This makes it a practical cyrptocurrency in that funds are cleared immediately (at an extra cost) rather than having the risk of waiting for consensus to happen and funds cleared with either Ethereum or Bitcoin \u2014 currently at least. With Bitcoin best practice is to wait at least 30 mins for clearance \u2014 which doesn\u2019t work if you want to buy a coffee. I was talking with one of the organisers of the bitcoin meetup group here in Sydney and he was absolutely pro Dash- indicating a number of European ATM\u2019 s now making dash and bitcoin available and the currency increasingly being increasing being seen at retail outlets. On-line this appears to be confirmed and if this continues and the network effect can be seen to increase, Dash could be VERY interesting in the longer run.Monero: Personally, I am not a fan of those coins that want to hide identity. Privacy I get \u2014 secrecy I don\u2019t. In the pragmatic environment of fear and paranoia around terrorism, secrecy only has bad outcomes. For me when the regulators get involved, which is, when not if, in my view they will focus first on the anonymous coins \u2014 after all how do you tax them, how do you identify any bad actors? It would not surprise me to see the mining, ownership and exchanging of these coins made illegal \u2014 although enforcing this will be very hard I accept. Clearly in the darknet and the TOR this style of cryptocurrency is very heavily used to hide identity. As a result, for me this is the highest risk coin of the three you have identified.As for the allocations \u2014 that comes down to your own risk appetite, and your willingness to have too much exposure in one cryptocurrency. Personally I am diversified so I am not too exposed to any single cryptocurrency \u2014 the space is fraught with risk \u2014 so whatever allocation you make be very careful \u2014 it just takes something from left-field to happen and the overall space is badly affected.Longer-term Monero is the highest risk, Ethereum the lowest. Personally I view longer-terms risks \u2014 where say 100% is highest risk I see :Ethereum \u2014 35%Dash \u2014 50%Monero \u2014 75%But it is your call alone as to how you allocate these cryptocurrencies in your portfolio.Tim LeaAuthorDown the Rabbit Hole", "responses": 5, "tags": ["Bitcoin", "Blockchain", "Ethereum", "Monero", "Dash"]}, {"title": "OpenBazaar 1.1.10 Released \u2014 Purchase with Ether, Monero and More Via ShapeShift.io Integration", "post_link": "https://medium.com/openbazaarproject/openbazaar-1-1-10-released-purchase-with-ether-monero-and-more-via-shapeshift-io-integration-3ee02311dc5?source=search_post", "author_name": "OpenBazaar", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@therealopenbazaar", "publish_date": "2016-12-20", "last_modified_date": "2017-04-27", "readtime": "1.42", "claps": 5, "voters": 5, "content": "OpenBazaar 1.1.10 Released \u2014 Purchase with Ether, Monero and More Via ShapeShift.io IntegrationOpenBazaarFollowDec 20, 2016 \u00b7 2 min readToday we\u2019ve released version 1.1.10 with a special integration that we are excited to share.

Thousands of companies have launched their own cryptocurrency as a way of funding their business. These so called utility tokens don\u2019t always hold the best interest of both parties.In the beginning there were companies like the Ethereum Foundation. They would launch a token with which users could use to pay for transaction fees on the network. The fees would go to the miners that support the security of the network. These miners could then sell the token back to the users to pay for the costs they are accruing to secure the network. At its core this could be understood as a fair business structure for the miners, users and Ethereum foundation\u2026 except for the fact that users didn\u2019t realize that they were donating to the Ethereum foundation instead of investing in it.When investors buy stock they buy the rights of future dividends. By estimating the future dividends of a company, investors have a way to value its stock. This is why start-ups without any revenue often receive multi-million (or even billion) valuations. Investors are betting on the potential return of a company, postured against the relative risk of that companies failure.With the current Proof of Work (PoW) consensus, the amount of computing power that someone contributes to the Ethereum network is in line with the amount of voting rights he or she has. In this way, holders of Ether tokens neither get paid through transaction fees nor have voting rights on the network.Then, why do people invest in Ether?In 2017 the Ethereum Foundation announced that it will begin conversion towards Proof of Stake (PoS). This gives holders of the Ether token certain entitlements in respect to transaction fees and voting rights. When this will happen is still unknown. Details about the Ethereum PoS can be found on the Ethereum PoS FAQ page.The change from PoW to PoS has obvious benefits for investors in Ether. This makes Ether a reasonable investment if you compare it to other utility tokens.In the next article I will explain why nearly all utility tokens are bad investments and why companies that issue them are scamming the market.If you like this post, follow me here on Medium, Facebook and Twitter or download the Coinstack app for more articles about cryptocurrencies.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Ethereum", "Proof Of Work", "Proof Of Stake"]}, {"title": "SEC Rules Ether not a Security, Markets Explode", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@w12.io/sec-rules-ether-not-a-security-markets-explode-6555a216ad28?source=search_post", "author_name": "W12", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@w12.io", "publish_date": "2018-06-15", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-17", "readtime": "1.77", "claps": 20, "voters": 3, "content": "SEC Rules Ether not a Security, Markets ExplodeW12FollowJun 15, 2018 \u00b7 2 min readWhether or not Ether is sanctioned as a currency under US jurisdiction has been a major point of speculation and uncertainty since the SEC first began its more active stance on cryptocurrencies and ICOs. As the Ethereum platform represents one of the first major ICOs, the future of platform rested majorly on the SEC\u2019s interpretation of it.Just hours ago, the SEC ruled that Ether is not a security. William Hinman, head of the Division of Corporation Finance at the SEC, explained that securities are largely determined by the manner in which they are sold and the expectations that sale entails. Because Ether was distributed in a decentralized manner, and contributions were not met with expected returns, ETH, in the eyes of the SEC is not a security. \u201c\u201dIf there is a centralized third party, along with purchasers with an expectation of a return, than [sic]it is likely a security. The key here of course being that Ether is decentralized,\u201d said Hinman.The market instantly responded to this news. Ether immediately reacted with a US$50 gain, from $470 to $520. It currently rests at $515 and seems poised for further growth. Among top 100 coins by market cap on Coinmarketcap, all lie in the green over the past 24 hours. While the 10% ETH climb is substantial, it is being outpaced by 40 coins among the top 100. ICON (ICX) is leading the show with a 22% climb over the past 24 hours.To maintain SEC compliance, a number of criteria must be met, including a yearly US$1 million license fee to the SEC. As such, essentially all ICOs have elected to simply bar access to US investors or ignore the jurisdiction of the SEC. Of course, as the US is taking an increasingly active stance on crypto, most projects are starting to equate an approach of ignorance to one of suicide. Shipchain\u2019s recent cease-and-desist exemplifies the danger in such a stance.If Ether were to be labeled as a security, then it would stand to reason that each of the hundreds of ICOs operated through the Ethereum network, as ETH tokens or otherwise, would similarly be labeled as securities. For most ICOs, meeting SEC standards, especially with that yearly US$1 million, would be impossible. And for many that could comply, doing so may seriously cripple their project in the long term. Today\u2019s SEC ruling has, at least for now, protected the longevity of numerous projects.Source", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Ethereum", "ICO", "Token", "Btc", "Blockchain"]}, {"title": "", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@GatotSoedarto/albert-einstein-began-by-rejecting-the-ether-theory-2e0d8ff8a812?source=search_post", "author_name": "Gatot Soedarto", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@GatotSoedarto", "publish_date": "2016-04-08", "last_modified_date": "2018-05-20", "readtime": "4.73", "claps": 5, "voters": 4, "content": "Gatot SoedartoFollowApr 8, 2016 \u00b7 5 min readAlbert Einstein Began by Rejecting the Ether Theory\u2026\u2026\u2026The luminiferous aether: it was hypothesised that the Earth moves through a \u201cmedium\u201d of aether that carries lightThe classical scientists such as Aristotle, Rene Descartes, Sir Isaac Newton and others believed that the light of the stars reaching us on earth crept spreading through a medium the so-called luminiferous ether. However various kinds of experiments had been made, among other was an experiment conducted by the American Scientists Michelson and Morrey 19th century, and all of those experiments failed to detect the presence of luminiferous ether, so that the ether is deemed non-existent. There is a possibility that luminiferous ether truly exists, but it cannot be proven.\u201cLuminiferous aether, aether or ether, meaning light-bearing aether, was the postulated medium for the propagation of light.It was invoked to explain the ability of the apparently wave-based light to propagate through empty space, something that waves should not be able to do. The assumption of a spatial plenum of luminiferous aether, rather than a spatial vacuum, provided the theoretical medium that was required by wave theories of light.The concept was the topic of considerable debate throughout its history, as it required the existence of an invisible and infinite material with no interaction with physical objects. As the nature of light was explored, especially in the 19th century, the physical qualities required of the aether became increasingly contradictory. By the late 1800s, the existence of the aether was being questioned, although there was no physical theory to replace it.The negative outcome of the Michelson\u2013Morley experiment suggested that the aether was non-existent. This led to considerable theoretical work to explain the propagation of light without an aether.\u201d(wikipedia)In 1905 Einstein rejecting the ether theoryAlbert Einstein rejecting the ether theory can be read on the book \u2018Universe and Dr.Einstein\u2019, by Lincoln Barnett, London, 1949, page 38.\u201cAmong those who pondered the enigma of the Michelson-Morley experiment was a young patent office examiner in Berne, named Albert Einstein. In 1905, when he was just twenty-six years old, he published a short paper suggesting an answer to the riddle in terms that opened up a new world of physical thought. He began by rejecting the ether theory and with it the whole idea of space as a fixed system or framework, absolutely at rest, within which it is possible to distinguish absolute from relative motion. The one indisputable fact established by the Michelson-Morley experiment was that the velocity of light in unaffected by the motion of the earth. Einstein seized on this as a revelation of universal law. If the velocity of light is constant regardless of the earth\u2019s motion, he reasoned, it must be constant regardless of motion of any Sun, moon, star, meteor, or other syatem moving anywhere in universe. From this he drew a broader generalization, and asserted that the laws of nature are the same for alls uniformly moving system. This simple statement is the essence of Einstein\u2019s Special theory of Relativity. It incorporates the Galilean Relativity Principle which states that mechanical laws are the same for all uniformly moving systems. But its phrasing is more comprehensive; for Einstein was thinking not only of mechanical laws laws but of the laws governing light and other electromagnetic phenomena. So he lumped them together in one fundamental postulate: all the phenomena of nature, all the law of nature, are the same for all systems that move uniformly relative to one another\u201d (Universe and Dr.Einstein,Lincoln Barnett,London,1949, preface by Albert Einstein himself, page 38)Einstein\u2019s special theory of relativity states that the light velocity is the highest speed in this universe or nothing can travel faster than the speed of light. And the velocity of light is constant or light always travels at the same speed as \u2018a revelation of universal law\u2019. Unfortunately, a revelation of universal law is false.In this case Einstein ignored the refraction of light. Speed of light and other electromagnetic waves slow down by refraction when passing through the Earth\u2019s atmosphere.According to Stephen Hawking:\u201cThe theory also tells us that nothing can travel faster than light. The special theory of relativity was very successful in explaining that the speed of light appears the same to all observers (as shown by the Michelson-Morley experiment) and in describing what happens when things move at speeds close to the speed of light. However, it was inconsistent with the Newtonian theory of gravity, which said that objects attracted each other with a force that depended on the distance between them. This meant that if one moved one of the objects, the force on the other one would change instantaneously. Or in other gravitational effects should travel with infinite velocity, instead of at or below the speed of light, as the special theory of relativity required. Einstein made a number of unsuccessful attempts between 1908 and 1914 to find a theory of gravity that was consistent with special relativity. Finally, in 1915, he proposed what we now call the general theory of relativity. Einstein made the revolutionary suggestion that gravity is not a force like other forces, but is a consequence of the fact that space-time is not flat, as had been previously assumed: it is curved, or \u201cwarped,\u201d by the didistribution of mass and energy in it.\u201d(A Brief History of Time).Einstein\u2019s general relativity resolved conflicts between Newton theory of gravity and the special theory of relativity. But \u2026\u2026..make a big conflict with his special relativity itself about the existing of ether. In special relativity Einstein rejecting the ether theory: ether do not exist. In this theory Einstein believe in Michelson-Morley experiments.But in general relativity -1920 -Einstein accepting the ether theory, in other words Einstein didn\u2019t believe in Michelson-Morley experiments.In 1920 Einstein accepting the ether theoryAlbert Einstein said: \u201cRecapitulating, we may say that according to the general theory of relativity space is endowed with physical qualities; in this sense, therefore, there exists an ether. According to the general theory of relativity space without ether is unthinkable; for in such space there not only would be no propagation of light, but also no possibility of existence for standards of space and time \u2026\u201d(Albert Einstein gave an address on 5 May 1920 at the University of Leiden)In 1920 Einstein said about ether corresponding with classical ether. But in his paper in 1924, named \u201cConcerning the Aether\u201d, Einstein explained the \u201caether of general relativity\u201d is not absolute, because matter is influenced by the aether, just as matter influences the structure of the aether.So the only similarity of this relativistic aether concept with the classical aether models lies in the presence of physical properties in space. Therefore, Einstein\u2019s use of the word \u201caether\u201d found little support in the scientific community, and played no role in the continuing development of modern physics.References:1.Gatot Soedarto, The Evidence 2016,Amazon-CreateSpace, 2016.2.

Must ask: what is being offered, who is it being offered by, who is it being offered to? (E.g. IPO for shares = interest in a company, issued by that company). ICOs are more vague: not always issued by a company, not always a \u2018share\u2019, offered to people all over the world. The law depends on the framework of the token itself.Pip \u2014 Classifications: promise of why a person would take up an offer is central to why a person would participate in an ICO. When issuing, securities are done so that the investor expects to participate in a venture for which they will receive profit.Hannah \u2014 Yes, and you also know what you are participating in; you know their existing activities and they are held accountable. This is very different from a traditional securities environment.Pip \u2014 Invitation to treat/advertisement. The word invest is never used; rather, crowdfunding language is used. However, crowdfunding suggests the donation of money, for which the donor does not expect anything in return.Alex \u2014 In NZ, crowdfunding is the process of investing into a company \u2014 companies can only raise up to $2m in a 12 month period, which differs from normal securities.Hannah \u2014 Similar principles of general investing. If it\u2019s crowdfunding, you get equity, whereas this is not always the case in ICOs. If the rights look and act like a share, it could possibly be a share.Alex \u2014 Peter from Coin Center mentioned in the previous talk that ICOs are for financing open source movements and building infrastructure; this should not be treated the same as trying to raise funds for a company or private venture. This is a different beast from what we have had before. \u201cICO\u201d language needs to be changed.Pamela \u2014 People use the term ICO because they want the affiliation with an IPO; they are intentionally drawing those analogies to promote sales. E.g. Ethereum presale; talk of a crowdsale of a token, buying into the Ethereum system with an equity token. This changed very quickly, and the language was changed to a software presale rather than equity token. The marketing of the tokens (and how people view their use of the tokens) is very important for the legal perspective.Arthur \u2014 MasterCoin, BitShares and CounterParty were initial examples of ICOs.Hannah \u2014 It is difficult to figure out what is being offered.Pamela \u2014 Favourite ICO is ponzico.win \u2014 a parody ICO which is actually raising a decent amount of money.Hannah \u2014 If it looks too good to be true, it probably is.Pamela \u2014 You don\u2019t need to be an accredited investor for ICOs (although the barrier to entry is understanding of how to use crypto). Avoiding a regulatory barrier to entry makes them more convenient to buy into. Raises the question of why such regulatory barriers are there in the first place, and whether they should be revised given the latest technological architecture.Hannah \u2014 Shows a lack of capital in the market. Barrier to entry is being eroded, as some ICOs are now accepting fiat.Pip \u2014 In a normal online purchase, you don\u2019t have an expectation of profit on top of the value of the asset. However, in the case of ICOs, people are attracted by the potential for profiting from the token, and this is their expectation.Pamela \u2014 Secondary markets exist across the economy. E.g. Beanie babies \u2014 the secondary market was the catalyst for a lot of the purchases. The law is good when things are clear and consistent, but when people get involved, it starts to get messy.Alex \u2014 The existing laws are for a different age. If existing laws had applied to the internet, we wouldn\u2019t be having this conversation online right now. In Singapore and Switzerland, ICOs are being treated as assets. They are taking off in Europe, and the States might get left behind.Arthur \u2014 Regulatory arbitrage. Because this is an international market, creators and users are forced to use the jurisdiction that suits them the best, even when they are not geographically close.Pamela \u2014 Many companies are unable to set up in the States; from a business risk perspective, it makes more sense for them to incorporate outside the US, and stay away from US customers. Opportunity for other jurisdictions to create frameworks which work well.Hannah \u2014 Everyone can see the ICO, so the token is being offered to anyone/everyone. Therefore the jurisdiction of incorporation is not the only consideration; the jurisdiction of the purchasers will also be concerned.Pamela \u2014 Also, how do we deal with purchasers who buy a token in one country when they are a citizen of another? Can they take their tokens back to their home country if they are banned there?Pip \u2014 Completely novel question. Estonia allows registry as an e-citizen for anyone, and allows them to set up a business in Estonia; this could buy tokens. Could override geo-location by claiming that the jurisdiction of the purchaser (i.e. the business) is not the one where the person is.Pip \u2014 It is expensive for governments to investigate how we should create laws. Need the crowdfunding smart contract to include clauses on arbitration, remedies etc.Pamela \u2014 Has been advocating for the inclusion of robust arbitration clauses in ICOs. Even if they are not ready to include a smart contract element, they should do this to prevent some legal issues.Pip \u2014 Has been approached about a PhD exploring arbitration on the blockchain. Only heard of this being done in theory though. If entities are not ready to articulate smart-contract arbitration, they should not be setting up in the first place.Pamela \u2014 Interested in lawyers who are looking into arbitration in this industry. Another valuable resource is the American Arbitration Association\u2019s clause-builder; people could use this as a basic outline.Pip \u2014 Entities should work out the top 5 scenarios if disputes arise, and automate these. When it is automated, people could ratify the smart contract arbitration clause.Liesl \u2014 We have to consider that the code might not reflect the plain English clauses, so people will not necessarily get what they are expecting even when there is a clearly outlined, theoretically binding framework.Hannah \u2014 Code is black and white, but disputes have other circumstances. You can only code for the known unknowns, but there will be unforeseeable situations. We need to be careful that the code won\u2019t have unintended consequences.Pamela \u2014 There is no such thing as bug-free code, so there will always be some unintended outcome. Every time dispute resolution is encoded into a contract, this opens up more vulnerabilities, so we will need to find a balance. Some contracts might benefit from avoiding dispute resolution.Arthur \u2014 To assume that code can\u2019t be watertight is to relegate us to a prior time. In the future, we will possibly be able to get that right every time.Pamela \u2014 The whole point of this is that it\u2019s not a static system; it\u2019s fluid. Even the cryptography we have now will not last for long. So it\u2019s not about having bug-free code in a static environment, but about moving forward with the technical and software changes.Pip \u2014 Concern in insolvency scenario; there is powerful jurisdiction preventing insolvent trading, and with the automation of crowdfunding projects this cannot be applied as in existing markets. Third parties; who is the agent? Questions of fiduciary obligations and trusts. Can people be held liable for breach of fiduciary duties?Hannah \u2014 Comes back to relationship and promise; there is only a fiduciary relationship in certain circumstances. We need to look at who is involved, what their role is, and what is being promised.Pip \u2014 Many ICO entities hold the tokens on trust for the purchasers (e.g. on an exchange).Pamela \u2014 This is not an industry best-practice; the technology provides alternatives to that, and it is a huge red flag. The entire purpose of these platforms is that we don\u2019t need to trust third parties, so if they are holding others\u2019 assets, this becomes suspicious.Pip \u2014 We should direct listeners to the Howey test (to explain the conditions for securities).Alex \u2014 No one seems to be prosecuting yet. Better to beg for forgiveness than seek permission (i.e. start innovating now despite the unclear legal position).Liesl \u2014 It will be hard to ensure enforcement of existing or new laws relating to token launches, given the architecture of these technologies. Launches often have very different characteristics depending on the intent. There are also enforceability issues due to anonymity and dubious agency.Pip \u2014 Need information on the victims, and need to identify the perpetrators. We need confidence to develop to move into the next stage of these technologies.Next time: Review of Howey test. Why aren\u2019t regulators involved, and how should they do so? Terminology.

Aqu\u00ed, una gu\u00eda que explica qu\u00e9 es, para qu\u00e9 sirve y c\u00f3mo funciona\u2026Federico AstFollowJul 22, 2018 \u00b7 6 min readEste art\u00edculo es una versi\u00f3n traducida del original \u201cA Guide to Gas\u201d.Entre el 1 y el 3 de enero de 2018, el costo promedio de ejecutar una transacci\u00f3n en el blockchain de Ethereum creci\u00f3 187%. Esto se debe al aumento en el costo del \u201cgas\u201d, la unidad de medida utilizada para representar el costo de correr operaciones en Ethereum.El gas puede compararse con las comisiones de transacci\u00f3n que cobran las empresas de tarjetas de cr\u00e9dito. Pero los consumidores nunca interact\u00faan directamente con estos costos de transacci\u00f3n. Estos est\u00e1n ocultos dentro del precio del bien o servicio.En un blockchain no hay una entidad central que cobre comisiones, determine penalidades o que pueda bloquear transacciones de manera arbitraria, dejando a personas aisladas de la econom\u00eda. Sin embargo, esperar que cada usuario de Ethereum tenga que comprender el funcionamiento t\u00e9cnico del gas no es una experiencia de uso escalable.En el largo plazo, el ecosistema encontrar\u00e1 formas de simplificar el uso del gas para mejorar la experiencia del usuario y reducir el riesgo de transacciones anuladas. Mientras tanto, sin embargo, es importante comprender la utilidad del gas y la raz\u00f3n de su existencia.La M\u00e1quina Virtual de Ethereum y el GasLa M\u00e1quina Virtual de Ethereum (MVE) es el ambiente en el cual se ejecutan los smart contracts en el blockchain. Cada nodo de la red participa del blockchain de Ethereum. Entre todos, forman la MVE.Una transacci\u00f3n dentro de Ethereum se compone de una serie de operaciones secuenciales que ocurren dentro de la MVE. Cada operaci\u00f3n requiere de cierta cantidad de energ\u00eda de c\u00f3mputo para ejecutarse. Como los mineros deben utilizar energ\u00eda para completar esas operaciones, se cre\u00f3 una unidad de medida para monitorear este esfuerzo y compensarlos. Esta unidad se llama gas. El gas es la unidad que mide el trabajo computacional requerido para correr transacciones o smart contracts en la MVE. Mientras m\u00e1s energ\u00eda se necesite para correr una operaci\u00f3n (por ejemplo, porque su c\u00f3digo es m\u00e1s complejo) m\u00e1s gas se requiere. En s\u00ed mismo, el gas no tiene existencia. No existe algo como un \u201ctoken de gas\u201d. El valor de cada unidad de gas se expresa en ETH. Por ejemplo, una operaci\u00f3n podr\u00eda costar 3 gas, lo que ser\u00eda equivalente a 0.00004 ETH.Ahora bien: si el gas se mide en ETH, \u00bfpor qu\u00e9 no deshacerse de \u00e9l y expresar el costo de cada operaci\u00f3n directamente en ETH? El precio del ETH es altamente vol\u00e1til (entre el 1 y 3 de enero subi\u00f3 25%). Pero la energ\u00eda computacional requerida para realizar una transacci\u00f3n es constante. El costo de gas para realizar una \u201coperaci\u00f3n de suma\u201d en Ethereum era el mismo el 1 o 3 de enero, sin importar el valor del ETH.  El concepto de gas existe para distinguir entre el costo computacional de correr una operaci\u00f3n y el precio de mercado del ether. El costo de gas (la energ\u00eda requerida de una operaci\u00f3n) se mantiene constante m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de la volatilidad en el precio. Sin embargo, el precio de cada unidad de gas en ether cambia continuamente. Si el precio del ether sube significativamente, la red puede reducir cu\u00e1nto ether representa cada unidad de gas para mantener constante el costo para el usuario que paga por el gas.Los Componentes del GasEl gas tiene tres componentes fundamentales: costo del gas, precio del gas y l\u00edmite de gas. El costo de gas son las unidades de gas necesarias para correr cada operaci\u00f3n. Este costo est\u00e1 definido en los documentos t\u00e9cnicos de Ethereum. Por ejemplo, el costo de correr una \u201coperaci\u00f3n de suma\u201d es de 3 gas, y seguir\u00e1 siendo 3 gas sin importar cu\u00e1l sea el valor en d\u00f3lares del ether. La red no puede cambiar f\u00e1cilmente la cantidad de gas necesaria para correr una operaci\u00f3n. Pero el precio del gas expresado en ether s\u00ed puede ajustarse f\u00e1cilmente para responder a la volatilidad en el precio del ether o al tr\u00e1fico de la red. El precio del gas es el valor de una unidad de gas expresado en ether. El precio del gas se mide en Gwei. El Wei es la menor unidad de ether. Un Gwei es 1000 millones de Wei. En sitios como ethgasstation.info podemos ver el precio de gas promedio de la red. Los usuarios dispuestos a pagar un mayor precio de gas por su transacci\u00f3n ser\u00e1n priorizados por los mineros y la transacci\u00f3n se procesar\u00e1 m\u00e1s r\u00e1pidamente. Los mineros son quienes se quedan con el gas (o, m\u00e1s exactamente, con el ether que representa ese gas) que el usuario utiliza al enviar su transacci\u00f3n. Por lo tanto, los mineros priorizan las transacciones que tienen mayor precio de gas sobre las transacciones que tienen menor precio de gas. El l\u00edmite de gas es la m\u00e1xima cantidad de gas que uno est\u00e1 dispuesto a pagar en una transacci\u00f3n espec\u00edfica. El l\u00edmite de gas t\u00edpicamente es mayor que la cantidad real de gas que requiere la transacci\u00f3n. Si un usuario espec\u00edfica un l\u00edmite de gas demasiado bajo (las operaciones dentro de la transacci\u00f3n requieren m\u00e1s gas que el que el usuario asigna a la transacci\u00f3n), entonces un minero completar\u00e1 la transacci\u00f3n hasta que el gas se acabe. Cuando esto ocurra, la operaci\u00f3n fallar\u00e1 y el minero conservar\u00e1 las comisiones (ya que gast\u00f3 tiempo y energ\u00eda en ejecutar tantas operaciones como pudo). El blockchain guardar\u00e1 un registro de la operaci\u00f3n como \u201cfallida\u201d.Por Qu\u00e9 Existe el GasEl gas existe dentro del blockchain de Ethereum por tres motivos: financiero, te\u00f3rico y computacional. El motivo financiero es para incentivar a los mineros a invertir tiempo y energ\u00eda en ejecutar transacciones. Operaciones m\u00e1s complejas requieren m\u00e1s poder de c\u00f3mputo y, por lo tanto, m\u00e1s gas. Si un usuario desea que su transacci\u00f3n tenga prioridad, debe ofrecer un mayor precio de gas, para convencer a los mineros de procesarla antes. El motivo te\u00f3rico indica que el gas sirve para alinear los incentivos de los participantes de la red. Gran parte de la teor\u00eda del blockchain se ocupa de c\u00f3mo combatir a los agentes maliciosos en un ambiente donde no existe una autoridad central en la que confiar. El gas resuelve parcialmente este problema alineando los incentivos econ\u00f3micos entre usuarios. Los mineros tienen un incentivo para trabajar en la red. Los usuarios tienen un desincentivo a escribir c\u00f3digo pobre o malicioso porque est\u00e1n poniendo su ether (bajo la forma de gas) en juego. El motivo computacional detr\u00e1s del gas responde a un viejo problema de la teor\u00eda de computaci\u00f3n: el halting problem. El halting problem trata de determinar si un programa arbitrario parar\u00e1 de correr en alg\u00fan momento o correr\u00e1 por siempre, con s\u00f3lo observar su descripci\u00f3n y los valores de input. En 1936, Alan Turing determin\u00f3 que es imposible para una m\u00e1quina resolver el halting problem. En la MVE, esto significa que un minero nunca puede iniciar el procesamiento de una transacci\u00f3n teniendo una certeza total de que la transacci\u00f3n se detendr\u00e1 en alg\u00fan momento. Gracias al l\u00edmite de gas, cada transacci\u00f3n est\u00e1 asociada con una cantidad finita de gas. Incluso si un minero empieza a procesar una transacci\u00f3n que fue programada para seguir indefinidamente (debido a un bug o un ataque a la red), el gas eventualmente se acabar\u00e1, la transacci\u00f3n terminar\u00e1 y el minero ser\u00e1 compensado.Mirando el futuroPara los usuarios que reci\u00e9n empiezan a interactuar con el blockchain de Ethereum, el gas suele ser un concepto dif\u00edcil de entender. Si ponemos un precio de gas demasiado bajo, nuestra transacci\u00f3n no ser\u00e1 procesada. Si lo ponemos demasiado alto, estaremos pagando por dem\u00e1s. Si ponemos un l\u00edmite demasiado bajo, nuestra transacci\u00f3n fallar\u00e1 antes de finalizar (pero igualmente tendremos que pagar por ella). Colocar el peso de este conocimiento en el usuario no es un modelo escalable. En el futuro, el ecosistema encontrar\u00e1 formas m\u00e1s amigables en las que los usuarios no tendr\u00e1n que interactuar con el gas, del mismo modo en que los consumidores actualmente no interact\u00faan directamente con las comisiones de transacci\u00f3n. Un mejor manejo del gas ser\u00e1 importante para que el blockchain se acerque un paso m\u00e1s a la adopci\u00f3n masiva.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Blockchain", "Criptomonedas", "Ether", "Solidity"]}, {"title": "Buy Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin, Ripple, and EOS with Euro on Zebpay Exchange", "post_link": "https://blog.zebpay.com/buy-bitcoin-ether-litecoin-ripple-eos-and-tron-with-euro-on-zebpay-exchange-a7eaa14561ec?source=search_post", "author_name": "Zebpay", "author_link": "https://blog.zebpay.com/@zebpay", "publish_date": "2018-12-19", "last_modified_date": "2019-02-05", "readtime": "0.84", "claps": 8, "voters": 3, "content": "Buy Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin, Ripple, and EOS with Euro on Zebpay ExchangeZebpayFollowDec 19, 2018 \u00b7 1 min readIn a week\u2019s launch of Euro deposits/withdrawals support and BTC-EUR trading on Zebpay exchange, we are now adding 5 more cryptocurrencies to trade with Euro.Along with Bitcoin, you can now buy/sell Ether, Litecoin, Ripple, and EOS with Euro balance from your Zebpay account.Trade supported cryptocurrencies in Euro and crypto-to-crypto pairs at 0% maker fee and earn 0.25% more per transaction.Maker rewards valid till 31st Dec 2018.So, now trade more and earn more with Zebpay!Download Zebpay Crypto Exchange and Wallet now to start trading.

The rest of the post is mostly a conspiratory rant where you intentionally try to mischaracterize a network of multiple people and groups that work with each other and have common elements as a single unified group working behind the scenes to create the whole DAO conspiracy. This is a typical approach from anyone trying to build a conspiracy theory, try to prove single the existance of a larger unified cabal by proving individual connections.And it would be the lamest conspiracy ever: if anything most people I know on the EF would have preferred that the whole DAO debacle never happened in the first place, we spent a lot of time, the community split, a lot of people lost money, the market crashed and now we have all sorts os lunatics writing conspiracy posts about it. No one is better off for it.Now I agree that the Bity guys completelly screwed up when they sent it to an exchange. In my opinion they should have simply created a contract that had three options: donate the ether classic to the white hat hackers, get 90% and donate the rest and a \u201cI\u2019m an asshole and want it all\u201d button that would send 100% of the funds to an address of your choosing. This wouldn\u2019t require involving a legal entity like Bity and if cleverly done you could use the constant replayed transactions to ensure that someone could do it from Mist without even needing to sync a classic blockchain.I understand why they would rather go with an external entity like Bity, posts like yours prove that there are tons of people out there to get them, even though we all worked hard to help people their eth back, and these guys worked their asses to get some of the classic back.

So I\u2019m going to write this down and share it with all of you, once and for all. As a newbie, there are many options and funky different sites for getting started, so it can get confusing.So first of all understand that the first crypto-coin of interest was Bitcoin. So the first wave of sites allowing people to purchase crypto were focused on allowing people to purchase bitcoin in exchange for fiat. As I\u2019m in Australia, I like to use CoinJar for this.As bitcoin was establishing, we started to see a number of other cryptocurrencies emerge. To support these, we saw exchanges popup. These exchanges include Kraken, Poloniex, GDax, and the infamous (and now defunked) MtGox.So; if you wanted to be buy Ether (or another crypto-coin), the process would have been (and generally continues to be);Signup and verify your identity at CoinjarPurchase bitcoin from somewhere like CoinJarSignup and verify your identity at PoloniexSend your newly found bitcoin to an exchange like PoloniexBuy the crypto-coin of interest from Poloniex or exchange of your choiceTransfer your newly acquired coins to a wallet like JaxxWhat has made things interesting lately is that sites like Coinbase are starting to allow people to purchase Ether (Ethereum crypto-coin) directly with fiat. Coinbase has added Litecoin to this offering too, and there are rumours that others will follow suit, making it easier to purchase the popular altcoins like Ether directly.But, my general advice for anyone wanting to get in is to use the steps above. Buy your bitcoin from Coinjar, and sent it to Poloniex and buy your other altcoin of interest.Then hold, and be careful of your local tax laws when you sell.ICO\u2019s and token purchasing can be slightly different. I might write about that later.This is not investment advice.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Bitcoin", "Ethereum", "Altcoins"]}, {"title": "", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@TeriJo/and-again-im-wishing-somehow-someway-i-could-reach-thru-the-ether-and-just-hold-you-c2f1e0703db2?source=search_post", "author_name": "Terijo", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@TeriJo", "publish_date": "2016-10-25", "last_modified_date": "2016-10-25", "readtime": "0.23", "claps": 3, "voters": 3, "content": "And I\u2019m sorry that I can\u2019t.

Keeping this in mind, Unocoin has decided to add Ether(ETH) on its wallet where a user can buy and sell along with Bitcoin.Following features for Ether will be available on Unocoin:Buy ETHSell ETHDeposit ETHReceive ETHThere is no change in the process of buying and selling of Ether and it will remain the same as Bitcoin.Systematic Buying PlanSystematic Buying Plan (SBP) is one of the most popular features introduced by Unocoin for BTC where a user can invest his/her INR amount smartly and systematically with less risk on daily, weekly or monthly basis, when he/she is not sure about the right time to buy Bitcoin.The same applies for ETH also where Unocoin allows the user to set a fixed time or day of their choice when a certain amount decided by a user will be deducted automatically from his/her Unocoin account and put in the Ether SBP plan.Note: SBP plan for Ether will be rolled out soon.Assigning an ETH address to a UserOne important change a user must note is \u2014 How and when an ETH address is assigned to a user?Ether address is not assigned to a user by default unlike BTC address unless ETH address is already associated to him/her. ETH address will be assigned only when below actions are taken by a user on their Unocoin account:When users intentionally request Address AssignmentTradingUsers will be able to buy and sell their favorite \u201cEther\u201d right on the wallet, along with deposit and receive their holdings from and to the wallet.A user can buy minimum Ether worth Rs 982 and maximum buying limit Rs 20,00,000 has been set whereas minimum and maximum selling Ether price Rs 1,000 and Rs 20,00,000 has been set respectively.Referral Structure: Users will continue to operate in the usual referral structure where one can earn 15% of transaction fee on each successful transaction. The Referrer will receive the referral bonus in ETH form instead of BTC as the Buy/Sell has occurred for ETH (This referral structure is eligible only for existing BTC referrer).Fee StructureBuy and Sell Ether on Unocoin:Unocoin charges a fee of 0.7% to buy or sell Ether on its wallet. After a certain period of time and a considerable amount of transactions, users account will be upgraded to \u201cGold Membership\u201d where the transaction fee will be reduced to 0.5% of the trading amount and there will be no fee on holding of Ether on your Unocoin wallet.Sending and Receiving Ether on Unocoin:There is no fee when you send an Ether to an email id registered with Unocoin while sending ETH to another Ether address, Unocoin charges a fee of 0.01 ETH. There is no fee on receiving the Ether to your Unocoin wallet.Where Can You Get Started?Along with Bitcoin, now a user has the choice to buy and sell Ether in Unocoin wallet.

When I contacted the organiser if I can talk about the meetup, the organiser quickly responded saying there is one spot left.At this point, I actually did not have anything. I quickly created a meetup page, github repo, and gitter chat channel.During the meetup , I did a flash talk towards the end , asking how many people in the meetup have been coding with Ethereum. I think less than 30% of people raised hands. I also asked how many people have been coding for more than a year, which was a bit silly question because Ethereum itself has only been open to public for last several months, though handful of people raised hands.A handful of Ethereum experts who\u2019s been coding more than a yearIt seems like Ethereum is still a very young ecosystem so you are regarded as \u201cexpert\u201d even with 3 months of coding experience.I also mentioned that our study group is \u201cpaid event\u201d because of following reasons.We have limited space so I wanted to restrict to smaller number of motivated people who are willing to pay small amount (\u00a35)I am using the office of my employer(insurance company) as a venue, so it\u2019s easier to get cooperation/permission if this event is to help Whizz-Kids, a UK charity for disabled children which our company supports.I am currently fund raising for my 5 days sahara trekking challenge to support Whizz-Kids, and this will incentivise me to organise the meetup more regularly.I think I generally had positive responses and several people talked to me afterwords and actually signed up the event.On the day of the codeup, 7 people turned up. I think it\u2019s a pretty good size to start with. Here is the quick summary of the event.Everybody except I had environment setup on Ubuntu (even people with Mac). Apparently Ethereum tools are mainly developed in Ubuntu and cross compiled into other platform, so it is the most reliable environment.Most people started Ethereum before Homestead release. I had a feedback that it was interesting to see my video walkthrough posts because they haven\u2019t used the Ethereum Wallet yet.3 of the participants were actually writing Ethereum at work (including Proof Of Concepts), which is great.Steve and Francesco R mentioned that they use their own private test network using genesis blocks rather than using testnet.Andy from London Ethereum meetup helped some of us installing jaxx.io , Bitcoin and Ethereum Wallet. He also donated to the event in Ether!!Francesco C showed us one of his Hackathon projects InsurETH, which lets you insure your flight directly with an ethereum smart contract.Francesco C also showed us his own Blockchain App development micro-framework called bappTo be honest, I was the one of the newest among participants so I learnt a lot. Also we managed to raise close to \u00a390 for Whizz-kids which exceeded my expectation.I am hoping to organise this study group more regularly and the next one will be on 21st April.

So let\u2019s breakdown what Ethereum really is.Keeping it SimpleEthereum is a global computer, made of other computers. Simple as that. Now, let\u2019s attend to some questions that spring from this definition:Which computers make up Ethereum? Ethereum is made up of a network of Miners, or computers that confirm/organize transactions into Blocks onto Ethereum\u2019s Blockchain, and Full Nodes, or computers that aren\u2019t actively mining on Ethereum\u2019s network \u2014 but do transact ether (ETH) (and smart contracts) between each otherWhat is a Block? A \u201cblock\u201d is a group of confirmed transactions that occurred during a block-phase (or 1 \u201cblock\u201d of time, which, in Ethereum, is currently about every 15 seconds)What is a Blockchain? A \u201cblockchain\u201d is a chronological list of confirmed blocks (the oldest being the \u201cgenesis block\u201d\u2014 or first block)What is the difference between Ether and Ethereum? Ether is the digital currency of Ethereum. Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain network and global computer made up of computersA Few Features of EthereumYou can build applications on Ethereum\u2019s blockchain \u2014 they\u2019re called DApps, or Decentralized Applications \u2014 given that every full node on Ethereum\u2019s blockchain will download the smart contracts that power your DApp once it\u2019s executed on the blockchainIt\u2019s completely decentralized \u2014 all nodes know about all transactions that ever took placeTransactions have probabilistic finality \u2014 not complete finality like with fiat bank transactions.

FUEL is a transferable ERC-20 compliant digital token deployed on the Ethereum network.You wouldn\u2019t buy a house without researching the market and doing an inspection. You wouldn\u2019t buy stocks or securities without doing your homework and understanding the risks involved. And in the same way, you need to consider a few key points before diving head first into the world of cryptocurrency.Here are five things to ask yourself before your first crypto purchase.1. Why are you interested in cryptocurrency?You\u2019ve probably heard of Bitcoin or Ether and know that some people became millionaires seemingly overnight thanks to savvy early-stage purchases. While the crypto market is certainly growing and has proved lucrative to some, you shouldn\u2019t consider it your golden ticket to getting rich quick.Cryptocurrency is by nature a volatile and speculative investment based on supply and demand. And while higher-risk investments can generate high returns, you should only ever invest what you can afford to lose. Keep your expectations realistic, and like any investment, don\u2019t pour your life savings into one transaction.2. What are you going to own?It sounds obvious, but consider what you are actually buying. There are literally thousands of other types of Altcoins available today. And just as the British Pound is different to the American Dollar, the value and function of cryptocurrencies can differ.Whether you\u2019re interested in buying existing coin or supporting a new initial coin offering (ICO), do some research. For example, find out:What is the token supply currently in the market, or projected for release?Just as gold is a finite resource, cryptocurrencies are too limited by the overall supply of tokens a project or business decides to generate. Find out if it\u2019s stable or increasing in value.What will you get in return for your investment?Are you buying a coin or a token? Coins act as money, while tokens may act as an asset or utility that allow you access to a company\u2019s product or services.3. How will you store, buy and sell your cryptocurrency?You need a digital wallet to store your cryptocurrency and you need to join an exchange to buy or sell cryptocurrencies. Depending on the token and its popularity, you may need to sign-up at multiple exchanges in order to purchase a specific token as all cyptocurrencies are not listed on all exchanges.A digital wallet is essentially a secure type of software that acts like a storage facility for your cryptocurrency. The digital wallet will also hold the keys that enable you to buy and sell cryptocurrency online.Make sure you securely backup whatever type of digital wallet you choose and check whether you can store multiple types of cryptocurrencies on it.In addition, offline wallets exist, and are more secure than a hot wallet, or wallet that is connected online (i.e. a digital wallet).Offline wallets usually need a PIN or some sort of identifying information (like a passphrase) in order for you to access your wallet.Now that you have somewhere to store your cryptocurrency, how do you go about actually making a purchase?As mentioned, there are a number of active exchanges but if you don\u2019t already own any cryptocurrency, you\u2019ll need to join one that enables the transfer of government-backed currency (such as U.S. dollars) to cryptocurrency \u2014 which most do offer in 2018.Make sure you understand the fees and charges involved in the transaction.Once you\u2019ve made your purchase, you will then need to transfer your cryptocurrency from the exchange\u2019s wallet to your own personal wallet, digital, hardware or otherwise.Read article from Blockgeeks for more information on cryptocurrency wallets and the options available for crypto-holders today.4. What are the tax and legal implications?Different countries have different cryptocurrency regulations and this is an important point to remember. Japan, for example, is very progressive on crypto, it considers cryptocurrency legal tender and actively regulates the industry within its borders. In the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission has been focused on the use of blockchain assets as securities and has taken a much firmer but also more loosely defined approach.What does this mean for you?It means, again, you need to do your homework.Look at which exchange will accept currency from your country? Is the coin or token you purchase considered taxable income, an asset or a separate virtual currency?In the U.S., in terms of income tax, cryptocurrency is treated like an asset, like property or stocks. A recent IRS notice stated: \u201cGeneral tax principles that apply to property transactions apply to transactions using virtual currency \u2026 Taxpayers who do not properly report the income tax consequences of virtual currency transactions can be audited for those transactions and, when appropriate, can be liable for penalties and interest.\u201dThe bottom-line: Seek professional advice if you are unsure about the tax implications in your jurisdiction.5. Are you safe from scammers?Unfortunately, scammers are seemingly rife in the cryptocurrency world. When you are researching companies and the various types of cryptocurency, make sure to look at the company\u2019s website, as well third-party reviews or information in community forums such as Reddit and Telegram.Be extremely wary of social media and email communications asking you to send crypto or cash. If you participate in an initial coin offering, only use the specific address listed in the smart contract or reach out directly to the project or company to confirm the address to send payment to.Overall, the first step to owning cryptocurrency is to make sure you understand what you\u2019re buying, what the implications are in your country, and how you will securely buy and store your cryptocurrency. Conducting research before you get started will go a long way to making the process as seamless as possible.Visit etherparty.com for more information on Rocket and our other software products.

Additionally, there is a big focus on collaboration and exploration, allowing attendees to master their current skills and dive head-first into the world of exploring new subjects.Exopshere representative Moritz Bierling stated:\u201cExosphere Academy is the institution that prepares new generations to adapt and thrive in the new economy. We host immersive and interdisciplinary learning experiences. In the past 3 years we have run 7 long form programs, 2 summits, and 28 workshops (in 25 cities) for more than 1000 participants from 45 countries.\u201dAttending the Exosphere Academy 2016 is for everyone looking to play a role of importance in the Creative Economy over the next few years, as the current selection of \u201cstreams\u201d is focusing on coding, UI/UX development, entrepreneurship, and biohacking. There are limited spots available, and interested parties will need to fill in an application form first and foremost. Do keep in mind the Exosphere headquarters are located at Vina del Mar in Chile.As one would come to expect, this eight-week journey does not come free of charge, but this is where Exosphere shows its firm belief in the future of digital currency. By accepting Ether as a payment method, any Ethereum enthusiast can attend this educational program, assuming their application gets approved.Source: TwitterHeader image courtesy of ExosphereOriginally published at Fintechist.", "responses": 0, "tags": []}, {"title": "The Ether Review #39 \u2014 Zooko Wilcox, Zcash and Cryptography in the 1990s", "post_link": "https://etherreview.info/the-ether-review-39-zooko-wilcox-zcash-and-cryptography-in-the-1990s-a85f405c5db?source=search_post", "author_name": "Arthur Falls", "author_link": "https://etherreview.info/@arthurfalls", "publish_date": "2016-10-17", "last_modified_date": "2017-12-27", "readtime": "1.31", "claps": 3, "voters": 3, "content": "The Ether Review #39 \u2014 Zooko Wilcox, Zcash and Cryptography in the 1990sArthur FallsFollowOct 17, 2016 \u00b7 2 min readZooko Wilcox has more than 20 years of experience in open, decentralized systems, cryptography and information security, and startups.

Many of the individuals developing these tools have joined Zooko to form the Zcash company. Zcash aims to be a truly anonymous cryptocurrency, but more than just a currency, it is the first step toward managing privacy on public blockchains. Recently, at the Cornell University blockchain hackathon, Zcash team members participated in a successful effort to include an implementation of zero knowledge proofs known as ZKsnarks into an ethereum client running on a test net a monumental achievement in blockchain anonymity. In addition to this, the Zcash team are using the BTCRelay codebase to construct ZRelay, a bridge between the Zcash, Ethereum and Bitcoin blockchains.The final third of this episode is a casual discussion of the culture of the field of cryptography roughly between 1990 and 2000.ZcashChain analysis tools:Blockchain.infoOTX.melive.ether.campChain analysis services:EllipticChain AnalysisA very limited article on the history of cryptography but a conclusion worth skipping to.Great Forbes article on the dismay some mathematicians feel at the dominance of the NSA in their field of employment.The Cypherpunk FAQWikipedia links:Phil ZimmermanDavid ChaumContent: Zooko Wilcox, Arthur FallsSubscribe on iTunes & Soundcloud", "responses": 1, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Bitcoin", "Ethereum", "Podcast", "Zcash"]}, {"title": "#Ether 6: I don\u2019t understand automatic selling\u2026.", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@makoto_inoue/ether-6-i-don-t-understand-automatic-selling-b098eb24640e?source=search_post", "author_name": "makoto_inoue", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@makoto_inoue", "publish_date": "2016-03-29", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-11", "readtime": "0.73", "claps": 3, "voters": 3, "content": "#Ether 6: I don\u2019t understand automatic selling\u2026.makoto_inoueFollowMar 29, 2016 \u00b7 1 min readYou can understand some codes by reading them but sometimes you get proven wrong when you actually interact with them. \u201cautomatic-selling-and-buying\u201d tutorial of Ethereum is one of these things.

He practiced internal medicine and geriatrics for 30 years while teaching in a community hospital affiliated with the University of Kansas School of Medicine. He is board certified in internal medicine and geriatrics, and has been elected as Fellow of the American College of Physicians. Dr. Potter also holds a Ph.D. in religion, psychology, and ethics from the University of Chicago Divinity School. From 1994 until his retirement in 2004, he was the bioethics scholar, instructor, and consultant for the Center for Practical Bioethics in Kansas City, MO. From 2004 to 2014, he was Senior Scholar for the Center for Ethics in Healthcare at Oregon Health and Science University. Currently Dr. Potter is a scientific adviser for the American Association for the Advancement of Science\u2019s \u201cScience for Seminaries\u201d grant project at Multnomah Biblical Seminary.PLM: Dr. Potter, you have witnessed a great amount of change over your many years of service in medicine. You often quip that 90% of what you took to be fact back in medical school no longer stands as true. What are a few of the dramatic changes you have witnessed over the years?RLP: The main positive change in medical philosophy is an awareness of the need to approach the patient as a whole person, who exists in a matrix of relationships. At the same time, a negative counter current has developed that causes young professionals, especially, to interpret the patient through facts from the laboratory, X-ray, or other physical measurements; they examine the reports rather than the person. These two health-seeking strategies struggle with one another in today\u2019s practice climate.PLM: You have noted in course lectures on death and dying at Multnomah Biblical Seminary that you have observed a dramatic change in medicine, including palliative care, that reflects greater sensitivity to spiritual concerns. What are some examples? What are some published sources that you would encourage others to study in relation to this shift?RLP: Physicians and nurses are now more willing to ask patients about their spiritual lives. I think that is partly because the expected answers may be more in existential terms than religious terms. The shift to secular language that claims to be spiritual rather than religious is easier for the health-care provider to understand. I encourage your readers to follow thought leaders such as Daniel Sulmasy, M.D. at the University of Chicago Medical School, and Christina Puchalski, M.D. at George Washington University Medical School.PLM: You practiced traditional scientific medicine in various settings, and yet you also received a doctorate and taught in religion, psychology, and ethics. For some, your career might be viewed as a risk of floating in the ether [Note: Dr. Potter actually used this language when agreeing to do this interview with me!]. In a world where the New Atheist voices often appear loudest, you have argued in various secular and faith settings that we must seek to bridge the gap between faith and science, while safeguarding the integrity of the two domains. Why is this important? How do you personally go about bridging and safeguarding these domains?RLP: I was raised to be a Christian person who held fast to faith. I was also educated to be a scientist. It was my personal quest to bridge whatever gap I experienced between the two ways of experiencing the world. I found a deep level of integration of faith and science that allows me to experience my life as a meaningful whole. It is my conviction that a wholesome life is one lived in relation to God, who is experienced through all the other relationships within which I exist \u2014 my self with myself, others, and the created world. Through this matrix of energetic relationships, I am oriented to God and motivated by God to live fully engaged. This wholesomeness is real health and well-being.PLM: Do you have a final word for our readers?RLP: I recommend that the most direct way to get in touch with a science-filled faith is to study the wonder of the world. Diving deep into the complex beauty and awesomeness of nature has been a path to God\u2019s revelation for me. From microbiology to cosmology, the world wonders constantly amaze and lure me into a sense of gratitude for all that is.For more on Dr. Potter, here is an audio of a talk he gave at Multnomah University\u2019s Institute for Cultural Engagement: New Wine, New Wineskins\u2019 spring 2016 conference titled \u201cChurch and Science: Partners for the Common Good.\u201d The title of the talk is \u201cFaith and Health.\u201dImage courtesy of Elias Ehmann/Unsplash", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Healthcare", "Medicine", "Religion", "Wisdom", "Wonder"]}, {"title": "SEC official grants unofficial amnesty to Ether-the-asset, but not yet to Ethereum-the-ICO.", "post_link": "https://blog.reverse.vc/sec-official-grants-unofficial-amnesty-to-ether-the-asset-but-not-yet-to-ethereum-the-ico-d585e0767c7d?source=search_post", "author_name": "Zvi Avraham", "author_link": "https://blog.reverse.vc/@nivertech", "publish_date": "2018-06-14", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-14", "readtime": "0.48", "claps": 12, "voters": 3, "content": "SEC official grants unofficial amnesty to Ether-the-asset, but not yet to Ethereum-the-ICO.Zvi AvrahamFollowJun 14, 2018 \u00b7 1 min readApplying the disclosure regime of the federal securities laws to the offer and resale of Bitcoin would seem to add little value.[9] And putting aside the fundraising that accompanied the creation of Ether, based on my understanding of the present state of Ether, the Ethereum network and its decentralized structure, current offers and sales of Ether are not securities transactions.

So for $5,000 (though there\u2019s not actually any minimum) I was able to get exposure to several funds that would have otherwise have required $100,000 or more.But I also noticed they had Bitcoin listed as another optional alternative investment, with a suggested allocation of a bit less than 2% of my portfolio with them (I\u2019d deposited $20,000 into their standard product), or $358. That Bitcoin holding is now worth $1,335, for an increase (as of this writing) of 292% in about a year.I\u2019m not writing this to suggest that I\u2019m smart for putting money in Bitcoin (if I were that sort of smart, I would have put $100 into Bitcoin in 2010, and would now have more than $75 million, kinda like this guy\u2026)And I\u2019m certainly not writing this to suggest that you personally should invest money in Bitcoin or any other \u201ccryptocurrency\u201d (or related Initial Coin Offering). (Though I have also recently bought 3 units of \u201cEther\u201d, the value unit underlying Ethereum.)The reason I wanted to write something about Bitcoin and Ether as alternative investments is because they illustrate nicely one of the key principles of investing in alternatives, which is the difference between \u201cconcave\u201d and \u201cconvex\u201d risk (and reward).The key difference between concave and convex risk profiles is what happens as a result of unlikely and unexpected outlier events (ie, \u201cBlack Swans\u201d in Nassim Taleb\u2019s terminology \u2014 his 4-book-bundle is a masterpiece on understanding risk and randomness.)With concave risk, unlikely outlier events can only have negative effects. As an example, imagine that you notice a small leak in your home. The ensuing visit from the plumber may mean anything from a quick patch job to finding out you need a whole new roof. A \u201cgood\u201d outcome here is essentially defined as the \u201cleast bad\u201d \u2014 there\u2019s zero chance that the plumber is going to discover that your pipes are made of solid gold and your house is located atop an oil well.With convex risk, unlikely outliers can generate very large positive outcomes. As a timely example, JK Rowling\u2019s manuscript for the first Harry Potter book was rejected by 12 publishers before finally being accepted by Scholastic. Once she\u2019d written the book, the worst that could happen was more rejection, but as is now obvious, there was essentially no limit on the potential for the best-case scenario.So now let\u2019s bring things back to Bitcoin and Ether as alternative investments. They are related technologies, but there are important differences worth understanding:Bitcoin is a digital currency with no government or central bank issuing or backing it. Supply is limited, grows at a predefiend rate, and will never exceed 21 million bitcoins (BTC). Transactions are anonymous (which explains its appeal as the preferred payment choice for ransomware) and recorded using a distributed ledger called a blockchain. Its value is primarily a function of demand for it as a currency and value store.Ether is the \u201ctoken\u201d unit of a broader set of standards and technologies known as Ethereum. Ethereum also uses a distributed blockchain network, but is designed as a general purpose distributed computer, upon which any number of transactions, agreements, and applications like \u201csmart contracts\u201d can be run. Ethereum aspires to do for blockchain what the iPhone did for cell phones \u2014 move beyond a single application (eg, a phone) to a general-purpose computing platform (eg, the App Store on top of the internet and GPS). Ether (ETC) is used to \u201cfuel\u201d the Ethereum network (to use the network, you must pay fractional amounts of ETC into the system), and like Bitcoin, its supply is limited and capped, and its value is fundamentally a function of demand.(If you want more on Bitcoin, blockchain, and Ether, here\u2019s all of them explained quickly and concisely.)Both Bitcoin and Ethereum show signs of long-term adoption and usage (for example, Japan recently enacted legislation recognizing (and regulating) Bitcoin as a payment form, and Microsoft has begun offering \u201cBlockchain as a Service\u201d using Ethereum), but these are still very new and highly speculative technologies, and their related currency values can fluctuate immensely, as much as 20% \u2014 or more \u2014 in a day (or even within hours).Indeed, to get a sense of the underlying volatility involved with both Bitcoin and Ether as alternative investments, here\u2019s two screenshot from my Hedgeable dashboard comparing first the performance and then the relative risk metrics of the S&P 500 with Bitcoin over the same period:As with many investments, buying either Bitcoin and Ether as alternative investments today is a bet that someone else will pay a higher price at some point in the future, in part because you\u2019re betting that there will eventually be a much larger ecosystem of people and companies using them. Here\u2019s three of the main ways to invest in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and related \u201ccryptocurrencies\u201d:Short-term trading, where you buy and sell over hours, days, or perhaps weeks. This is actually trading, not investing.Investing in companies building applications or businesses around Ethereum or Bitcoin.Buying and holding BTC or ETC themselves, with the expectation that they will grow substantially in value over many months or years.While I\u2019m sure there are people making (and many more losing) money doing short-term trading, it\u2019s not for me. As for #2, the more I\u2019ve learned about Ethereum in particular, the more I think it\u2019s likely to be a very important technology platform for a range of interesting applications, especially B2B applications. I intend to keep learning more about the technology and ecosystem, and will definitely keep an eye out for interesting companies raising money in the space, but where I think things get most interesting is with #3 \u2014 though for very different reasons when it comes to Bitcoin and Ether as alternative investments respectively.Buying Bitcoin is a bet on demand for a currencyInitial demand for new (and especially anonymous) technologies is often proven out at the edges of the legitimate economy. I remember when in my suburban high school in the 90s \u201conly drug dealers have pagers or cell phones\u201d. But just because many of the early adopters were using them for nefarious reasons didn\u2019t mean there weren\u2019t plenty of legitimate uses out there for mobile communication devices. In hindsight, it\u2019s clear those uses were an early signal of massive latent demand.While a cynical read on Bitcoin is that companies will now be expected to keep some on hand in the event of another ransomware wave to avoid being gouged if demand spikes, another is that despite the growing pains, a legitimate and active market will develop for a highly liquid anonymous currency, and Bitcoin will be that currency.Buying Ether is a bet on an ecosystemWhen it comes to new technology standards and platforms, it\u2019s often clear fairly early on which standard or platform will dominate a space \u2014 for example, recall how quickly the open Web pushed aside walled-gardens like AOL and Prodigy. The challenge from an investment perspective is that it\u2019s incredibly difficult to predict which particular companies will succeed or fail within that platform (eg, Alta Vista vs. Google). So the interesting thing about Ethereum is that irrespective of which particular companies or applications ultimately succeed using the technology, all of them will need to use the underlying value token, Ether (ETC).In other words, buying ETC is a bet that there will be significant growth in demand for the overall system, each of whose participants will need to own ETC in order to use the system. But even if many of the companies and applications ultimately fail, as long as the underlying ecosystem succeeds, demand for ETC will grow along with it.So with ETC the bet is that a large and robust ecosystem of applications will develop, attracting even more companies and industries in the kind of virtuous cycle the drove the expansion of the Web (and famously, the fax machine quite a bit earlier).In either case, investing in Bitcoin and Ether as alternative investments isn\u2019t quite an \u201cinvestment\u201d in the sense most people think about it \u2014 of putting an amount in and expecting some specific range of return. Rather it\u2019s placing a few relatively small bets \u2014 small enough that if they don\u2019t work out, won\u2019t have a meaningful impact on your finances, but offer a small chance of significant upside. (As an extreme example, when you\u2019re a billionaire a few million dollars is a \u201csmall bet\u201d and some notable billionaires are placing them on Bitcoin and Ether.)If you\u2019re considering buying Bitcoin and Ether as alternative investments, you\u2019ll need an account with a company like Coinbase (even if you go through Hedgeable, they partner with Coinbase, so you\u2019ll need to create an account there too). While there are other exchanges and providers out there, Coinbase is established and reputable \u2014 no need to add any more risk to what\u2019s already likely to be a wild ride indeed.Originally published at yieldtalk.com on June 27, 2017.

This instance is exactly why I much prefer a decentralized organization like Dash and Bitcoin. When you have something this big centralized it leaves you more vulnerable to attack. I hope that everyone who has lost Ether during this hack can recover their funds.Look at this chart of Ether.The DAO Project Chart.The Post from Vitalik on the Ethereum Blog About the DAO Crisis.CRITICAL UPDATE Re: DAO VulnerabilityPosted by Vitalik Buterin on June 17th, 2016.An attack has been found and exploited in the DAO, and the attacker is currently in the process of draining the ether contained in the DAO into a child DAO. The attack is a recursive calling vulnerability, where an attacker called the \u201csplit\u201d function, and then calls the split function recursively inside of the split, thereby collecting ether many times over in a single transaction.The leaked ether is in a child DAO at https://etherchain.org/account/0x304a554a310c7e546dfe434669c62820b7d83490; even if no action is taken, the attacker will not be able to withdraw any ether at least for another ~27 days (the creation window for the child DAO). This is an issue that affects the DAO specifically; Ethereum itself is perfectly safe.The development community is proposing a soft fork, (with NO ROLLBACK; no transactions or blocks will be \u201creversed\u201d) which will make any transactions that make any calls/callcodes/delegatecalls that reduce the balance of an account with code hash 0x7278d050619a624f84f51987149ddb439cdaadfba5966f7cfaea7ad44340a4ba (ie. the DAO and children) lead to the transaction (not just the call, the transaction) being invalid, starting from block 1760000 (precise block number subject to change up until the point the code is released), preventing the ether from being withdrawn by the attacker past the 27-day window. This will later be followed up by a hard fork which will give token holders the ability to recover their ether.Miners and mining pools should resume allowing transactions as normal, wait for the soft fork code and stand ready to download and run it if they agree with this path forward for the Ethereum ecosystem. DAO token holders and ethereum users should sit tight and remain calm. Exchanges should feel safe in resuming trading ETH.Contract authors should take care to (1) be very careful about recursive call bugs, and listen to advice from the Ethereum contract programming community that will likely be forthcoming in the next week on mitigating such bugs, and (2) avoid creating contracts that contain more than ~$10m worth of value, with the exception of sub-token contracts and other systems whose value is itself defined by social consensus outside of the Ethereum platform, and which can be easily \u201chard forked\u201d via community consensus if a bug emerges (eg. MKR), at least until the community gains more experience with bug mitigation and/or better tools are developed.Developers, cryptographers and computer scientists should note that any high-level tools (including IDEs, formal verification, debuggers, symbolic execution) that make it easy to write safe smart contracts on Ethereum are prime candidates forDevGrants, Blockchain Labs grants and String\u2019s autonomous finance grants.The Original Post about the DAO Crisis by Vitalik Buterin on the Ethereum Blog.Read More by Randy Hilarski Here: DAO Crisis as The DAO Project Hacked and Ether Drained!via Randy Hilarski Dot Com \u2014 Feed http://www.randyhilarski.com/dao-crisis-ether/", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Panama", "Gold", "Silver", "Bitcoin", "Life"]}, {"title": "[Updated] Here\u2019s How to Buy Ether with USD (Even If You Live In New York)", "post_link": "https://medium.com/the-blockchain-consumer/updated-heres-how-to-buy-ether-with-usd-even-if-you-live-in-new-york-3f49af4b9f33?source=search_post", "author_name": "Chris Remus", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@cjremus", "publish_date": "2016-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2018-02-23", "readtime": "5.16", "claps": 1, "voters": 1, "content": "[Updated] Here\u2019s How to Buy Ether with USD (Even If You Live In New York)This post describes the steps I used to buy Ether in USD.

I\u2019m a bit confused because I wrote the original post after Shapeshift announced they were leaving New York.I\u2019m a curious person by nature and decided to look into this further. Less than 5 minutes of research revealed a solution. I\u2019ve updated this post to include the workaround. See step 3B for the update.Update #2 \u2014 Coinbase is now approved to trade Ether, even in New York State. Now anyone can establish an account on Coinbase and buy Ether with USD.I should say here that I wrote this article as an academic exploration of how to but Ether with USD. It\u2019s not intended, at all, to be an offer of investment advice, tax advice or anything else remotely related to using Ether as a financial vehicle.I\u2019m simply a blockchain enthusiast. I enjoy challenges and enjoy experimenting with new technologies. I only work with very small amounts of Bitcoin and Ether during my experiments.I live in Brooklyn, New York. A blockchain sticker on a mailbox in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, sparked my interest in blockchain. You can read more about how that happened here.This interest lead me to Ethereum and now Golem. I\u2019m planning to participate in Golem\u2019s crowdfunding process tomorrow. You can read more about how I plan to do that here.First I need Ether. This post describes the steps I used to buy Ether in USD. It\u2019s not a straightforward process right now.Living in New York makes it even more complicated. We have this thing called the Bitlicense here. It\u2019s meant to protect us from devious exchange operators. Apparently the Winkelvoss Twins aren\u2019t devious, since their exchange was the first to receive a Bitlicense. (It\u2019s true, you can look it up!)Oh well, moving on\u2026Disclaimer! This post is not intended to convince you to buy Ether with USD. It\u2019s simply to provide information, e.g. if you\u2019re interested in Ethereum and/or have already decided to buy Ether with USD. It is NOT a recommendation or offer of investment advice IN ANY WAY!The process took me about a month of on-again-off-again trial-and-error to figure out. It should take you about a week following these steps.Two factors contribute to the delay \u2014ID verification when you create an exchange accountPurchase account, i.e. credit card or bank account, verification in your exchange accountYou may not experience this delay if you live outside of New York. The exchange operators here have to comply with the Bitlicense, remember (SMH)?To be on the safe side, I\u2019d still suggest giving yourself a week to establish the process.How to Buy Ether in USDStep 1 \u2014 Create an Exchange AccountThe first step is to create an exchange account. You\u2019ll use this account to buy Bitcoin or Ether with a USD-denominated credit card or bank account.I did a lot of research and decided to use Coinbase. I didn\u2019t want to give my money to the Winkelvoss Twins. That ruled out their exchange.Coinbase was one of the small number of exchanges operating with a Bitlicense. Union Square Ventures has invested in Coinbase too. I admire Fred Wilson from Union Square Ventures. The fact he\u2019s trusting Coinbase made me comfortable doing the same.The initial ID verification process on Coinbase was frustrating. It seems to be fixed now.Step 2 \u2014 Add a Purchase Method to your Exchange AccountI chose to add a credit card to my account. I\u2019m still experimenting with Ether. This means I\u2019m buying very small amounts of Ether. Using a credit card felt like the easiest and safest way to do this.I wasn\u2019t comfortable linking a bank account to my Coinbase account. I figured if Coinbase ever got hacked, I\u2019d have the credit card fraud department to back me up on any fraudulent transactions. My bank would do the same, however I might be out the cash during the resolution period.Step 3 \u2014 Buy Ether Using your USD AccountIf you DON\u2019T live in New York, you can buy Ether on Coinbase using the account you added in Step 2. The Coinbase site makes it pretty easy.If you DO live in New York, you have to buy Bitcoin (NOT Ether) with the account you added in Step 2.Let me repeat this \u2014If you DO live in New York, you have to buy Bitcoin (NOT Ether) with the account you added in Step 2.The Coinbase UI/UX could use an update here. You can actually get to a point in the transaction where it looks like you can buy Ether with the account you added in Step 2.You\u2019ll add the USD amount, then the corresponding Ether amount WON\u2019T APPEAR.That\u2019s the only indication you\u2019ll receive the purchase of Ether won\u2019t work. I confirmed with Coinbase support that New York residents can only purchase Bitcoin.Congratulations if you don\u2019t live in New York, you\u2019re done!You now have Ether in your Coinbase wallet.(Note that some Ether transactions require you to use a wallet your control, rather than an exchange wallet, like Coinbase. If that\u2019s the case, you\u2019ll have to setup an Ether wallet.I\u2019ve tested the Ethereum Mist wallet, Parity and myetherwallet.myetherwallet is the way to go for me.It creates an Ether wallet for you in a single step. myetherwallet doesn\u2019t have to download the entire blockchain either. This will save you hours if not days, since downloading the entire blockchain takes that long.)Congratulations if you DO live in New York! We love it here for a lot of reasons, don\u2019t we? Ok, well the Bitlicense may not be one of them.Because of the Bitlicense, we have some more work to do here.[For New York Residents Only] Step 3A \u2014 Convert Bitcoin to to EtherMarch 2017 Update \u2014 The workaround mentioned above is to install a VPN on your computer. I like to use VPN\u2019s for many reasons.It turns out I had the Cloak VPN running on my laptop when I tried to access Shapeshift.io from New York. Magically, Shapeshift appeared, without the New York and North Korea notice :) I was able to exchange Bitcoin from my Coinbase wallet into Ether. The Ether was deposited into my Ether wallet.So install a VPN like Cloak, then follow the remaining steps.Use Shapeshift.io to convert your Bitcoin to Ether. To do this \u2014Setup your myetherwalletInitiate a Bitcoin to Ether transaction on Shapeshift.io, following Shapeshift\u2019s instructions. Do this by sending Bitcoin from your Coinbase Bitcoin wallet to the address Shapeshift.io generates for youConfirm receipt of your Ether in your myetherwalletOk, now you\u2019re done, even if you do live in New York! Go out and enjoy everything else New York has to offer :)P.S. If this post was helpful, please consider sending a small Ether contribution to me.

Pretty much the shopping list of features the Ethereum community is looking for.Yes, Yes, I know this is supposed to be a show about Ethereum, but examining emerging platforms is the best way to understand what the people with the deepest understanding would like to see changed in the protocol.Tezos is modular, designed to enable drop in replacement of most components without hard fork, it has a built in governance mechanism, and it uses a functional scripting language. These three elements are emerging as the most desirable traits missing from the Ethereum protocol. With EIP#86/EIP#96 Ethereum will move closer to what Tezos aspires to be.

The goal is to house it\u2019s many employees in a setting that makes use of it\u2019s technological portfolio.Andy Dan, Project Manager of Wanxiang Blockchain Labs joins to discuss what is quickly becoming the most epic of blockchain stories.Content: Andy Dan, Arthur FallsSubscribe on iTunes & Soundcloud", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Bitcoin", "Ethereum", "Podcast", "Venture Capital"]}, {"title": "Digital Asset Growth: Exploring bitcoin, Ether, and blockchains", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@adrian_jonklaas/digital-asset-growth-exploring-bitcoin-ether-and-blockchains-ae5d830ee4a4?source=search_post", "author_name": "Indra Adrian Jonklaas", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@adrian_jonklaas", "publish_date": "2017-02-24", "last_modified_date": "2018-04-19", "readtime": "8.38", "claps": 1, "voters": 1, "content": "Digital Asset Growth: Exploring bitcoin, Ether, and blockchainsIndra Adrian JonklaasFollowFeb 24, 2017 \u00b7 9 min readHello, World!Welcome to my first post on Medium.My name is Adrian Jonklaas, and I am an entrepreneur and angel investor based out of Vancouver, BC. This post is about a particular technology which also piqued my interest as a business and financial advisor.Question: what asset appreciated the most in 2016?The answer is not the Dow Jones, the S&P 500, emerging markets, gold, or any of the other traditional asset classes. It is the digital asset called bitcoin(which uses the three-letter identifier, \u201cBTC\u201d).Did you know bitcoin is classified as a commodity by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission? The following chart shows the performance of commodities in 2016.Source: https://www.fxstreet.com/analysis/bitcoin-performance-in-2016-201701031429For reference, the Dow Jones was up ~15% in 2016 and Russia\u2019s RTS index \u2014 the best-performing equity index globally \u2014 rose 52% in 2016.Around Christmas 2016, Boris Mann and I \u2014 who are doing a deep dive into blockchain technology as part of a broader exploration of frontier and emerging technologies that are going to shape industries and define businesses over the next ten years \u2014 discussed this incredible appreciation in bitcoin.We also came to the conclusion that this seemed like an ideal entry point into the Ether market. Ether (which uses the three-letter identifier, \u201cETH\u201d), like its big brother, bitcoin, is a digital asset. Both bitcoin and Ether are cryptographic tokens that \u201cfuel\u201d the Bitcoin and Ethereum platforms respectively.Given a number of initiatives slated for Ethereum in 2017 (Metropolis, Mist, Swarm, broader programming language development and support) Boris noted the network effects as adoption amongst developers of decentralized applications (\u201cdapps\u201d) on the Ethereum platform increased \u2014 hence boosting demand for ETH with end users, since ETH are required to run the dapps, and therefore conceivably increasing the value of ETH.\u201cWoah! What was that?!\u201d I hear some of you saying.Hang in there! I know I may have thrown out a lot of unfamiliar words and concepts in the preceding paragraphs. Just follow along as best you can, and I promise to explain everything, if not today, then over the next few posts. This is exactly why I am blogging about blockchain technology: so I can educate myself as I endeavour to break it down for you.So after my chat with Boris, I spent about 5 minutes looking into the onboarding process \u2014 answering for myself: how do I buy ETH?For a slightly neurotic person like me \u2014 especially when it comes to participating in something new \u2014 the onboarding process seemed intimidating or at least like something that would take an hour or more. I would have to research wallets (where to securely store bitcoins and Ether), download and potentially configure software, figure out how to transfer fiat currency to the wallet and/or an exchange; most of all, I would have to allay the (irrational?) fear that I would be turning money into electrons that would flit away down a wire, potentially forever lost.The last point, in particular, was not something I was ready to deal with. Believe it or not, it took me months before I made my first online purchase in the Year 2000.In any case, at the time, I was busy editing my Sci-Fi novella (\u201c2030 ET: Tribulation\u201d), so I gave buying ETH a pass thinking I would invest in ETH later in Q1 2017 when I had a bit more time to look into the technology and dispel any doubts I had.The chart below shows Ether price appreciation from Christmas 2016 through February 20, 2017.Ether Price Chart Dec 23, 2016 \u2014 Feb 20, 2017Source: https://www.coingecko.com/en/price_charts/ethereum/usd/60_daysNeedless to say, I am kicking myself for not making a significant investment into ETH over Christmas! Over this period, Ether rose from USD 7.50 per ETH to USD 12.75.\u201cSnooze, you lose.\u201dI missed a 70% bump over 2 months.For an angel investor, whose target (as determined by the average returns to angel investors in the seminal study by Rob Wiltbank and Warren Boeker) is 27% IRR over an average holding period of 3.5 years, that\u2019s a big miss.And guess what? It turns out, with just a credit card and an app \u2014 Coinbase \u2014 it is super simple to buy ETH, even without understanding anything about Ethereum or blockchain.What is blockchain?So what exactly are bitcoin and Ether? And why did they appreciate so significantly to make them the best performing (digital) assets? Are they money? A store of value? And /or do they have inherent utility in of themselves?This is the first of many blog posts on Bitcoin and Ethereum (the platforms that are \u201cfuelled\u201d by bitcoin and Ether respectively) and the underlying technology, blockchain, that both are built on. Over the course of the next few weeks and potentially months (blockchain is a huge topic; the rabbit hole runs deep!) I hope to research and answer the above questions as well as many more.To start with, for today\u2019s post, I endeavour to provide a simple answer to the question: What is blockchain?There are people far smarter than me who have written extensively on the topic. As such, at the end of this section I will point you to several resources I found useful in understanding blockchain which you can dig into.For now, here is a short summary in layman\u2019s terms:\u201cBlockchain is a decentralized database where blocks of data are chained together immutably.\u201dLet\u2019s parse the above.Blockchain is a decentralized database.Unlike data in a cloud, which is controlled (monitored/censored/etc.) by an entity (e.g. Amazon, Google, Microsoft, a Government), the data in the blockchain database is available to everybody. The fact that every single node \u2014 a software application running the blockchain, which can be downloaded and installed by anybody (for a public blockchain at least) \u2014 contains a full copy of the database prevents the most egregious misuses of data: censorship and falsification of data.Think about it: data cannot be censored if it is everywhere (no cloud servers to shut down). You can falsify the data within your database (and the ones you control); but nobody else will accept it as true if it does not match the data in the 1,000s of copies of the database outside your control.\u201cOld security models focus on locking people out. [Blockchain\u2019s] model focuses on letting everyone in.\u201dBlockchain is blocks of data.In the Bitcoin application of blockchain, each block stores a \u201cledger\u201d with changes in balances to bitcoin accounts (transactions).There is no (good) reason that the blocks could not store other data within; for example, you could record non-monetary transactions such as titles to land or even a record of weddings, births, and deaths.\u201cNamecoin,\u201d which was the first \u201cfork\u201d (copy and modification) of the Bitcoin blockchain, contains blocks which register and record ownership of .bit domain names creating the first censor proof DNS.Blocks in different implementations of blockchain can store other types of data e.g. blocks in the Ethereum implementation store either \u201cledger\u201d data or small computer programs (smart contracts) which run on an operating system called the Ethereum Virtual Machine.Each block also has information about itself in a header: how big is the block (in bytes), a hash (a cryptographic fingerprint) of all the data (transactions) in a block and a timestamp amongst other meta-data.There is one additional very important piece of information the block header contains: a unique identifier to the previous block (the hash of the previous block\u2019s header).Which leads us to\u2026Blockchain is blocks chained together.Imagine three blocks. Block 3 contains a hash of the header of Block 2 (a unique fingerprint that identifies Block 2). Block 2 contains a hash of the header of Block 1.If we change information contained in Block 1, for example, divert a transaction of bitcoins to an address we control, then the hash of the header of Block 1 would change (since the header itself contains a hash of the contents of the block).Note: with cryptographic hash functions, the change of a single bit of content creates a totally different fingerprint.That one change creates a cascade of changes. The hash of the header of Block 2 will change because it contains a hash of the header of Block 1. The hash of the header of Block 3 will also change because it contains the hash of the header of Block 2.Generalized, a change to the contents or header of any block changes all the blocks that come after it in the blockchain.Mind you, making changes to the content of a block is not easy since the block has to be cryptographically signed (with a hash). By design, it requires significant computing power to solve the cryptographic problem involved with the hashing. This process is called mining.Currently, it would take hundreds of years for a top-spec desktop PC and graphics card to mine a block. However, statistically, given all the computing power devoted to mining around the world, it takes on average 10 minutes to mine a block. Again, this is by design, with the difficulty of the cryptographic problem increased according to the hashing power added to the Bitcoin mining network.In practical terms, a mischief maker who wants to divert bitcoins to his own account, would be in a race to change all the three blocks and add a fourth block, Block 4, before other miners add Block 4 to the chain (an act which confirms the previous history of transactions contained in the chain).The longest chain rule is part of the consensus mechanism built into the Bitcoin blockchain where nodes are required to build on the longest chain and ignore shorter chains. The probability of mining all three blocks and adding a fourth before other miners add the fourth would be analogous to winning the Powerball lottery four times in a row, so is \u201czero\u201d for all intents and purposes, meaning it would be impossible for the mischief maker to win the race. The only possibility of abuse is if 51% of the miner network is controlled.To me, this is the first truly magical property of blockchain; its immutability.This linking of blocks goes back (in time) to the first block mined by Satoshi Nakamoto, the (anonymous) person who proposed and launched the first blockchain, Bitcoin.In my next post I will examine, the second magical property and key innovation of Satoshi Nakamoto, discussed in his (her?) famous 2008 whitepaper, which is the consensus mechanism that allows Bitcoin to function in a \u201ctrustless\u201d manner (where it doesn\u2019t matter what the intentions of the people who use the blockchain; they simply cannot steal or cheat without extreme effort).That discussion will be part of an examination of different types of blockchains (public and private) and applications of each.Now, here are the links I promised:A history of blockchain in the context of the evolution of centralized databases that blockchain is designed to replace; this explains the rationale as to why blockchain exists:https://media.consensys.net/programmable-blockchains-in-context-ethereum-s-future-cd8451eb421e#.7vc5dm5a2While \u201cgentle,\u201d this guide does go into more depth than my introduction to blockchain above:https://bitsonblocks.net/2015/09/09/a-gentle-introduction-to-blockchain-technology/This is an excellent video by Anders Brownworth that explains some of the key technical concepts of blockchain (hashes, blocks, blockchains, distributed peer-to-peer network): https://anders.com/blockchain/Eyeing the MarketsAs a CFA charterholder, I always have one eye on the markets. Markets post the global financial crisis of 2007\u20132008 have truly scared me because I have failed to understand them. So much fiat money has been (effectively) printed (in Western economies primarily) through quantitative easing; while the world has not seen price inflation in consumer goods the world has seen price inflation in financial assets (e.g. the second longest equity bull market in US history) in part fuelled by this loose monetary policy.Naturally, to see bitcoin and Ether as top performing assets intrigued me as a financial analyst. But more significantly, my deep dive into the underlying technology has opened my eyes to the potential of decentralized money; where its \u201csupply\u201d and \u201cworth\u201d are not controlled or influenced by central authorities.A final thought: bitcoin was v1 of a decentralized form of money and of blockchain; Ether is v2 (by virtue of introducing \u201csmart contracts\u201d to blockchain on top which decentralized applications can be built). Both are wonderful, and both have their flaws. In my next posts, I hope to shed some light on these topics including what I think is required of a v3 digital currency.Thanks for reading my first blog post on Medium.

These standards describe functions and events, such as transferring tokens or extracting data, that an Ethereum token contract has to implement in order to increase the interoperability within the Ethereum network.How to choose the right collateral amount?As a borrower, your main goal is to find a lender who is ready to fund your loan request. Choosing collaterals that do not cover at least 100% of the Ether requested, bears the risk for the lender of never getting Ether back and making a loss on the collaterals transferred. From the lender\u2019s perspective, you would probably never get the loan request funded, especially when you are new to the platform and have no accumulated CRE representing your credit score.Additionally, all tokens are subject to high volatility (risk through price fluctuations), which makes borrowed Ether, that is even fully covered by tokens collateral, a risky investment for the lender. So, to make the loan request much more attractive, a borrower should consider the future price fluctuations and put a certain mark-up (additional tokens) on the loan request.We worked on this problem and calculated for Golem the volatility for different lending periods.Let us go through some examples and show you how to choose the right amount of collaterals:Token: GolemLending Period: 1 monthTaking monthly returns for the last three months, we find that Golem (short: GNT) against Ethereum (short: ETH) is currently fluctuating around it\u2019s expected mean price by 36%, with the highest price increase of 130% and biggest drawdown (price decrease) of -37% in the same period.That means, in order to have an attractive loan request, the lender would have claimed 136% in GNT collaterals (100% to cover Ether + 36% securing against fluctuation in the case of a default).In current market terms (18. June 2017):1 ETH = 620 GNT (100%)= +237 GNT (36%) -> 857\u2013620 = 237= 857 GNT (136%) \u221a -> 620 * 1.36 = 857One could argue, that Golem\u2019s biggest price decrease in a day was -37% and that using this percentage would have been more secure. The higher the collaterals, the more security the lender has, which is correct. However, the drawdown of -37% is not representative since it relates to a single day. Those are outliers (exceptional price movements) and under current market conditions, the 36% mark-up would have been sufficient on most days, as it can be inferred from the volatility.Now, let us have a look on two more lending periods:Token: GolemLending Period: 1 weekNotice, that the volatility for weekly returns is decreased to 24%. One could infer, that the shorter the time period, the lower the observed price deviations and the less risk is involved. For this lending period, the borrower could provide a +24% mark-up on the GNT tokens.Token: GolemLending Period: 1 dayGiven a 1 day lending period, the risk in terms of volatility is decreased to 11%. Basically, on most days the 11% mark-up would have been sufficient to cover losses.Notice also, that the volatility for a lending period of one year is at least 206%!ConclusionFrom the numbers observed, we can see that the longer the lending period, the more collaterals should be provided due to higher risk (volatility). Also, the volatility differs not only for various lending periods, but also between different tokens. Currently, we work on a solution for providing a risk profile for any single tokens on the platform in real time.However, there is no guarantee that any of those numbers will give a 100% security in the case of a default. Sure, you will definitely receive the promised tokens since they are saved in the Smart Contract, but nobody is able to predict the price fluctuations of the tokens.The purpose of this article is to give the users of EthLend an idea of how to assess the amount of collaterals, in order to meet the needs of all parties involved.Author: @sergej.stein", "responses": 0, "tags": []}, {"title": "#Ether 4: Watch Token is quite handy", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@makoto_inoue/ether-4-watch-token-is-quite-handy-178c5cb65c9c?source=search_post", "author_name": "makoto_inoue", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@makoto_inoue", "publish_date": "2016-03-29", "last_modified_date": "2017-12-11", "readtime": "1.01", "claps": 1, "voters": 1, "content": "#Ether 4: Watch Token is quite handymakoto_inoueFollowMar 29, 2016 \u00b7 2 min readOne thing frustrates me when using Ethereum (even on testnet) is that it takes time for each contract or transaction to be confirmed.To ease the inconvinience, Ethereum Wallet has a feature called \u201cWatch Token\u201d, which is described as follows.To add a token to watch, go to the contracts page and then click \u201cWatch Token\u201d.

Back when setlists took a few days to get posted, and tapes showed up in the mail weeks after a show was played. Long before Live Phish, Phish from the Road and Instagram pics of set one, song two. It was when I still took setlists down by hand, and when Phish had new songs that pre-dated an album.I remember being at the soundcheck at Alpine in 1998, but this story really brings it back full circle after Sunday\u2019s show in Chicago. I knew I spent two whole years in graduate school studying my Phish tape collection, trying to make connections to larger media trends and socio-cultural phenomenon, but this random forum post says a lot more about fandom and live music that my graduate thesis ever could.\u2014-http://www.gadiel.com/phish/thoughts.htmlA Little Story From Alpine Valley, August 1st, 1998: I am pleased to say that I had a chance to be at Alpine Valley this summer, my third time in the past three years of great shows in East Troy. This year\u2019s show found itself a week earlier in August than the two previous highlight of tour shows, \u201896 & \u201897. Once again it was a highlight of the tour, a truly amazing show. I was far away from Phish and the tour for the entire summer, working at a summer camp as a counselor, given the opportunity to work with children, a job more rewarding than anything on earth. I was far removed, I had but my tape collection and discs, which can satisfy one\u2019s soul, but not nearly akin to a show, which fills one up to the breaking point time and again throughout the course of the night. My frined Dave Taus and I had been getting ready for Alpine the entire summer, from June 11th we would listen to tapes and talk in the ways only phisheads can understand. Then began the countdown as the end of July rolled around and August 1st came around. Phish was well into a tour that we had only seen through the computer, not doing the amazing shows justice. Phish truly seemed at their peak. It was an agonizing week. Finally the glorious day arrived and we found ourselves at the lot at Alpine Valley, only a few hours to go, FINALLY it was upon us. We decided to go for a walk, to puruse the vendors, maybe buy a shirt, some munchies or toss some disc. We found ourselves about two hundred feet from the entrance at about 2:30 in the afternoon and I thought I recognized the thundering bass that only belongs to Phish, I looked at Dave and he looked at me and we REALLY picked up the pace. We were right against the fence and I picked up Black-Eyed Katy, I hadn\u2019t known that they had reworked it and renamed it Moma Dance but the chorus soon gave it away. So Dave and I after a month and a half had stumbled upon Phish, soundchecking. What happened next is the stuff dreams are made of. I walked around the side to a delivery entrance and ran into a security guard and two phans on scaffolding listening as well, we talked and the guy showed me setlists from the tour and I was estatic to see what Phish was doing, the tour looked GOOD, and Alpine was shaping up to be a show!! I ran and got Dave so we could be closer to the soundcheck. They ended Moma Dance and Trey played the intro to Tela and stopped abruptly and it seemed that the band left the stage. The four of us, Dave, myself and our two new friends, whose names I never caught, were heartbroken, done already? We walked through a delivery door and ended up behind the beer gardens on a balcony overlooking the expansive lawn of Alpine Valley with the ski hills as a backdrop, a beautiful sight in the early summer afternoon. The four of us stood on the balcnoy watching the crew test lights, beer and food vendors set up shop, and we stared at the stage with a faint glimmer of hope that the band would retake the stage. Eventually Mike came on and strapped on his bass, then Page at the keyboards, and Trey on drums, oddly no Fish. They started a song that we identified as Albequrque, with the help of our tourhead friend. It was Trey and Page on vocals and they were having fun, especially Trey. Then Page left the stage and came back with his hands out, shaking his head and with a frustrated look on his face and from the mics we could pick up, \u201cI can\u2019t find him\u201d Obvioulsy Fish had taken off and found himself some beer and forgot to finish the soundcheck. He later returned with jeans and a t-shirt and sat at his kit. They began just playing, nothing distinct, just jamming it sounded alot like My Soul, in that fast bluesy sort of vein. After about ten minutes Trey started talking about cigars, making up a song and they jammed for about ten more minutes and he started up again and started talking about beer and how much it cost the night before and how it was more expensive here and how the song started out about cigars, then he started making fun of Fish and they jammed for about ten more minutes. They were having FUN!! Alpine was most defintely going to be a SHOW!!! They ended the Cigar/Beer jam (as I labled on my setlist) and then went into Albeqerque, this time with a full band. They close out the soundcheck with an energetic Ginseng Sullivan that had the four of us in the beer garden dancing. A great way to start a show! Close to two hours of Phish, before the show even started!! They had such a good time at the soundcheck and show itself that made it great to be back at show after such a long absence. Phish really is clicking on all cylinders and hopefully it won\u2019t stop for some time! I won\u2019t even mention how incredible the show was, hands down the best I\u2019ve seen. Phish really turns it up in East Troy. I\u2019m itching for the fall tour.

Let me preface this post by saying I have a tenuous grasp on the mechanics of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin etc. That being said I own a smattering of Bitcoin (less than $100). However that small amount of Bitcoin has helped me more about this space than the average non-participant.When describing this phenomenon I ask you to think back to the most recent edition of NCAA March Madness or the Super Bowl. Your $20 pool entry or $1 scoring square are by all accounts a rounding error in your net worth. Try to remember your emotions when your bracket got busted or the Falcons scored before the half ruining your chance at a tidy payday. Even these small stakes bring out our emotions and heighten our interest.Think about Samuel Lee of SVRN Asset Management who was profiled by Jason Zweig in the WSJ this past weekend. Lee made an early bet on the cryptocurrency Ethereum. This small intial bet, less than 5% of his portfolio, has surged along with the value of Ethereum. Lee has a better perspective than most on speculating in cryptocurrencies. Zweig writes:Putting only a tiny amount of his initial wealth at risk, and regarding the entire venture as an all but certain loss, have enabled Mr. Lee to keep greed from clouding his judgment \u2014 so far. \u201cI\u2019ve lost six figures in a matter of hours, several times,\u201d he says. \u201cI never lost sleep over it.\u201dSource: CoinbaseAnyone with even a limited amount of experience in the markets would look at the chart above and would think: BUBBLE.

After thinking about he recently wrote about Bitcoin:I no longer feel strongly that Bitcoin will cease to exist in three years, but I\u2019m also not sure if it\u2019s just a twenty-first century bubble either.As I noted earlier those people with their toes dipped in the cryptocurrency pool will have a front row seat for what happens next and will have the incentive to learn what is going on. Those sitting on the sidelines will be hamstrung by hindsight bias. The great thing is that in many of today\u2019s financial markets you no longer need much in the way of capital to get started. Howard Lindzon writes:Sometimes you just have to participate because just doing that puts you ahead of 99 percent of the people.To be clear I have no idea what will happen to the cryptocurrency universe. Like Michael Batnick it is increasingly more difficult to think the major alt-currencies will simply vanish but trying to put some sort of valuation on them is an exercise in futility. That being said my tiny fraction of a Bitcoin is going to keep me watching (and learning).For more information about the growing cryptocurrency phenomenon check out this podcast with Joe Weisenthal and Tracy Alloway of Bloomberg talking with Chris Burniske of Ark Invest.Disclaimer: Nothing on this site should ever be considered to be investment advice, research or an invitation to buy or sell any securities.

They had a project well before ICO mania came along and I know that some people in the industry whom I really respect, like Nick Tomaino, are big fans.I am still not totally sold on the concept, but that doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t play around with it, does it?Back in the very early days of my fascination with crypto, I remember one skeptic saying to me, \u201cwell, how does credit work with Bitcoin?\u201dI didn\u2019t have an answer then.He challenged me and said, \u201cwithout credit, the current capitalist economy would not exist.\u201dI was stumped.Well, the Collateralized Debt Position that MakerDAO offers is basically an answer to that.Simply put, you lend Ether to a smart contract as collateral and, in return for securing it there, you get DAI, the stablecoin that is algorithmically generated and maintained at a rate of 1 Dai = 1 USD.It gets a bit complicated as that ratio depends on the Ether price and I\u2019m not sure I can totally explain it just yet, but what\u2019s important is that you now have an asset (DAI) which is pegged at $1 USD.You can use that to buy other crypto assets and it\u2019s a loan secured by your collateralized Ether.But it\u2019s not a 1 to 1 ratio, you actually are getting crypto-leverage.What\u2019s cool about this, however, is that unlike in a \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d scenario, if the price of Ether falls below a certain point, you either have to pony up more to keep your position open or it is automatically liquidated, keeping the system in balance.Or \u201cstable\u201d I guess is a better termI have to admit that using this system (and I think their UX is great and they have a great explanatory video which I highly recommend, but it may take a few watches) has moved me more in the direction of believer.Over a year ago, I read their whitepaper 6\u20138 times and I just walked away feeling confused.Now, I see the potential. I\u2019ve actually created some crypto leverage which I can go out and use to invest or do whatever I want.The system is protected. It\u2019s all automated. No shady bankers hiding anything off the books.https://youtu.be/7f0ZMQCpov4", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Marketing", "Decentralized"]}, {"title": "Node Capital \u2014 Investing 200K Ether into US Crypto Startups!", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@saddington/node-capital-investing-200k-ether-into-us-crypto-startups-e76fd6e77b39?source=search_post", "author_name": "John Saddington", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@saddington", "publish_date": "2018-07-05", "last_modified_date": "2018-11-16", "readtime": "0.29", "claps": 15, "voters": 1, "content": "Node Capital \u2014 Investing 200K Ether into US Crypto Startups!John SaddingtonFollowJul 5, 2018 \u00b7 1 min readIt looks like someone had an idea about investing in crypto\u2026Originally published at DECENTRALIZED TV.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Bitcoin", "Cryptocurrency", "Node Capital", "Altcoins"]}, {"title": "Guru Rises From The Twitter #RIP Grave To ETHER DJ Premier", "post_link": "https://shabooty.com/guru-rises-from-the-twitter-rip-grave-to-ether-dj-premier-f4253ec42db4?source=search_post", "author_name": "Shabooty \u27bf", "author_link": "https://shabooty.com/@shabooty", "publish_date": "2010-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2017-12-24", "readtime": "0.92", "claps": 1, "voters": 1, "content": "Guru Rises From The Twitter #RIP Grave To ETHER DJ PremierShabooty \u27bfFollowMar 4, 2010 \u00b7 1 min readGuru Rises From The Twitter #RIP Grave To ETHER DJ PremierBlack People Twitter had pronounced Guru dead with an #RIPGURU trend the other day\u2026Well, not only is he not dead, and not in a coma, but he\u2019s alive and recovering, and doing well enough to take the time out to ether DJ Premier:\u201cI am doing fine and I am recovering!

Encouraged by its success and ability to match buyers and sellers at a single moment of the day, we launched an East Asian Timezone daily auction on March 21, 2017. We would now like to offer the same kind of price discovery we have facilitated for bitcoin traders over the past year for ether traders. As a result, we will be launching a daily 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time ether auction starting on Friday, July 28, 2017! The mechanics will be the same as our bitcoin auctions; please see https://gemini.com/marketplace/#auction for details.Daily auctions are universally implemented by traditional asset exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq, and Bats. They increase price discovery and transparency, and they reduce costs across the board by making sure that buyers and sellers don\u2019t miss each other during the trading day. In addition, we are confident that our Auction will bring you the benefits of over-the-counter (OTC) trading without the overhead, hassle, and lack of transparency.How Do Auctions Benefit Gemini Customers?Auctions aim to facilitate high volumes of trading between customers at a fair price by matching the maximum quantity to be bought and sold. Auctions provide the following benefits to our customers:Greater Price Discovery: Auctions focus market participants and economic information at a single moment in the day, resulting in better price discovery.Deeper Liquidity: Execute larger trades with less market price impact or \u201cslippage.\u201d Because Auctions are at a single moment in the day, more buyers and sellers are able to converge and provide more liquidity on both sides of the market.Mark-to-Market Benchmark Price: Auctions provide an official 4:00 p.m. ET end-of-day price for marking assets to market (e.g., for accounting purposes or for calculating returns).Instant Settlement: Auction trades settle immediately and funds are ready for immediate transfer (unlike OTC trades that can require phone calls, emails, specialized paperwork, risk during funds transfer, etc.).No Counterparty Risk: Auction trades settle immediately from pre-funded accounts, eliminating the risk that your counterparty will back out of a trade (unlike OTC trades which are typically not pre-funded).How Do Auctions Work?All eligible orders are filled at the final auction price. The final auction price of each Auction is determined by finding the price at which the greatest aggregate buy demand and aggregate sell demand from all participating orders can be filled (i.e., the price at which the largest quantity can trade). The mechanics of this auction are very similar to the closing auction (or \u201cclosing cross\u201d) on the major electronic U.S. stock exchanges (e.g., Nasdaq, NYSE Arca, Bats). For a more detailed discussion, please see our Marketplace page.How Can You Participate in Auctions?Easy! Customers can enter Auction-Only (AO) Market and Auction-Only (AO) Limit Orders to buy or to sell beginning well before the Auction time.Beginning 10 minutes before the Auction time, indicative auction prices are broadcast via both our market data API and our website frontend. A new indicative auction price is calculated every minute until the Auction time, based on the order book at that time, and every 15 seconds during the final minute. (These indicative prices are calculated by simulating the auction process for the order books if Auction were to occur at that time.)How to Buy or Sell Large Quantities in Gemini\u2019s Daily Auctions:Leading up to auction, liquidity providers place Auction-Only Orders on both the bid side and offer side of the market . These liquidity providers often compete for greater influence in the auction by tightening these spreads. That ultimately benefits all Auction participants.These liquidity providers also monitor the indicative auction prices. If they observe new liquidity demands in a particular Auction, they stand ready to modify their own Auction-Only Orders in order to facilitate liquidity demands. If you want to buy or sell a large quantity during one of the Auctions, we therefore recommend that you submit it approximately 10 minutes before the Auction time. This will give liquidity providers time to respond and to give your order access to increased liquidity.Questions?If you have any questions regarding Auction mechanics or the benefits that Auction may provide you, please check out our Marketplace page for a detailed description, or contact support@gemini.com.Onward and Upward,Team Gemini", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Fintech", "Cryptocurrency", "Bitcoin", "Announcements"]}, {"title": "ETHEREMON: \u0110\u1ea6U T\u01af TI\u1ec0N M\u00c3 HO\u00c1 TH\u00d4NG QUA GAME", "post_link": "https://medium.com/etheremon/etheremon-%C4%91%E1%BA%A7u-t%C6%B0-ti%E1%BB%81n-m%C3%A3-ho%C3%A1-th%C3%B4ng-qua-game-d97f1ae56bbc?source=search_post", "author_name": "Etheremon", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@myetheremon", "publish_date": "2018-05-03", "last_modified_date": "2018-05-03", "readtime": "5.30", "claps": 1, "voters": 1, "content": "ETHEREMON: \u0110\u1ea6U T\u01af TI\u1ec0N M\u00c3 HO\u00c1 TH\u00d4NG QUA GAMEEtheremonFollowMay 3, 2018 \u00b7 6 min readETHEREMON l\u00e0 t\u1ef1a game th\u1ebf gi\u1edbi \u1ea3o, t\u1ea1i \u0111\u00f3 t\u1ed3n t\u1ea1i nh\u1eefng Qu\u00e1i th\u00fa \u0111\u00e1ng y\u00eau Ether \u0111\u01b0\u1ee3c x\u00e2y d\u1ef1ng tr\u00ean m\u1ea1ng Ethereum.

Elle simule un monde de monstres d\u2019Ether (etheremons) o\u00f9 vous pouvez capturer, \u00e9changer et faire \u00e9voluer des etheremons pour vaincre vos adversaires.En tant qu\u2019application d\u00e9centralis\u00e9e, personne ne contr\u00f4le le monde d\u2019etheremon, et personne ne peut vous enlever votre etheremon ou vous arnaquer dans ce monde. Il est \u00e0 l\u2019abri de toute influence ext\u00e9rieure car il est garanti d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter seulement ce que les contrats intelligents d\u2019Etheremon ont \u00e9t\u00e9 programm\u00e9s \u00e0 faire (le code source est v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 et ouvert \u00e0 la vue de tous, rien n\u2019est dissimul\u00e9 dans ce monde). De plus, comme Ethereum fonctionne sur des milliers de machines simultan\u00e9ment, les services sont garantis \u00e0 100%.En outre, vous pouvez vendre et \u00e9changer votre etheremon comme n\u2019importe quel objet de collection traditionnel. Mais, contrairement aux objets de collection traditionnels, dans le monde d\u2019Etheremon, vous pouvez entra\u00eener votre etheremon, vaincre les autres et gagner des EMONTs (un jeton ERC-20).1. Concept de jeuLes \u00e9leveurs d\u2019etheremons (se r\u00e9f\u00e8re aux joueurs) interagissent avec les contrats intelligents sur le r\u00e9seau Ethereum pour atteindre trois objectifs:Capture des etheremons, monstres virtuels limit\u00e9s \u00e9mis sur le r\u00e9seau Ethereum, et compl\u00e9ter votre collection.Former des etheremons pour pondre des oeufs, les transformer en de nouvelles esp\u00e8ces \u00e0 vendre ou les pr\u00eater \u00e0 d\u2019autres \u00e9leveurs.Combattre avec d\u2019autres \u00e9leveurs d\u2019etheremons dans diff\u00e9rents modes de jeu (mode simple, mode groupe ou tournoi) pour collecter des EMONTs (un jeton ERC-20 en utilisant la monnaie du jeu).2. De quoi ai-je besoin pour jouer \u00e0 Etheremon?Pour interagir avec le monde Etheremon, les utilisateurs doivent effectuer des transactions Ethereum avec les contrats intelligents. Pour effectuer une transaction Ethereum, vous devez avoir:Un portefeuille Ethereum, vous pouvez en cr\u00e9er un nouveau sur le site Web MyEtherWallet et / ou en utilisant Metamask.L\u2019Ether, une forme de paiement num\u00e9rique pour r\u00e9gler vos transactions. Vous pouvez acheter de l\u2019Ether \u00e0 partir de n\u2019importe quelle plateforme d\u2019\u00e9change de crypto-monnaie disponible dans votre pays.Metamask ou Mist browser (optionnel), qui vous permet d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter des \u201capplications Ethereum\u201d (dApps) directement dans votre navigateur. Si vous ne souhaitez pas les utiliser, vous pouvez effectuer des transactions manuellement via le site Web MyEtherWallet.3. EMONTL\u2019EMONT est la monnaie du jeu d\u2019Etheremon. \u00c9tant un jeton ERC20, il est transf\u00e9rable et limit\u00e9. Il n\u2019y a que 20 millions d\u2019EMONTs cr\u00e9\u00e9s, et ils sont distribu\u00e9s ainsi :70% ou 14 millions : qui doivent \u00eatre \u201cmin\u00e9s\u201d par les joueurs pendant les op\u00e9rations dans le jeu comme les combats. Apr\u00e8s l\u2019extraction de tous les jetons, le jeu sera autonome et fonctionnera enti\u00e8rement avec des jetons EMONTs (aucun Ether n\u2019est n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0).25% ou 5 millions : r\u00e9serv\u00e9 \u00e0 notre \u201cpool\u201d de croissance des utilisateurs.5% ou 1 million : r\u00e9serv\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quipe de d\u00e9veloppement.4. Les diff\u00e9rences esp\u00e8ces d\u2019etheremons4.1 Attributs des etheremonsLes \u00e9leveurs d\u2019etheremons commencent le jeu en attrapant des etheremons. Si les esp\u00e8ces d\u2019etheremons sont attrapables (ne sont pas extinctes), les \u00e9leveurs d\u2019etheremons peuvent les attraper directement sur notre site en payant des jetons EMONTs ou de l\u2019Ether. Sinon, les \u00e9leveurs d\u2019etheremons doivent les acheter sur le march\u00e9.Les nouvelles esp\u00e8ces d\u2019Etheremon sont introduites par l\u2019\u00e9quipe d\u2019Etheremon, et elles ne seront capturables que pendant une p\u00e9riode limit\u00e9e. Ensuite, les \u00e9leveurs d\u2019etheremons ne pourront plus acheter ces etheremons que sur le march\u00e9. Le nombre de ces etheremons ne pourra \u00eatre augment\u00e9 que par des etheremons pondant des oeufs.Puissance de combat ou \u201cBattle Power\u201d (BP)Chaque Etheremon que vous attrapez a un \u201cBattle Power\u201d. Le Battle Power est une valeur unique et simplifi\u00e9e qui encapsule les six statistiques de combat d\u2019un Etheremon: ses points de vie ou \u201cHealth Point\u201d (HP), son attaque principale ou \u201cPrimary Attack\u201d(PA), son attaque secondaire ou \u201cSecondary Attack\u201d (SA), sa d\u00e9fense primaire ou \u201cPrimary Defense\u201d (PD), sa d\u00e9fense secondaire ou \u201cSecondary Attack\u201d (SD) et sa vitesse ou \u201cSpeed\u201d (SP).L\u2019exp\u00e9rience (EXP) ne peut \u00eatre acquise qu\u2019en combattant; plus l\u2019EXP est \u00e9lev\u00e9e, plus l\u2019etheremon a un niveau \u00e9lev\u00e9. Les etheremons de haut niveau ont des statistiques plus \u00e9lev\u00e9es et sont donc plus forts. De plus, apr\u00e8s avoir atteint un certain niveau, certains Etheremons auront la capacit\u00e9 de se transformer.Les types :Chaque etheremon a de 1 \u00e0 3 types. Il y a 17 types : insecte, dragon, mystique, feu, fant\u00f4me, terre, neutre, t\u00e9l\u00e9pathe, fer, foudre, combat, volant, feuille, toxine, roche, eau, glace. Chaque type a un avantage sur un autre type. Le diagramme ci-dessous refl\u00e8te les relations entre chaques types:Les anc\u00eatres :Chaque etheremon a de 1 \u00e0 3 anc\u00eatres (except\u00e9 la g\u00e9n\u00e9ration dite z\u00e9ro \u201cGen-0\u201d d\u2019etheremons).Un anc\u00eatre augmente les statistiques offensives de son descendant dans la bataille. Par exemple, Cobrus a Mizumi, Chulember et Vivorin comme ses anc\u00eatres, donc si Cobrus rejoint la bataille avec ces Etheremons, sa puissance d\u2019attaque est augment\u00e9e.Les \u00e9leveurs d\u2019etheremons ne peuvent transformer un etheremon que s\u2019il poss\u00e8de tous ses anc\u00eatres.G\u00e9n\u00e9rationsChaque esp\u00e8ce d\u2019etheremon appartient \u00e0 une g\u00e9n\u00e9ration. La g\u00e9n\u00e9ration est d\u00e9finie selon les r\u00e8gles suivantes:Gen-0 (aussi connu comme la g\u00e9n\u00e9ration l\u00e9gendaire \u201cLegend\u201d): c\u2019est la g\u00e9n\u00e9ration sp\u00e9ciale. Ils n\u2019ont aucun anc\u00eatre et ils ne peuvent pas pondre. Ils sont plus attrapables, donc le nombre de monstres de Gen-0 est limit\u00e9 et vous ne pouvez en avoir qu\u2019un via le march\u00e9.Gen-x: un Etheremon est de gen-x si la g\u00e9n\u00e9ration la plus ancienne de ses anc\u00eatres est de x-1. Par exemple, Pudde a Eakape, Vermillios et Mirrie comme ses anc\u00eatres. Eakape est de gen-0, Vermillios est de gen-0 et Mirrie est de gen-1. Par cons\u00e9quent, Pudde est de gen-2GasonIl y a une classe sp\u00e9ciale appel\u00e9e \u201cGason\u201d. Quand un Gason est dans votre groupe, il augmente les stats d\u00e9fensives de tous les Etheremon du m\u00eame type. Les Gasons n\u2019ont pas d\u2019anc\u00eatres, seulement une seule forme, et ne peuvent pas pondre d\u2019oeufs. Ce type d\u2019Etheremon pourra toujours \u00eatre attrap\u00e9 dans le magasin.4.2 Ponte d\u2019oeufs d\u2019EtheremonsCertains Etheremon peuvent pondre des \u0153ufs \u00e0 un certain niveau (\u00e0 l\u2019exception des Gasons et des l\u00e9gendaires).Le niveau de ponte pour chaque type d\u2019Etheremon est diff\u00e9rent. par exemple, un Cobrus peut pondre des \u0153ufs au niveau 30, tandis qu\u2019un Pudde pourra pondre des \u0153ufs au niveau 28.Apr\u00e8s la ponte, le niveau de l\u2019Etheremon sera r\u00e9duit d\u2019un certain montant. Par exemple, apr\u00e8s qu\u2019un Cobrus ait pondu un \u0153uf, son niveau sera r\u00e9duit \u00e0 27.Un oeuf doit \u00eatre \u00e9clo pour devenir un Etheremon. Un entra\u00eeneur ne peut \u00e9clore qu\u2019un oeuf \u00e0 la fois. Le moment de l\u2019\u00e9closion d\u2019un \u0153uf est al\u00e9atoire, de quelques heures \u00e0 quelques jours.4.3 Transformation des EtheremonsCertains Etheremon peuvent se transformer \u00e0 un certain niveau.Apr\u00e8s la transformation, le niveau de l\u2019Etheremon sera r\u00e9initialis\u00e9 \u00e0 1 et toutes ses caract\u00e9ristiques (HP, PA, PD, SA, SD, SP) seront consid\u00e9rablement augment\u00e9es par rapport \u00e0 son \u00e9quivalent non transform\u00e9 de niveau 1.Pour transformer un Etheremon, les entra\u00eeneurs doivent rassembler tous leurs anc\u00eatres.Apr\u00e8s la transformation, certains Etheremon peuvent pondre des \u0153ufs de sa forme transform\u00e9e actuelle apr\u00e8s avoir atteint un certain niveau. Ce niveau sera sup\u00e9rieur \u00e0 celui de sa forme pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente. Par exemple, apr\u00e8s avoir transform\u00e9 un Cobrus en Dracobra, vous devrez entra\u00eener ce Dracobra du niveau 1 au niveau 40. \u00c0 ce niveau, Dracobra peut pondre des \u0153ufs et ces oeufs \u00e9closeront pour donner un nouveau Dracobra.5. R\u00e8gles du jeu de batailleLe mode bataille est l\u2019un des aspects les plus importants et passionnants du monde Etheremon. Il y a quelques modes de combat en cours de d\u00e9veloppement. Trois d\u2019entre eux sont d\u00e9j\u00e0 sortis: le Mode Ch\u00e2teau, le Mode Gym et le Mode Entra\u00eenement.5.1 Mode ch\u00e2teauDans le monde d\u2019Etheremon, il y a des endroits sp\u00e9ciaux appel\u00e9s collines o\u00f9 vous pouvez construire et d\u00e9fendre votre propre ch\u00e2teau. Un total de 30 collines ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9couvertes dans le monde. Depuis leur d\u00e9couverte, les MonSeekers se battent sans arr\u00eat pour revendiquer les collines et entra\u00eener leur Etheremon.Construire et d\u00e9fendre un ch\u00e2teauSur une colline vide, vous pouvez construire un ch\u00e2teau en engageant une \u00e9quipe de construction de Blockids au prix d\u2019au moins 0,02 Ether ou 15 EMONTs pour 5 briques.Pour chaque bataille perdue, le ch\u00e2teau est endommag\u00e9 et perd 1 brique. Pour chaque bataille gagn\u00e9e, le propri\u00e9taire du ch\u00e2teau est r\u00e9compens\u00e9 d\u20191 EMONT. Cependant, le nombre d\u2019EMONT re\u00e7u ne peut pas \u00eatre sup\u00e9rieur au nombre de briques.Pour chaque 8 batailles gagn\u00e9es, le ch\u00e2teau re\u00e7oit une brique d\u2019honneur suppl\u00e9mentaire de l\u2019\u00e9quipe des constructeurs Blockid. Cependant, le nombre total de briques d\u2019honneur ne peut pas \u00eatre sup\u00e9rieur au nombre de briques.Une fois que le nombre de briques tombe \u00e0 0, le ch\u00e2teau tombe et est d\u00e9truit.Vous pouvez renforcer votre ch\u00e2teau en le construisant avec plus de briques (1 brique suppl\u00e9mentaire = 0.004 eth ou 3 EMONTS).Pour d\u00e9fendre votre ch\u00e2teau, vous formez une \u00e9quipe de 3 combattants avec jusqu\u2019\u00e0 3 autres etheremons appel\u00e9s supporteurs. Les supporteurs doivent \u00eatre des gazons ou des anc\u00eatres des combattants utilis\u00e9s pour augmenter les statistiques d\u00e9fensives et offensives.Attaquer un ch\u00e2teauVous pouvez tenter de d\u00e9truire un ch\u00e2teau en lan\u00e7ant des attaques pour r\u00e9duire ses briques. Votre \u00e9quipe attaquante comprendra \u00e9galement 3 combattants et jusqu\u2019\u00e0 3 supporteurs. Chaque fois que vous r\u00e9ussissez une attaque sur un ch\u00e2teau, vous serez r\u00e9compens\u00e9 d\u20191 EMONT. Vous ne pouvez pas attaquer les ch\u00e2teaux dont le niveau moyen est beaucoup plus bas que le niveau moyen de vos combattants.Le jeu principalDans une bataille d\u2019etheremons, chaque \u00e9quipe comprendra 3 combattants et jusqu\u2019\u00e0 3 supporteurs. Les combattants se battront respectivement en fonction de leurs positions: premier vs premier, deuxi\u00e8me vs deuxi\u00e8me, troisi\u00e8me et troisi\u00e8me. Dans chaque match, une s\u00e9rie de combats individuels entre les membres des \u00e9quipes adverses sont automatiquement simul\u00e9s dans notre contrat intelligent selon les r\u00e8gles suivantes:L\u2019etheremon se pr\u00e9sente pour attaquer. Celui avec la plus grande vitesse attaque en premier.La D\u00e9fense Primaire r\u00e9duit les d\u00e9g\u00e2ts de l\u2019Attaque Primaire entrante, la D\u00e9fense Secondaire r\u00e9duit les d\u00e9g\u00e2ts de l\u2019Attaque Secondaire entrante.Pendant un tour, quelle que soit l\u2019attaque (Attaque primaire ou secondaire) qui occasionne le plus de d\u00e9g\u00e2ts au d\u00e9fenseur, elle sera effectu\u00e9e par le combattant, ce qui r\u00e9duira les PV du d\u00e9fenseur.A chaque attaque, le combattant peut d\u00e9crocher une \u201cattaque critique\u201d. Cela signifie que son attaque primaire / secondaire sera beaucoup plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e que la normale. Les attaques critiques sont d\u00e9clench\u00e9es de mani\u00e8re al\u00e9atoire.Le premier etheremon \u00e0 perdre tous ses points de vie perd le combat.L\u2019etheremon gagnant est r\u00e9compens\u00e9 par une grande quantit\u00e9 d\u2019exp\u00e9rience tandis que l\u2019etheremon perdant gagne de l\u2019exp\u00e9rience d\u2019un montant moindre.Les combattants restants continueront la bataille.Il y a un total de 3 rencontres, et l\u2019\u00e9quipe qui triomphe en 2 matchs ou plus gagne la bataille globale.SupporteursChaque \u00e9quipe comprend jusqu\u2019\u00e0 3 supporteurs. Ils peuvent \u00eatre des anc\u00eatres combattants ou des gazons.Un anc\u00eatre supporteur augmente toutes les statistiques offensives de son descendant de 10% (par exemple: attaque primaire et attaque secondaire augment\u00e9e de 10%). Cet effet se r\u00e9p\u00e8te s\u2019il existe plusieurs anc\u00eatres. Par exemple, s\u2019il y a 2 anc\u00eatres de l\u2019etheremon attaquant pr\u00e9sent, l\u2019attaque primaire et secondaire est augment\u00e9e de 20%.Un gazon de soutien augmente toutes les caract\u00e9ristiques d\u00e9fensives de son type de 10% (par exemple: d\u00e9fense primaire et d\u00e9fense secondaire a augment\u00e9 de 10%).Par exemple: Pudde est dans l\u2019\u00e9quipe de combat et les partisans sont Mushmite, Vermillios et Mirrie. Les statistiques offensives de Pudde sont augment\u00e9es de 20% et les statistiques d\u00e9fensives de 10%.Notes: les anc\u00eatres multiples du m\u00eame genre ou plusieurs gazons des m\u00eames types sont compt\u00e9s comme un seul. Par exemple, si vous mettez trois Polynimos en tant que supporterus, tous les combattants avec le type de feu re\u00e7oivent une augmentation de 10% des statistiques d\u00e9fensives (au lieu de 30%).Les typesQuand un Etheremon est en train de combattre un autre Etheremon dont il a l\u2019avantage, ses statistiques offensives sont augment\u00e9es de 20%.EXP GainLe gain d\u2019exp\u00e9rience est calcul\u00e9 dans chaque match bas\u00e9 principalement sur le niveau de l\u2019Etheremon adverse. Plus le niveau de l\u2019adversaire est \u00e9lev\u00e9, plus votre Etheremon peut gagner en exp\u00e9rience. Par exemple, un Etheremon de niveau 1 a besoin d\u2019environ 3.22 victoires contre d\u2019autres level-1 pour monter de niveau. Un Etheremon de niveau 10 a besoin de 5,8 victoires contre les autres 10, mais 15,6 victoires contre les niveaux 5 ou 42,4 contre les niveaux 1.Une d\u00e9faite donne \u00e9galement droit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quivalent de 1/3 du montant d\u2019exp\u00e9rience d\u2019une victoire.5.2 Mode GymLe mode Gym sert de pont vers le mode ch\u00e2teau, ce qui permet aux etheremons nouvellement captur\u00e9s de s\u2019entra\u00eener efficacement tout en abaissant la barri\u00e8re d\u2019entr\u00e9e pour les nouveaux joueurs.Les r\u00e8gles du mode Gym sont simples:Il y a 9 etheremons (les entra\u00eeneurs) non-joueurs dans le gymnase.Pour commencer l\u2019entra\u00eenement, s\u00e9lectionnez l\u2019un de vos Etheremon (la recrue), 3 entra\u00eeneurs et leur niveau (de 1 \u00e0 5).Le stagiaire combattra l\u2019entra\u00eeneur un par un pour un total de 3 rencontres.Les r\u00e8gles de Matchup sont les m\u00eames qu\u2019en mode Ch\u00e2teau, sauf que sans gazons ni anc\u00eatres. L\u2019exp\u00e9rience acquise est d\u2019environ 70% de celle du mode ch\u00e2teau.5.3 Mode de pratiqueLe mode Entra\u00eenement permet aux joueurs d\u2019attaquer des ch\u00e2teaux lorsque les prix du gas sont tr\u00e8s \u00e9lev\u00e9s et que le co\u00fbt de la bataille devient trop \u00e9lev\u00e9.En payant des frais de 0.005 ETH (le prix peut \u00eatre sujet \u00e0 changement), vous pouvez parvenir \u00e0 r\u00e9duire consid\u00e9rablement vos d\u00e9penses en gas.Le mode Bataille n\u00e9cessite une limite de 900 000 weis de gas et vous permet d\u2019attaquer un seul ch\u00e2teau. Le mode Entra\u00eenement vous permet de combattre cinq ch\u00e2teaux simultan\u00e9ment tout en gardant votre limite de gas inf\u00e9rieure ou \u00e9gale \u00e0 300 000 weis.Pour le propri\u00e9taire du ch\u00e2teau en d\u00e9fense, le mode Entra\u00eenement augmente l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e9conomique de poss\u00e9der des ch\u00e2teaux. En mode combat, les propri\u00e9taires de ch\u00e2teaux sont r\u00e9compens\u00e9s principalement par l\u2019EXP passive. Les attaquants pourraient abuser de leur choix de ch\u00e2teaux et les d\u00e9truire rapidement pour obtenir la r\u00e9compense du gagnant d\u20191 EMONT.Le mode entra\u00eenement supprime cet inconv\u00e9nient du d\u00e9fenseur. La durabilit\u00e9 d\u2019un ch\u00e2teau ne diminue pas apr\u00e8s une d\u00e9fense rat\u00e9e. Une d\u00e9fense r\u00e9ussie offre au propri\u00e9taire du ch\u00e2teau 0.25 EMONT quel que soit le r\u00e9sultat.Techniquement, votre ch\u00e2teau peut maintenant rester en place pour un nombre illimit\u00e9 d\u2019attaques et continuer \u00e0 vous r\u00e9compenser en EMONTs.Cependant, les propri\u00e9taires de ch\u00e2teaux ne gagnent aucune EXP pour \u00eatre attaqu\u00e9s dans ce mode. Si vous voulez acc\u00e9l\u00e9rer EXP rapidement, vous devez toujours vous d\u00e9fendre en mode Battle ou attaquer en mode Entra\u00eenement.Le mode entra\u00eenement est tr\u00e8s similaire au mode combat. Une diff\u00e9rence cl\u00e9 est que vous attaquez 5 ch\u00e2teaux diff\u00e9rents \u00e0 la fois avec votre \u00e9quipe.S\u00e9lectionnez votre combattant et supporteur.S\u00e9lectionnez le ch\u00e2teau que vous aimeriez affronter.Une fois que vous avez termin\u00e9 les pr\u00e9paratifs, appuyez sur le bouton \u00abD\u00e9marrer l\u2019entra\u00eenement\u00bb et finalisez la transaction.6. Feuille de routeLe projet Etheremon est divis\u00e9 en trois phases principales:Phase 1: [publi\u00e9]Toutes les fonctionnalit\u00e9s fondamentales du jeu sont impl\u00e9ment\u00e9es et publi\u00e9es avec succ\u00e8s sur le r\u00e9seau principal Ethereum. Les MonSeekers peuvent attraper un Etheremon, l\u2019entra\u00eener \u00e0 pondre des \u0153ufs, le transformer en une nouvelle esp\u00e8ce ou vaincre les autres pour gagner des EMONTs. Le march\u00e9 est \u00e9galement ouvert aux MonSeekers pour acheter, vendre, pr\u00eater et emprunter leurs etheremons.Les deux premiers modes de combat, le ch\u00e2teau et la Gym, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s aux MonSeekers. Des milliers de batailles ont eu lieu en quelques semaines, rendant Etheremon pr\u00eat \u00e0 \u00eatre le jeu de crypto le plus populaire de 2018!Phase 2: [en cours de d\u00e9veloppement]Dans cette phrase, nous allons nous concentrer sur le d\u00e9veloppement de nouveaux modes de jeu:Mode de jeu P2P: Les MonSeekers peuvent combattre 1 contre 1 en envoyant une lettre de d\u00e9fi.Ligues et tournois: Des milliers de MonSeekers peuvent jouer ensemble et s\u2019affronter pour gagner des prix pr\u00e9cieux.Mode aventure: explorez le monde virtuel et recherchez de nouveaux etheremons.La technologie VR sera appliqu\u00e9e pour apporter aux utilisateurs la meilleure exp\u00e9rience de jeu. Voir les nouvelles sur le partenariat d\u2019Etheremon avec Decentraland.De plus, une solution de mise \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9chelle hors cha\u00eene sera introduite pour r\u00e9soudre le probl\u00e8me de l\u2019\u00e9volutivit\u00e9.Phase 3: [en cours de d\u00e9veloppement]Dans la phase 3, nous allons nous concentrer sur la construction de l\u2019Alliance EMON. En fournissant des SDK faciles \u00e0 utiliser et en partageant notre exp\u00e9rience sur le d\u00e9veloppement de jeux crypto, nous voulons connecter et encourager d\u2019autres d\u00e9veloppeurs de jeux \u00e0 impl\u00e9menter leurs propres jeux de cryptographie ou fournir un nouveau mode de combat pour Etheremon.\u2014 \u2014 \u2014Suivez nous sur :Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/etheremon/Twitter: https://twitter.com/myetheremonReddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/etheremon/Discord: https://discord.gg/xgJpuzcTelegram: https://t.me/myetheremonEmail: contact@etheremon.com", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Etheremon", "Blockchain", "Bitcoin", "Ethereum", "French"]}, {"title": "UPDATE #2: Ether Classic Withdrawals", "post_link": "https://medium.com/gemini/update-2-ether-classic-withdrawals-ebf3b083003e?source=search_post", "author_name": "Cameron Winklevoss", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@winklevoss", "publish_date": "2016-08-12", "last_modified_date": "2018-05-14", "readtime": "0.84", "claps": 4, "voters": 1, "content": "UPDATE #2: Ether Classic WithdrawalsCameron WinklevossFollowAug 12, 2016 \u00b7 1 min readEther Classic withdrawals are now availableTwo weeks ago we made an announcement regarding our ongoing work to allow withdrawal of ETC (Ether Classic or ETHC) for customers who had ether balances at the time of the \u201cHard Fork,\u201d as well as customers who have deposited ETC into their Gemini accounts since the \u201cHard Fork.\u201dWe are pleased to announce that as of Friday, August 12, 2016, Gemini will allow all customers with ETC balances to withdraw their assets.

There is a debate around whether the flexibility of the imperative paradigm of programming language design or the verifiability of the functional paradigm are more appropriate for the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Martin is in the functional camp which he believes can make Ethereum a more robust and powerful platform. The EVM itself is often overlooked as a black box, but is one of a tripartite of technologies including the consensus mechanism and the distributed ledger, whose design is interdependent. Exploring the relationship between these components is an interesting way to gain a deeper understanding of everyone\u2019s favorite world computer.Content: Martin Lundfall, Arthur FallsSubscribe on iTunes or Soundcloud", "responses": 0, "tags": ["The Ether Review Podcast", "Ethereum", "Solidity", "Blockchain", "Functional Programming"]}, {"title": "The Ether Review #43 \u2014 BHP, Tracking the Most Valuable Rock on Earth", "post_link": "https://media.consensys.net/the-ether-review-43-bhp-tracking-the-most-valuable-rock-on-earth-a6208d7b564?source=search_post", "author_name": "ConsenSys", "author_link": "https://media.consensys.net/@ConsenSys", "publish_date": "2016-09-30", "last_modified_date": "2017-12-10", "readtime": "0.39", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "The Ether Review #43 \u2014 BHP, Tracking the Most Valuable Rock on EarthConsenSysFollowSep 30, 2016 \u00b7 1 min readCore samples from oil wells can be worth more than gold.

This energy in those metals moved to paper, which was valued because it was IOU\u2019s (debts) for metal. While the IOU\u2019s were cancelled in the 20th century, some paper retained its energy since people were still willing to work for it. It is difficult to take energy out of money, but it is easy to trade that energy for other objects, or in order to get work done.Regarding your claim that money is not energy because it requires humans to harness:Harnessing the energy in gasoline requires an engine. Harnessing the energy in an apple requires a digestive system. Harnessing photons requires chlorophyll. Fortunately, engines, digestive systems, and chlorophyll each exist.Just because harnessing the energy in money requires humans does not negate the truth: money can do work, so money has energy.Regarding your claim that energy in fiat currencies would mean energy could be created:When a new $100 bill is printed, the increased supply of dollars devalues all other dollars. As explained in the original article, a fraction of energy of each existing dollar moves into new dollars. Energy is not created.(Some people deny that inflation is theft because it has many victims who suffer just barely, whereas most thefts have one victim who suffers greatly. Other people deny money is energy because it depends on the force of people, rather than chemistry or physics.)Regarding your claim that bitcoin\u2019s proof-of-work would only be work if it were done on a Babbage Difference Engine:Just as work is required to move a mass across a gravitational field, work is required to move electrons across a charged field. Modern CPU\u2019s are not mechanical, but they do work. Experts estimate that 10% to 20% of the energy consumed by modern CPU\u2019s goes to computational work, with 80% to 90% going to heat. Modern computers may seem like magic, but at their heart, they are still machines.p.s. A common refrain in your writing is that bitcoin is not money.

Since my post, white people (and in this case, a Russian person) have been displacing their anger towards me, instead of on the KILLER!None of that is blog-worthy however, but this message right here DESERVES A RESPONSE. It was obvious in my post I didn\u2019t know the girl, so if anything I said (I honestly didn\u2019t say much other than she was in fact cute, and it was a shame she got killed). Then, I made a generalization that a lot of cute chicks, don\u2019t really have the sense, god gave geese. Which is a joke. It\u2019s more of an inside joke, and an homage to my favorite blogger, Byron Crawford. Regular readers know what\u2019s up.Anyways, then comes along this Russian chick Regina Sorina, that WENT IN ON ME! She is a friend of a friend. I had met her once, not by choice. She just happened to be at the sports bar we were at. Here\u2019s her message, and here is my RESPONSE below it! Note: if the shit she talked about me was true, I probably wouldn\u2019t be highlighting it in it\u2019s own post, here.Okay, first sentence: I am the most disrespectful person she\u2019s ever known. The one time I met her I was polite. Next.Again, this chick is a friend of a friend. That\u2019s it. My humor is not NONSENSE, it\u2019s called COMEDY, but COMEDY TO someone DEVOID OF A SENSE OF HUMOR = NONSENSE.Let me make an interjection as well, this whole thing was a tragedy. When people make jokes in the light of tragedy, it\u2019s just how they deal with a tragedy. Ask any psychologist, making jokes amid tragedy, is just a form of expression and coping with the situation. ANYWAYS.According to her 1st hand account of Shabooty, in person, I am the most QUIET, awkward little boy she\u2019s ever met. (I am 6'1\" by the way, lol.) But there was a reason for that so called awkwardness\u2026 it\u2019s called that chick having the MOST DOUCHEY, HOVERING, INSECURE BOYFRIEND I HAVE EVER MET. As an aside, I met \u201cRegina\u201d while at a bar to see my friend and to watch the REDSKINS playoff game. Last time I checked, you don\u2019t have much convo during a Redskins vs Cowboys playoff game in standing room only. But more to the point, I have never in my life, been confronted by a girl\u2019s boyfriend like that. You know, the kind of guy that buddy-buddy\u2019s up to you. But not in a really him trying to be your real friend kind of way, but rather in a, him being insecure you\u2019re gonna steal his girl kind of way.Side note: the friend I have in common with Regina told me that the relationship with her boyfriend was a bit rocky, and they had recently just got back together. I was cognizant of that, so I was understood the guy\u2019s EXTRA insecurity, and I was actually really cordial and nice to him and stayed away from his girl \u2014 AS A FAVOR TO HIM. But I\u2019ve never had a dude like that come up to me like, \u201cyo doggg\u2026 I work at so and so (some kind of party service), if you ever need to rent foosball tables for a party, let me know and I can hook you up!\u201d \u201cGive me your number man, where do you usually hang out? We should hang out sometime.\u201d I am a good judge of character and that guy was just a DOUCHE. The two douchey love birds have found each other \u2014 OH JOY!So her boyfriend was buddying up to me, and I felt awkward, \u2019cause their relationship was just on the rocks and now I got this dude bugging me, being my fake friend, when he just f*cking met me, watching my every move around his girl. I don\u2019t warm up to random GUYS like that, I am sorry. Being my friend is a privilege. AND OF COURSE I\u2019M GONNA BE QUIET around YOU \u201cREGINA\u201d, when your douchey boyfriend is there, HOVERING AROUND ME\u2026 what the fu*k! Let\u2019s get the facts straight. Again, I don\u2019t have conversations with chicks WITH their boyfriend. That\u2019s just a waste of breath.You can say what you want about my confidence, but I will just say, anything I do on or offline is LOST on someone like Regina that lacks any recognizable sense of humor. You can be Chris Rock, but if a chick has her head up her ass, they\u2019re just gonna see a short lil black guy, that\u2019s awkward. Everybody Hates Chris, eh? And just an FYI: my collective of friends are all comedic minds.So, let\u2019s get back to the whole reason this started and thank you my dear friend Regina Sorina for proving my point\u2026 CHICKS DON\u2019T HAVE THE SENSE GOD GAVE GEESE!!!![Joke]Now, I can only hope I can convince a 17 year old (almost half my age), to come over and help me deal with my post traumatic stress disorder that this backlash has given me, #SARCASM.

It\u2019s been in the news a lot lately, including the cover of some major magazines, but reading those articles can be like gibberish if you don\u2019t have a foundation for what exactly Ethereum is. So what is it? In essence, a public database that keeps a permanent record of digital transactions. Importantly, this database doesn\u2019t require any central authority to maintain and secure it. Instead it operates as a \u201ctrustless\u201d transactional system \u2014 a framework in which individuals can make peer-to-peer transactions without needing to trust a third party OR one another.Still confused? That\u2019s where this post comes in. My aim is to explain how Ethereum functions at a technical level, without complex math or scary-looking formulas. Even if you\u2019re not a programmer, I hope you\u2019ll walk away with at least better grasp of the tech. If some parts are too technical and difficult to grok, that\u2019s totally fine! There\u2019s really no need to understand every little detail. I recommend just focusing on understanding things at a broad level. Many of the topics covered in this post are a breakdown of the concepts discussed in the yellow paper. I\u2019ve added my own explanations and diagrams to make understanding Ethereum easier. Those brave enough to take on the technical challenge can also read the Ethereum yellow paper.Let\u2019s get started!Blockchain definitionA blockchain is a \u201ccryptographically secure transactional singleton machine with shared-state.\u201d [1] That\u2019s a mouthful, isn\u2019t it? Let\u2019s break it down.\u201cCryptographically secure\u201d means that the creation of digital currency is secured by complex mathematical algorithms that are obscenely hard to break. Think of a firewall of sorts. They make it nearly impossible to cheat the system (e.g. create fake transactions, erase transactions, etc.)\u201cTransactional singleton machine\u201d means that there\u2019s a single canonical instance of the machine responsible for all the transactions being created in the system. In other words, there\u2019s a single global truth that everyone believes in.\u201cWith shared-state\u201d means that the state stored on this machine is shared and open to everyone.Ethereum implements this blockchain paradigm.The Ethereum blockchain paradigm explainedThe Ethereum blockchain is essentially a transaction-based state machine. In computer science, a state machine refers to something that will read a series of inputs and, based on those inputs, will transition to a new state.With Ethereum\u2019s state machine, we begin with a \u201cgenesis state.\u201d This is analogous to a blank slate, before any transactions have happened on the network. When transactions are executed, this genesis state transitions into some final state. At any point in time, this final state represents the current state of Ethereum.The state of Ethereum has millions of transactions. These transactions are grouped into \u201cblocks.\u201d A block contains a series of transactions, and each block is chained together with its previous block.To cause a transition from one state to the next, a transaction must be valid. For a transaction to be considered valid, it must go through a validation process known as mining. Mining is when a group of nodes (i.e. computers) expend their compute resources to create a block of valid transactions.Any node on the network that declares itself as a miner can attempt to create and validate a block. Lots of miners from around the world try to create and validate blocks at the same time. Each miner provides a mathematical \u201cproof\u201d when submitting a block to the blockchain, and this proof acts as a guarantee: if the proof exists, the block must be valid.For a block to be added to the main blockchain, the miner must prove it faster than any other competitor miner. The process of validating each block by having a miner provide a mathematical proof is known as a \u201cproof of work.\u201dA miner who validates a new block is rewarded with a certain amount of value for doing this work. What is that value? The Ethereum blockchain uses an intrinsic digital token called \u201cEther.\u201d Every time a miner proves a block, new Ether tokens are generated and awarded.You might wonder: what guarantees that everyone sticks to one chain of blocks? How can we be sure that there doesn\u2019t exist a subset of miners who will decide to create their own chain of blocks?Earlier, we defined a blockchain as a transactional singleton machine with shared-state. Using this definition, we can understand the correct current state is a single global truth, which everyone must accept. Having multiple states (or chains) would ruin the whole system, because it would be impossible to agree on which state was the correct one. If the chains were to diverge, you might own 10 coins on one chain, 20 on another, and 40 on another. In this scenario, there would be no way to determine which chain was the most \u201cvalid.\u201dWhenever multiple paths are generated, a \u201cfork\u201d occurs. We typically want to avoid forks, because they disrupt the system and force people to choose which chain they \u201cbelieve\u201d in.To determine which path is most valid and prevent multiple chains, Ethereum uses a mechanism called the \u201cGHOST protocol.\u201d\u201cGHOST\u201d = \u201cGreedy Heaviest Observed Subtree\u201dIn simple terms, the GHOST protocol says we must pick the path that has had the most computation done upon it. One way to determine that path is to use the block number of the most recent block (the \u201cleaf block\u201d), which represents the total number of blocks in the current path (not counting the genesis block). The higher the block number, the longer the path and the greater the mining effort that must have gone into arriving at the leaf. Using this reasoning allows us to agree on the canonical version of the current state.Now that you\u2019ve gotten the 10,000-foot overview of what a blockchain is, let\u2019s dive deeper into the main components that the Ethereum system is comprised of:accountsstategas and feestransactionsblockstransaction executionminingproof of workOne note before getting started: whenever I say \u201chash\u201d of X, I am referring to the KECCAK-256 hash, which Ethereum uses.AccountsThe global \u201cshared-state\u201d of Ethereum is comprised of many small objects (\u201caccounts\u201d) that are able to interact with one another through a message-passing framework. Each account has a state associated with it and a 20-byte address. An address in Ethereum is a 160-bit identifier that is used to identify any account.There are two types of accounts:Externally owned accounts, which are controlled by private keys and have no code associated with them.Contract accounts, which are controlled by their contract code and have code associated with them.Externally owned accounts vs. contract accountsIt\u2019s important to understand a fundamental difference between externally owned accounts and contract accounts. An externally owned account can send messages to other externally owned accounts OR to other contract accounts by creating and signing a transaction using its private key. A message between two externally owned accounts is simply a value transfer. But a message from an externally owned account to a contract account activates the contract account\u2019s code, allowing it to perform various actions (e.g. transfer tokens, write to internal storage, mint new tokens, perform some calculation, create new contracts, etc.).Unlike externally owned accounts, contract accounts can\u2019t initiate new transactions on their own. Instead, contract accounts can only fire transactions in response to other transactions they have received (from an externally owned account or from another contract account). We\u2019ll learn more about contract-to-contract calls in the \u201cTransactions and Messages\u201d section.Therefore, any action that occurs on the Ethereum blockchain is always set in motion by transactions fired from externally controlled accounts.Account stateThe account state consists of four components, which are present regardless of the type of account:nonce: If the account is an externally owned account, this number represents the number of transactions sent from the account\u2019s address. If the account is a contract account, the nonce is the number of contracts created by the account.balance: The number of Wei owned by this address. There are 1e+18 Wei per Ether.storageRoot: A hash of the root node of a Merkle Patricia tree (we\u2019ll explain Merkle trees later on). This tree encodes the hash of the storage contents of this account, and is empty by default.codeHash: The hash of the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine \u2014 more on this later) code of this account. For contract accounts, this is the code that gets hashed and stored as the codeHash. For externally owned accounts, the codeHash field is the hash of the empty string.World stateOkay, so we know that Ethereum\u2019s global state consists of a mapping between account addresses and the account states. This mapping is stored in a data structure known as a Merkle Patricia tree.A Merkle tree (or also referred as \u201cMerkle trie\u201d) is a type of binary tree composed of a set of nodes with:a large number of leaf nodes at the bottom of the tree that contain the underlying dataa set of intermediate nodes, where each node is the hash of its two child nodesa single root node, also formed from the hash of its two child node, representing the top of the treeThe data at the bottom of the tree is generated by splitting the data that we want to store into chunks, then splitting the chunks into buckets, and then taking the hash of each bucket and repeating the same process until the total number of hashes remaining becomes only one: the root hash.This tree is required to have a key for every value stored inside it. Beginning from the root node of the tree, the key should tell you which child node to follow to get to the corresponding value, which is stored in the leaf nodes. In Ethereum\u2019s case, the key/value mapping for the state tree is between addresses and their associated accounts, including the balance, nonce, codeHash, and storageRoot for each account (where the storageRoot is itself a tree).Source: Ethereum whitepaperThis same trie structure is used also to store transactions and receipts. More specifically, every block has a \u201cheader\u201d which stores the hash of the root node of three different Merkle trie structures, including:State trieTransactions trieReceipts trieThe ability to store all this information efficiently in Merkle tries is incredibly useful in Ethereum for what we call \u201clight clients\u201d or \u201clight nodes.\u201d Remember that a blockchain is maintained by a bunch of nodes. Broadly speaking, there are two types of nodes: full nodes and light nodes.A full archive node synchronizes the blockchain by downloading the full chain, from the genesis block to the current head block, executing all of the transactions contained within. Typically, miners store the full archive node, because they are required to do so for the mining process. It is also possible to download a full node without executing every transaction. Regardless, any full node contains the entire chain.But unless a node needs to execute every transaction or easily query historical data, there\u2019s really no need to store the entire chain. This is where the concept of a light node comes in. Instead of downloading and storing the full chain and executing all of the transactions, light nodes download only the chain of headers, from the genesis block to the current head, without executing any transactions or retrieving any associated state. Because light nodes have access to block headers, which contain hashes of three tries, they can still easily generate and receive verifiable answers about transactions, events, balances, etc.The reason this works is because hashes in the Merkle tree propagate upward \u2014 if a malicious user attempts to swap a fake transaction into the bottom of a Merkle tree, this change will cause a change in the hash of the node above, which will change the hash of the node above that, and so on, until it eventually changes the root of the tree.Any node that wants to verify a piece of data can use something called a \u201cMerkle proof\u201d to do so. A Merkle proof consists of:A chunk of data to be verified and its hashThe root hash of the treeThe \u201cbranch\u201d (all of the partner hashes going up along the path from the chunk to the root)Anyone reading the proof can verify that the hashing for that branch is consistent all the way up the tree, and therefore that the given chunk is actually at that position in the tree.In summary, the benefit of using a Merkle Patricia tree is that the root node of this structure is cryptographically dependent on the data stored in the tree, and so the hash of the root node can be used as a secure identity for this data. Since the block header includes the root hash of the state, transactions, and receipts trees, any node can validate a small part of state of Ethereum without needing to store the entire state, which can be potentially unbounded in size.Gas and paymentOne very important concept in Ethereum is the concept of fees. Every computation that occurs as a result of a transaction on the Ethereum network incurs a fee \u2014 there\u2019s no free lunch! This fee is paid in a denomination called \u201cgas.\u201dGas is the unit used to measure the fees required for a particular computation. Gas price is the amount of Ether you are willing to spend on every unit of gas, and is measured in \u201cgwei.\u201d \u201cWei\u201d is the smallest unit of Ether, where 1\u2070\u00b9\u2078 Wei represents 1 Ether. One gwei is 1,000,000,000 Wei.With every transaction, a sender sets a gas limit and gas price. The product of gas price and gas limit represents the maximum amount of Wei that the sender is willing to pay for executing a transaction.For example, let\u2019s say the sender sets the gas limit to 50,000 and a gas price to 20 gwei. This implies that the sender is willing to spend at most 50,000 x 20 gwei = 1,000,000,000,000,000 Wei = 0.001 Ether to execute that transaction.Remember that the gas limit represents the maximum gas the sender is willing to spend money on. If they have enough Ether in their account balance to cover this maximum, they\u2019re good to go. The sender is refunded for any unused gas at the end of the transaction, exchanged at the original rate.In the case that the sender does not provide the necessary gas to execute the transaction, the transaction runs \u201cout of gas\u201d and is considered invalid. In this case, the transaction processing aborts and any state changes that occurred are reversed, such that we end up back at the state of Ethereum prior to the transaction. Additionally, a record of the transaction failing gets recorded, showing what transaction was attempted and where it failed. And since the machine already expended effort to run the calculations before running out of gas, logically, none of the gas is refunded to the sender.Where exactly does this gas money go? All the money spent on gas by the sender is sent to the \u201cbeneficiary\u201d address, which is typically the miner\u2019s address. Since miners are expending the effort to run computations and validate transactions, miners receive the gas fee as a reward.Typically, the higher the gas price the sender is willing to pay, the greater the value the miner derives from the transaction. Thus, the more likely miners will be to select it. In this way, miners are free to choose which transactions they want to validate or ignore. In order to guide senders on what gas price to set, miners have the option of advertising the minimum gas price for which they will execute transactions.There are fees for storage, tooNot only is gas used to pay for computation steps, it is also used to pay for storage usage. The total fee for storage is proportional to the smallest multiple of 32 bytes used.Fees for storage have some nuanced aspects. For example, since increased storage increases the size of the Ethereum state database on all nodes, there\u2019s an incentive to keep the amount of data stored small. For this reason, if a transaction has a step that clears an entry in the storage, the fee for executing that operation of is waived, AND a refund is given for freeing up storage space.What\u2019s the purpose of fees?One important aspect of the way the Ethereum works is that every single operation executed by the network is simultaneously effected by every full node. However, computational steps on the Ethereum Virtual Machine are very expensive. Therefore, Ethereum smart contracts are best used for simple tasks, like running simple business logic or verifying signatures and other cryptographic objects, rather than more complex uses, like file storage, email, or machine learning, which can put a strain on the network. Imposing fees prevents users from overtaxing the network.Ethereum is a Turing complete language. (In short, a Turing machine is a machine that can simulate any computer algorithm (for those not familiar with Turing machines, check out this and this). This allows for loops and makes Ethereum susceptible to the halting problem, a problem in which you cannot determine whether or not a program will run infinitely. If there were no fees, a malicious actor could easily try to disrupt the network by executing an infinite loop within a transaction, without any repercussions. Thus, fees protect the network from deliberate attacks.You might be thinking, \u201cwhy do we also have to pay for storage?\u201d Well, just like computation, storage on the Ethereum network is a cost that the entire network has to take the burden of.Transaction and messagesWe noted earlier that Ethereum is a transaction-based state machine. In other words, transactions occurring between different accounts are what move the global state of Ethereum from one state to the next.In the most basic sense, a transaction is a cryptographically signed piece of instruction that is generated by an externally owned account, serialized, and then submitted to the blockchain.There are two types of transactions: message calls and contract creations (i.e. transactions that create new Ethereum contracts).   All transactions contain the following components, regardless of their type:nonce: a count of the number of transactions sent by the sender.gasPrice: the number of Wei that the sender is willing to pay per unit of gas required to execute the transaction.gasLimit: the maximum amount of gas that the sender is willing to pay for executing this transaction. This amount is set and paid upfront, before any computation is done.to: the address of the recipient. In a contract-creating transaction, the contract account address does not yet exist, and so an empty value is used.value: the amount of Wei to be transferred from the sender to the recipient. In a contract-creating transaction, this value serves as the starting balance within the newly created contract account.v, r, s: used to generate the signature that identifies the sender of the transaction.init (only exists for contract-creating transactions): An EVM code fragment that is used to initialize the new contract account. init is run only once, and then is discarded. When init is first run, it returns the body of the account code, which is the piece of code that is permanently associated with the contract account.data (optional field that only exists for message calls): the input data (i.e. parameters) of the message call. For example, if a smart contract serves as a domain registration service, a call to that contract might expect input fields such as the domain and IP address.We learned in the \u201cAccounts\u201d section that transactions \u2014 both message calls and contract-creating transactions \u2014 are always initiated by externally owned accounts and submitted to the blockchain. Another way to think about it is that transactions are what bridge the external world to the internal state of Ethereum.But this doesn\u2019t mean that contracts can\u2019t talk to other contracts. Contracts that exist within the global scope of Ethereum\u2019s state can talk to other contracts within that same scope. The way they do this is via \u201cmessages\u201d or \u201cinternal transactions\u201d to other contracts. We can think of messages or internal transactions as being similar to transactions, with the major difference that they are NOT generated by externally owned accounts. Instead, they are generated by contracts. They are virtual objects that, unlike transactions, are not serialized and only exist in the Ethereum execution environment.When one contract sends an internal transaction to another contract, the associated code that exists on the recipient contract account is executed.One important thing to note is that internal transactions or messages don\u2019t contain a gasLimit. This is because the gas limit is determined by the external creator of the original transaction (i.e. some externally owned account). The gas limit that the externally owned account sets must be high enough to carry out the transaction, including any sub-executions that occur as a result of that transaction, such as contract-to-contract messages. If, in the chain of transactions and messages, a particular message execution runs out of gas, then that message\u2019s execution will revert, along with any subsequent messages triggered by the execution. However, the parent execution does not need to revert.BlocksAll transactions are grouped together into \u201cblocks.\u201d A blockchain contains a series of such blocks that are chained together.In Ethereum, a block consists of:the block headerinformation about the set of transactions included in that blocka set of other block headers for the current block\u2019s ommers.Ommers explainedWhat the heck is an \u201commer?\u201d An ommer is a block whose parent is equal to the current block\u2019s parent\u2019s parent. Let\u2019s take a quick dive into what ommers are used for and why a block contains the block headers for ommers.Because of the way Ethereum is built, block times are much lower (~15 seconds) than those of other blockchains, like Bitcoin (~10 minutes). This enables faster transaction processing. However, one of the downsides of shorter block times is that more competing block solutions are found by miners. These competing blocks are also referred to as \u201corphaned blocks\u201d (i.e. mined blocks do not make it into the main chain).The purpose of ommers is to help reward miners for including these orphaned blocks. The ommers that miners include must be \u201cvalid,\u201d meaning within the sixth generation or smaller of the present block. After six children, stale orphaned blocks can no longer be referenced (because including older transactions would complicate things a bit).Ommer blocks receive a smaller reward than a full block. Nonetheless, there\u2019s still some incentive for miners to include these orphaned blocks and reap a reward.Block headerLet\u2019s get back to blocks for a moment. We mentioned previously that every block has a block \u201cheader,\u201d but what exactly is this?   A block header is a portion of the block consisting of:parentHash: a hash of the parent block\u2019s header (this is what makes the block set a \u201cchain\u201d)ommersHash: a hash of the current block\u2019s list of ommersbeneficiary: the account address that receives the fees for mining this blockstateRoot: the hash of the root node of the state trie (recall how we learned that the state trie is stored in the header and makes it easy for light clients to verify anything about the state)transactionsRoot: the hash of the root node of the trie that contains all transactions listed in this blockreceiptsRoot: the hash of the root node of the trie that contains the receipts of all transactions listed in this blocklogsBloom: a Bloom filter (data structure) that consists of log informationdifficulty: the difficulty level of this blocknumber: the count of current block (the genesis block has a block number of zero; the block number increases by 1 for each each subsequent block)gasLimit: the current gas limit per blockgasUsed: the sum of the total gas used by transactions in this blocktimestamp: the unix timestamp of this block\u2019s inceptionextraData: extra data related to this blockmixHash: a hash that, when combined with the nonce, proves that this block has carried out enough computationnonce: a hash that, when combined with the mixHash, proves that this block has carried out enough computationNotice how every block header contains three trie structures for:state (stateRoot)transactions (transactionsRoot)receipts (receiptsRoot)These trie structures are nothing but the Merkle Patricia tries we discussed earlier.Additionally, there are a few terms from the above description that are worth clarifying. Let\u2019s take a look.LogsEthereum allows for logs to make it possible to track various transactions and messages. A contract can explicitly generate a log by defining \u201cevents\u201d that it wants to log.A log entry contains:the logger\u2019s account address,a series of topics that represent various events carried out by this transaction, andany data associated with these events.Logs are stored in a bloom filter, which stores the endless log data in an efficient manner.Transaction receiptLogs stored in the header come from the log information contained in the transaction receipt. Just as you receive a receipt when you buy something at a store, Ethereum generates a receipt for every transaction. Like you\u2019d expect, each receipt contains certain information about the transaction. This receipt includes items like:the block numberblock hashtransaction hashgas used by the current transactioncumulative gas used in the current block after the current transaction has executedlogs created when executing the current transaction..and so onBlock difficultyThe \u201cdifficulty\u201d of a block is used to enforce consistency in the time it takes to validate blocks. The genesis block has a difficulty of 131,072, and a special formula is used to calculate the difficulty of every block thereafter. If a certain block is validated more quickly than the previous block, the Ethereum protocol increases that block\u2019s difficulty.The difficulty of the block affects the nonce, which is a hash that must be calculated when mining a block, using the proof-of-work algorithm.The relationship between the block\u2019s difficulty and nonce is mathematically formalized as:where Hd is the difficulty.The only way to find a nonce that meets a difficulty threshold is to use the proof-of-work algorithm to enumerate all of the possibilities. The expected time to find a solution is proportional to the difficulty \u2014 the higher the difficulty, the harder it becomes to find the nonce, and so the harder it is to validate the block, which in turn increases the time it takes to validate a new block. So, by adjusting the difficulty of a block, the protocol can adjust how long it takes to validate a block.If, on the other hand, validation time is getting slower, the protocol decreases the difficulty. In this way, the validation time self-adjusts to maintain a constant rate \u2014 on average, one block every 15 seconds.Transaction ExecutionWe\u2019ve come to one of the most complex parts of the Ethereum protocol: the execution of a transaction. Say you send a transaction off into the Ethereum network to be processed. What happens to transition the state of Ethereum to include your transaction?First, all transactions must meet an initial set of requirements in order to be executed. These include:The transaction must be a properly formatted RLP. \u201cRLP\u201d stands for \u201cRecursive Length Prefix\u201d and is a data format used to encode nested arrays of binary data. RLP is the format Ethereum uses to serialize objects.Valid transaction signature.Valid transaction nonce. Recall that the nonce of an account is the count of transactions sent from that account. To be valid, a transaction nonce must be equal to the sender account\u2019s nonce.The transaction\u2019s gas limit must be equal to or greater than the intrinsic gas used by the transaction. The intrinsic gas includes:a predefined cost of 21,000 gas for executing the transactiona gas fee for data sent with the transaction (4 gas for every byte of data or code that equals zero, and 68 gas for every non-zero byte of data or code)if the transaction is a contract-creating transaction, an additional 32,000 gasThe sender\u2019s account balance must have enough Ether to cover the \u201cupfront\u201d gas costs that the sender must pay. The calculation for the upfront gas cost is simple: First, the transaction\u2019s gas limit is multiplied by the transaction\u2019s gas price to determine the maximum gas cost. Then, this maximum cost is added to the total value being transferred from the sender to the recipient.If the transaction meets all of the above requirements for validity, then we move onto the next step.First, we deduct the upfront cost of execution from the sender\u2019s balance, and increase the nonce of the sender\u2019s account by 1 to account for the current transaction. At this point, we can calculate the gas remaining as the total gas limit for the transaction minus the intrinsic gas used.Next, the transaction starts executing. Throughout the execution of a transaction, Ethereum keeps track of the \u201csubstate.\u201d This substate is a way to record information accrued during the transaction that will be needed immediately after the transaction completes. Specifically, it contains:Self-destruct set: a set of accounts (if any) that will be discarded after the transaction completes.Log series: archived and indexable checkpoints of the virtual machine\u2019s code execution.Refund balance: the amount to be refunded to the sender account after the transaction. Remember how we mentioned that storage in Ethereum costs money, and that a sender is refunded for clearing up storage? Ethereum keeps track of this using a refund counter. The refund counter starts at zero and increments every time the contract deletes something in storage.Next, the various computations required by the transaction are processed.Once all the steps required by the transaction have been processed, and assuming there is no invalid state, the state is finalized by determining the amount of unused gas to be refunded to the sender. In addition to the unused gas, the sender is also refunded some allowance from the \u201crefund balance\u201d that we described above.Once the sender is refunded:the Ether for the gas is given to the minerthe gas used by the transaction is added to the block gas counter (which keeps track of the total gas used by all transactions in the block, and is useful when validating a block)all accounts in the self-destruct set (if any) are deletedFinally, we\u2019re left with the new state and a set of the logs created by the transaction.Now that we\u2019ve covered the basics of transaction execution, let\u2019s look at some of the differences between contract-creating transactions and message calls.Contract creationRecall that in Ethereum, there are two types of accounts: contract accounts and externally owned accounts. When we say a transaction is \u201ccontract-creating,\u201d we mean that the purpose of the transaction is to create a new contract account.In order to create a new contract account, we first declare the address of the new account using a special formula. Then we initialize the new account by:Setting the nonce to zeroIf the sender sent some amount of Ether as value with the transaction, setting the account balance to that valueDeducting the value added to this new account\u2019s balance from the sender\u2019s balanceSetting the storage as emptySetting the contract\u2019s codeHash as the hash of an empty stringOnce we initialize the account, we can actually create the account, using the init code sent with the transaction (see the \u201cTransaction and messages\u201d section for a refresher on the init code). What happens during the execution of this init code is varied. Depending on the constructor of the contract, it might update the account\u2019s storage, create other contract accounts, make other message calls, etc.As the code to initialize a contract is executed, it uses gas. The transaction is not allowed to use up more gas than the remaining gas. If it does, the execution will hit an out-of-gas (OOG) exception and exit. If the transaction exits due to an out-of-gas exception, then the state is reverted to the point immediately prior to transaction. The sender is not refunded the gas that was spent before running out.Boo hoo.However, if the sender sent any Ether value with the transaction, the Ether value will be refunded even if the contract creation fails. Phew!If the initialization code executes successfully, a final contract-creation cost is paid. This is a storage cost, and is proportional to the size of the created contract\u2019s code (again, no free lunch!) If there\u2019s not enough gas remaining to pay this final cost, then the transaction again declares an out-of-gas exception and aborts.If all goes well and we make it this far without exceptions, then any remaining unused gas is refunded to the original sender of the transaction, and the altered state is now allowed to persist!Hooray!Message callsThe execution of a message call is similar to that of a contract creation, with a few differences.A message call execution does not include any init code, since no new accounts are being created. However, it can contain input data, if this data was provided by the transaction sender. Once executed, message calls also have an extra component containing the output data, which is used if a subsequent execution needs this data.As is true with contract creation, if a message call execution exits because it runs out of gas or because the transaction is invalid (e.g. stack overflow, invalid jump destination, or invalid instruction), none of the gas used is refunded to the original caller. Instead, all of the remaining unused gas is consumed, and the state is reset to the point immediately prior to balance transfer.Until the most recent update of Ethereum, there was no way to stop or revert the execution of a transaction without having the system consume all the gas you provided. For example, say you authored a contract that threw an error when a caller was not authorized to perform some transaction. In previous versions of Ethereum, the remaining gas would still be consumed, and no gas would be refunded to the sender. But the Byzantium update includes a new \u201crevert\u201d code that allows a contract to stop execution and revert state changes, without consuming the remaining gas, and with the ability to return a reason for the failed transaction. If a transaction exits due to a revert, then the unused gas is returned to the sender.Execution modelSo far, we\u2019ve learned about the series of steps that have to happen for a transaction to execute from start to finish. Now, we\u2019ll look at how the transaction actually executes within the VM.The part of the protocol that actually handles processing the transactions is Ethereum\u2019s own virtual machine, known as the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).The EVM is a Turing complete virtual machine, as defined earlier. The only limitation the EVM has that a typical Turing complete machine does not is that the EVM is intrinsically bound by gas. Thus, the total amount of computation that can be done is intrinsically limited by the amount of gas provided.Source: CMUMoreover, the EVM has a stack-based architecture. A stack machine is a computer that uses a last-in, first-out stack to hold temporary values.The size of each stack item in the EVM is 256-bit, and the stack has a maximum size of 1024.The EVM has memory, where items are stored as word-addressed byte arrays. Memory is volatile, meaning it is not permanent.The EVM also has storage. Unlike memory, storage is non-volatile and is maintained as part of the system state. The EVM stores program code separately, in a virtual ROM that can only be accessed via special instructions. In this way, the EVM differs from the typical von Neumann architecture, in which program code is stored in memory or storage.The EVM also has its own language: \u201cEVM bytecode.\u201d When a programmer like you or me writes smart contracts that operate on Ethereum, we typically write code in a higher-level language such as Solidity. We can then compile that down to EVM bytecode that the EVM can understand.Okay, now on to execution.Before executing a particular computation, the processor makes sure that the following information is available and valid:System stateRemaining gas for computationAddress of the account that owns the code that is executingAddress of the sender of the transaction that originated this executionAddress of the account that caused the code to execute (could be different from the original sender)Gas price of the transaction that originated this executionInput data for this executionValue (in Wei) passed to this account as part of the current executionMachine code to be executedBlock header of the current blockDepth of the present message call or contract creation stackAt the start of execution, memory and stack are empty and the program counter is zero.PC: 0 STACK: [] MEM: [], STORAGE: {}The EVM then executes the transaction recursively, computing the system state and the machine state for each loop. The system state is simply Ethereum\u2019s global state. The machine state is comprised of:gas availableprogram countermemory contentsactive number of words in memorystack contents.Stack items are added or removed from the leftmost portion of the series.On each cycle, the appropriate gas amount is reduced from the remaining gas, and the program counter increments.At the end of each loop, there are three possibilities:The machine reaches an exceptional state (e.g. insufficient gas, invalid instructions, insufficient stack items, stack items would overflow above 1024, invalid JUMP/JUMPI destination, etc.) and so must be halted, with any changes discardedThe sequence continues to process into the next loopThe machine reaches a controlled halt (the end of the execution process)Assuming the execution doesn\u2019t hit an exceptional state and reaches a \u201ccontrolled\u201d or normal halt, the machine generates the resultant state, the remaining gas after this execution, the accrued substate, and the resultant output.Phew. We got through one of the most complex parts of Ethereum. Even if you didn\u2019t fully comprehend this part, that\u2019s okay. You don\u2019t really need to understand the nitty gritty execution details unless you\u2019re working at a very deep level.How a block gets finalizedFinally, let\u2019s look at how a block of many transactions gets finalized.When we say \u201cfinalized,\u201d it can mean two different things, depending on whether the block is new or existing. If it\u2019s a new block, we\u2019re referring to the process required for mining this block. If it\u2019s an existing block, then we\u2019re talking about the process of validating the block. In either case, there are four requirements for a block to be \u201cfinalized\u201d: 1) Validate (or, if mining, determine) ommers Each ommer block within the block header must be a valid header and be within the sixth generation of the present block. 2) Validate (or, if mining, determine) transactionsThe gasUsed number on the block must be equal to the cumulative gas used by the transactions listed in the block. (Recall that when executing a transaction, we keep track of the block gas counter, which keeps track of the total gas used by all transactions in the block). 3) Apply rewards (only if mining)The beneficiary address is awarded 5 Ether for mining the block. (Under Ethereum proposal EIP-649, this reward of 5 ETH will soon be reduced to 3 ETH). Additionally, for each ommer, the current block\u2019s beneficiary is awarded an additional 1/32 of the current block reward. Lastly, the beneficiary of the ommer block(s) also gets awarded a certain amount (there\u2019s a special formula for how this is calculated).  4) Verify (or, if mining, compute a valid) state and nonceEnsure that all transactions and resultant state changes are applied, and then define the new block as the state after the block reward has been applied to the final transaction\u2019s resultant state. Verification occurs by checking this final state against the state trie stored in the header.Mining proof of workThe \u201cBlocks\u201d section briefly addressed the concept of block difficulty. The algorithm that gives meaning to block difficulty is called Proof of Work (PoW).Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-work algorithm is called \u201cEthash\u201d (previously known as Dagger-Hashimoto).The algorithm is formally defined as:where m is the mixHash, n is the nonce, Hn is the new block\u2019s header (excluding the nonce and mixHash components, which have to be computed), Hn is the nonce of the block header, and d is the DAG, which is a large data set.In the \u201cBlocks\u201d section, we talked about the various items that exist in a block header. Two of those components were called the mixHash and the nonce. As you may recall:mixHash is a hash that, when combined with the nonce, proves that this block has carried out enough computationnonce is a hash that, when combined with the mixHash, proves that this block has carried out enough computationThe PoW function is used to evaluate these two items.How exactly the mixHash and nonce are calculated using the PoW function is somewhat complex, and something we can delve deeper into in a separate post. But at a high level, it works like this:A \u201cseed\u201d is calculated for each block. This seed is different for every \u201cepoch,\u201d where each epoch is 30,000 blocks long. For the first epoch, the seed is the hash of a series of 32 bytes of zeros. For every subsequent epoch, it is the hash of the previous seed hash. Using this seed, a node can calculate a pseudo-random \u201ccache.\u201dThis cache is incredibly useful because it enables the concept of \u201clight nodes,\u201d which we discussed previously in this post. The purpose of light nodes is to afford certain nodes the ability to efficiently verify a transaction without the burden of storing the entire blockchain dataset. A light node can verify the validity of a transaction based solely on this cache, because the cache can regenerate the specific block it needs to verify.Using the cache, a node can generate the DAG \u201cdataset,\u201d where each item in the dataset depends on a small number of pseudo-randomly-selected items from the cache. In order to be a miner, you must generate this full dataset; all full clients and miners store this dataset, and the dataset grows linearly with time.Miners can then take random slices of the dataset and put them through a mathematical function to hash them together into a \u201cmixHash.\u201d A miner will repeatedly generate a mixHash until the output is below the desired target nonce. When the output meets this requirement, this nonce is considered valid and the block can be added to the chain.Mining as a security mechanism Overall, the purpose of the PoW is to prove, in a cryptographically secure way, that a particular amount of computation has been expended to generate some output (i.e. the nonce). This is because there is no better way to find a nonce that is below the required threshold other than to enumerate all the possibilities. The outputs of repeatedly applying the hash function have a uniform distribution, and so we can be assured that, on average, the time needed to find such a nonce depends on the difficulty threshold. The higher the difficulty, the longer it takes to solve for the nonce. In this way, the PoW algorithm gives meaning to the concept of difficulty, which is used to enforce blockchain security.What do we mean by blockchain security? It\u2019s simple: we want to create a blockchain that EVERYONE trusts. As we discussed previously in this post, if more than one chain existed, users would lose trust, because they would be unable to reasonably determine which chain was the \u201cvalid\u201d chain. In order for a group of users to accept the underlying state that is stored on a blockchain, we need a single canonical blockchain that a group of people believes in.This is exactly what the PoW algorithm does: it ensures that a particular blockchain will remain canonical into the future, making it incredibly difficult for an attacker to create new blocks that overwrite a certain part of history (e.g. by erasing transactions or creating fake transactions) or maintain a fork. To have their block validated first, an attacker would need to consistently solve for the nonce faster than anyone else in the network, such that the network believes their chain is the heaviest chain (based on the principles of the GHOST protocol we mentioned earlier). This would be impossible unless the attacker had more than half of the network mining power, a scenario known as the majority 51% attack.Mining as a wealth distribution mechanismBeyond providing a secure blockchain, PoW is also a way to distribute wealth to those who expend their computation for providing this security. Recall that a miner receives a reward for mining a block, including:a static block reward of 5 ether for the \u201cwinning\u2019\u201d block (soon to be changed to 3 ether)the cost of gas expended within the block by the transactions included in the blockan extra reward for including ommers as part of the blockIn order to ensure that the use of the PoW consensus mechanism for security and wealth distribution is sustainable in the long run, Ethereum strives to instill these two properties:Make it accessible to as many people as possible. In other words, people shouldn\u2019t need specialized or uncommon hardware to run the algorithm. The purpose of this is to make the wealth distribution model as open as possible so that anyone can provide any amount of compute power in return for Ether.Reduce the possibility for any single node (or small set) to make a disproportionate amount of profit. Any node that can make a disproportionate amount of profit means that the node has a large influence on determining the canonical blockchain. This is troublesome because it reduces network security.In the Bitcoin blockchain network, one problem that arises in relation to the above two properties is that the PoW algorithm is a SHA256 hash function. The weakness with this type of function is that it can be solved much more efficiently using specialized hardware, also known as ASICs.In order to mitigate this issue, Ethereum has chosen to make its PoW algorithm (Ethhash) sequentially memory-hard. This means that the algorithm is engineered so that calculating the nonce requires a lot of memory AND bandwidth. The large memory requirements make it hard for a computer to use its memory in parallel to discover multiple nonces simultaneously, and the high bandwidth requirements make it difficult for even a super-fast computer to discover multiple nonce simultaneously. This reduces the risk of centralization and creates a more level playing field for the nodes that are doing the verification.One thing to note is that Ethereum is transitioning from a PoW consensus mechanism to something called \u201cproof-of-stake\u201d. This is a beastly topic of its own that we can hopefully explore in a future post. \u263a\ufe0fConclusion\u2026Phew! You made it to the end. I hope?There\u2019s a lot to digest in this post, I know. If it takes you multiple reads to fully understand what\u2019s going on, that\u2019s totally fine.

Can it compete with Ethereum? Or better yet, does it even need to?Why Read This Article?NEO and Ethereum \u2014 which pill will you take? Sorry, couldn\u2019t help myself. We care about this debate because we\u2019re investors. From a developer\u2019s perspective, functionality is the most important. There is no brand loyalty in blockchain yet. So if a platform can do something better than its competitors, it will win over developers. So which one does it better?This article is long because I have chewed through all the information I could find about NEO and Ethereum and digested it for you. There are lots of articles summarizing the \u201cdifferences\u201d between Ethereum and NEO, but they do the debate little justice. They skim over things, don\u2019t explore them well, explore only one aspect, or aren\u2019t holistic in their analysis and don\u2019t explain why the differences even matter and what their relevance to the real world is. I was frustrated by the lack of a comprehensive article. This article is my response.I will admit that I explored NEO more in-depth than Ethereum. This is because so much information is widely available for Ethereum. With NEO, there is much less. As such, I focus on explaining NEO and then comparing that explanation to Ethereum\u2019s capability.So bear with me, grab yourself an espresso and lock yourself in that room you \u201cdo work in.\u201d This will be well worth your time. I also won\u2019t blame you if you just read the TLDR \u2014 Too Lazy, Didn\u2019t Read \u2014 under the articles.Let\u2019s beginIf Ethereum is Goliath, NEO is David. If Ethereum is Brad Pitt, NEO is Brad Pitt\u2019s cousin, Zach Pitt\u2014younger, better dressed, and more talented \u2014 but right now relegated to serving cocktails to Brad and his friends while he acts on the side. Ethereum did it first. It was revolutionary and exciting and took the crypto world by storm. Web 3.0. Today almost every ICO is built on Ethereum\u2019s ERC20 token platform and Vitalik Buterin is one of our time\u2019s greatest minds. Yet if we\u2019ve learned anything from the fact that Alibaba is closing in on Amazon\u2019s market cap and WeChat dominates China\u2019s social media scene, it\u2019s that China plays by their own rules. The Land of the Red Dragon uses their own technology, their own networks, and cares little for what the U.S. is doing. The question is, can NEO compete with Ethereum, and does it even need to?Ultimately, NEO and Ethereum are aiming for similar roles in the crypto community. Both want to be platforms for the new internet: for DApps (Decentralized Applications), ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings), and smart contracts.Overview of Ethereum and NeoWhile both NEO and Ethereum have generalized blockchains that provide a toolbox for would be developers, their objectives differ. I would summarize each platform\u2019s objectives as such:Ethereum\u2019s goal is to create a platform for the development of DApps in order to create a \u201cmore globally accessible, more free, and more trustworthy Internet:\u201d an internet 3.0.NEO is a blockchain project \u201cthat utilizes blockchain technology and digital identity to digitize assets, to automate the management of digital assets using smart contracts, and to realize a \u201csmart economy\u201d with a distributed network.\u201dThat\u2019s a mouthful. Let\u2019s breakdown these objectives to fully understand the projects. It\u2019s important to understand that both platforms share many of the same capabilities, but the distinction in their branded objectives is very important.Ethereum: Ethereum\u2019s goal is to be the platform for DApps and they are largely accomplishing this. They own the DApp market right now. Their roadmap is all about giving users and developers more control and more options in developing their applications.NEO: NEO is working towards developing a product for the future. It not only rebranded from Antshares to NEO in June of 2017, but they refocused their marketing as well \u2014 with enormous success. Neo\u2019s objective, while ultimately utilizing many of the same technologies as Ethereum, is to be the platform for a new smart economy.In short: Ethereum is developing in response to new demands. NEO is developing their platform in anticipation of future demands.What is a Smart Economy?The biggest difference between NEO and Ethereum is NEO\u2019s focus on a smart economy. If we want to fully understand NEO, we need to understand why this distinction is important.A smart economy will feature digitized physical assets. All of these newly digitized assets will have proof of ownership in the blockchain. These assets can be sold, traded, and leveraged through smart contracts. Their ownership can be protected and validated through the decentralized model of the blockchain. We\u2019ve already seen iterations of this: from proposed supply chain overhaul to DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations \u2014 essentially decentralized companies without a leader). I offered some real world examples of this economy in this article. Now while Ethereum will likely support many of the same capabilities that NEO has, the distinction between Ethereum and NEO\u2019s objectives is what we care about.The distinction is important because a smart economy will still be under a government and under governmental regulation. I don\u2019t trust the government as much as your next libertarian; I\u2019ve read 1984 too many times. But the fact remains that governments aren\u2019t going anywhere. Thus, for a platform to service this \u201csmart economy,\u201d that platform needs to put specific thought and intention into how it will accommodate governmental regulation. So while Ethereum might offer the similar blockchain capabilities, the fact that NEO is developing FOR THIS PURPOSE is crucial.TLDR: A smart economy is in our future. To accommodate the needs of this smart economy, the platform will need to be specifically designed for this new economy.What is NEO doing to prepare itself for the smart economy?NEO places particular emphasis on staying regulatory compliant.To do this, they need:Governments don\u2019t love these guysDigital IdentityAnonymity is great. I think privacy should be at the forefront of today\u2019s technological developments and discussions. But if companies and governments are operating on the blockchain, digitizing their assets, and issuing smart contracts, all under the watchful eye of the government, they can\u2019t have anonymity. For a platform to be regulatory compliant, digital identity \u2014 a verifiable identity in digital form \u2014 is a necessary evil.Today, digital identity is based on a system called the PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) X.509 standard. This probably means about as much as it does to you as it does to me. It just means that there is an international agreed upon standard for what constitutes a digital identity. NEO\u2019s plan is to issue digital identities in accordance to this standard and then secure them using the blockchain. Bookkeepers (read about them later) will have digital identities and real names. Because of this, judicial action can be taken against them if ever need be. This is imperative when registering financial assets on the network and staying regulatory compliant.There could also be businesses and projects that will only transact with people who have a digital identity, for regulatory reasons. NEO enables that possibility.NEO is already working in a strategic partnership with THEKEY \u2014 a project being developed on NEO\u2019s platform that will assist with providing digital identification.What about Ethereum: Ethereum requires other DApps to develop digital identities which can then be secured on the Ethereum blockchain. This isn\u2019t so unlike how it will work with NEO \u2014 however NEO has made it clear, through its plan to incorporate digital identity with its bookkeeper nodes, that integration of digital identity is of central importance to the NEO ecosystem.TLDR: Governments don\u2019t like anonymity. Industries don\u2019t like pissing off the government. If NEO wants industrial adoption, it needs to have digital identities.Digital AssetsA future digital asset?If you want a smart economy based on smart contracts, you need to be able to leverage and exchange assets beyond currency. We need to be able to digitize assets like house, property, and car ownership; gold, diamonds, and other precious elements; computers, clothes, and food; even those baseball cards your mom keeps begging you to throw away. Smart contracts become so much more powerful when we have the ability to digitize all of these assets.What about Ethereum: Very similar to the digital identity blurb. Ethereum absolutely can secure digital assets, but they won\u2019t necessarily be regulatory compliant. NEO is ensuring that issued digital asset certificates will be compliant.TDLR: Just read itNEO\u2019s complex networkThe economy is complex; it has so many interconnected pieces. NEO\u2019s platform is complex, with partnerships galore. Fully researching and understanding this is difficult. But I did it, so you don\u2019t have to! Refer back to this visual to have a solid picture of how this network interacts.Even though this looks like the deranged drawings of a conspiracist, it will make sense as you reference it while learning about NEO\u2019s networkOnChainNEO\u2019s founders Da HongFei and Erik Zhang founded a company called OnChain. Understanding OnChain is critical to understanding NEO. They\u2019re not the same company, but their interests align and they have a partnership together. OnChain\u2019s system, known as DNA (Decentralized Network Architecture) aims to work with Chinese businesses and government. NEO acts as the foundation of DNA. If OnChain can integrate with Chinese businesses and government, that will greatly spur adoption of NEO.Ultimately, DNA develops public and private blockchains for businesses. These blockchains then link up to NEO to join the decentralized economy. Businesses then have all the benefits of both private and public blockchains. Think of NEO as providing the public blockchains and OnChain\u2019s DNA providing the private blockchains. Then, they can link up and get the best of both worlds.OnChain also has several projects and partnerships and newsworthy mentions that all contribute to the DNA ecosystem:Established in 2014, this is not a fresh-off-the-shelf companyFirst Chinese blockchain company to join Hyperledger \u2014 a collaboration of projects that work towards integrating blockchain with established businesses.Legal Chain \u2014 works with Microsoft China in digitizing and securing signatures via blockchain technology.Strategic partner of Microsoft China on multiple projectsWorked with the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and IndustryVoted as KPMG\u2019s top 50 Fintech Company in ChinaPartnership with Alibaba to provide an email certification service for Ali CloudInvestment from Fosun Group\u2014China\u2019s largest private conglomerate \u2014 to integrate OnChain across their businesses.Collaboration with Chinese regional government \u2014 using OnChain to develop public services and digital identityOnChain\u2019s recent development was of the ICO Ontology. Ontology uses the same architecture as NEO but ultimately works with businesses in creating a private, encrypted data network. Essentially, this is important when we have information that we need securing, but we also need it to be private. This will enable people to bring this information in a secure manner to blockchains.References on OnChain\u2019s roadmapHonestly, I don\u2019t understand why NEO doesn\u2019t advertise their collaboration with OnChain more. NEO in itself is solid, offering several potential benefits over Ethereum. But combined with OnChain, NEO truly has the potential to implement itself as THE smart economy platform of the East.The Ethereum Comparison: Ethereum\u2019s equivalent is the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, an open source blockchain initiative dedicated to linking Ethereum with the business world. Their list of partnerships is robust and impressive \u2014 no surprise for those familiar with Ethereum. Included among their members are: BP, HP, Toyota, MasterCard, Microsoft, and Intel, among many others.TLDR: OnChain is a company partnered with NEO. They have extensive experience and many accolades in bringing blockchain to businesses. They work with companies and governments in the East. They are a huge component to NEO\u2019s potential.NEOX:NEOX is NEO\u2019s version of atomic swaps (directly swapping tokens without any exchange) and cross-chain integration. Think Ark Ecosystem. This will enable people to swap crypto assets and transact across different blockchains. It also allows smart contracts to interact across chains.NEOX is important because it allows collaboration between the blockchains (both private and public) created by OnChain and by NEO\u2019s public blockchain. As more components of the Smart Economy develop, NEOX will link them all together.Ethereum Comparison: Ethereum has the ability to do atomic swaps, but has only completed this once \u2014 this isn\u2019t to put down Ethereum; NEO has never completed one. However, Ethereum will need an outside application to accommodate large scale cross-chain integration.Not quite the City of Zion we\u2019re talking about\u2026City of Zion:City of Zion (CoZ) is an independent, open source community of developers, translators, and designers who work towards the betterment of NEO. They have received funding from NEO to help incentivize project development. The community has contributed considerably to NEO. They have developed the NEON wallet, created a NEO block scanner, translated documents for NEO, and developed the NEX platform (see below). They recently received NEO funding to award $270,000 to 10 winners as part of their DApp competition. It is incredibly advantageous to have a network of support such as CoZ.Ethereum Comparison: There isn\u2019t really a good comparison for this on the Ethereum network.NEX:Nex is an upcoming ICO developed by City of Zion that offers a platform for the creation of payment solutions and decentralized exchanges on NEO. It links to NEO with NEOX.Because of differences with NEO in the token model, account balances, and way smart contract interact \u2014 in comparison to Ethereum \u2014 NEO needed a solution to be able to effectively house decentralized exchanges. NEX offers that solution.Ethereum Comparison: Already ERC20 tokens are easy to transact with on decentralized exchanges.ProjectICO:A turnkey, all-in-one ICO company that helps blockchain companies develop: from initial idea to ICO. They recently decided to move from Ethereum to NEO. They have an interesting Reddit AMA on their reasons for switching.Ethereum Comparison: TokenHub is a similar project developing on Ethereum.Microsoft China:NEO is currently hosting a developer competition in partnership with Microsoft China with $490,000 as prize money.Ethereum Comparison: Ethereum is incredibly well connected with established corporations. NEO is playing catchup.DApps and ICOs:The bread and butter of platforms; until now, NEO has only had one ICO (Red Pulse) and one DApp (AdEx). However, with several planned in the near future and with an upgrade last month which will enable NEO smart contracts to interact with website interfaces, I think this is only the beginning for NEO.Ethereum Comparison: Ethereum hands down beats NEO in this area. Ethereum is the go-to platform for ICOs and DApps.Ecosystem RecapWe hopefully have a strong understanding of the differences in the goals of Ethereum and NEO, as well as a good overview of NEO\u2019s network and the network\u2019s advantages in the smart economy. It\u2019s important to understand this network for NEO because NEO is more than just a public blockchain, it is a piece in the larger picture. When NEO\u2019s public blockchain can link up with OnChain\u2019s private and business oriented blockchains and ultimately with all other DApps on it\u2019s platform, it could truly become a smart economy.The biggest differences between Ethereum and NEOEthereum\u2019s energy consumption could power 1,025,438 American homes for a year. \u2014 Source \u2014ProtocolEthereum uses the same protocol as Bitcoin \u2014 Proof of Work (PoW). With Proof of Work, computers on the network compete to solve mathematical formulas and win the right to confirm transactions into the blockchain, and thus, secure the network. The two major drawbacks to the PoW protocol is the danger of a 51% attack and the massive energy consumption required for network security. For these reasons, I think that PoW will soon be an outdated system, as blockchain transitions to a new protocol called Proof of Stake (PoS).Proof of Stake works similarly to PoW except that instead of computers validating the network and receiving rewards equivalent to their relative computing power, PoS uses token holders. Those who hold tokens can \u201cstake\u201d their tokens (staking means to temporarily place the tokens in a locked smart contract\u200a\u2014\u200auntil staking is over) and in exchange, confirm transactions and receive rewards based on the relative number of tokens held. In PoW, if you operate 5% of the total computing power of the network, you can expect to get 5% of the block rewards. In PoS, if you own 5% of tokens, you can also expect to receive 5% of block rewards.PoS offers a solution to the issues plaguing PoW \u2014 mainly it takes virtually no energy to run PoS \u2014 without compromising the security. I would argue that it actually improves security. With Ethereum, and all other PoW protocols, the difficulty algorithm (how hard it is to solve the mathematical formula) must constantly be updated to account for better computer hardware and more powerful mining groups. With PoS there is no need to do this. With Ethereum, you could conceivably purchase enough computing hardware to achieve a 51% attack; even after comprising the network, you would still have all of that hardware and could potentially use it to attack other PoW platforms. With PoS, because you must stake your coins, any malicious behavior results in the loss of all staked coins. So if you bought 51% of all tokens, you would immediately lose your substantial investment. In addition, the costs of purchasing 51% of the network tokens are equal for everyone. The costs of obtaining 51% of computer power \u2014 due to discounts for mass computer purchases and countries with extremely cheap electricity \u2014 are not.Byzantine Fault Tolerance attempts to solve the Byzantine General\u2019s ProblemNEO uses a protocol called dBFT (Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance) sounds like a term you\u2019d see on your AP History Test. The simplest explanation of Byzantine Fault Tolerance is the issue with how to get everyone on the network to be honest and work together \u2014 because one bad apple could ruin everything. NEO\u2019s dBFT is a modification of the classic PoS protocol, with some significant advantages and one primary disadvantage.I imagine dBFT as working similar to how the U.S. Senate works (and if that analogy made you want to just give up on Neo entirely, I understand, but hold on\u2026keep reading). If every person in America \u2014 all 323.1 million\u2014was allowed to directly participate in the governmental decision making process, it would be catastrophic. It would be brutally slow as millions competed for the microphone, all shouting their opinion and arguing with each other. Making decisions would also be agonizingly slow. So instead, everyone in the country gets a vote. And with this vote, they can elect their representatives, someone to speak for them. This system directly reflects NEO\u2019s governance. Instead of everyone participating in the validating process \u2014 which can be incredibly limiting in terms of transaction speed \u2014 those who hold NEO tokens can vote for delegates. These delegates (called bookkeepers) maintain the network for everyone. Thus, NEO can run faster, more efficiently, and with quicker and more finite decisions, and you can stay home, drink Bud Light, and watch the Patriots game with your computer in sleep mode.Remember too that these bookkeepers will have their digital identity known, making NEO much more compliant with national regulations.The disadvantage with this system is a lack of decentralization. In its purest sense, instead of thousands of validators being scattered all across the world, governance is concentrated in a few dozen validators. The majority of these nodes are currently operated by the NEO team. However, as of Quarter 1, 2018, NEO will hold less than 2/3 and will continue to hold fewer as time progresses. Regardless, NEO will never be as decentralized as other pure PoS platforms.I would however argue that Ethereum is also not as decentralized as you might think. While the PoW protocol is decentralized, you can count the number of core developer\u2019s for Ethereum on one hand. In addition, while I trust Vitalik Buterin, he does have enormous power and influence over the direction of Ethereum.Ethereum will transition to a PoS protocol in the future. They already have begun the process and the mining difficulty of confirming new blocks will increase exponentially until it is impossible to mine anymore and everyone must transition to the PoS protocol. This will happen but it is likely more than a year out.TLDR: Ethereum uses a Proof of Work protocol and will evolve into Proof of Stake. NEO uses a Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance (dBFT) protocol which is a modification of the standard proof of stake protocol.Transaction Speed:Because NEO doesn\u2019t run on PoW and has a more streamlined PoS protocol, NEO can process transactions far more quickly than Ethereum. Now when we compare these, there are both theoretical and practical speeds. Theoretical transaction speeds are the absolute maximum speed mathematically possible for the network. For NEO, this number is 10,000tps (transactions/second). Ethereum can do 30tps. In practicality, because of real world inconsistencies and difficulties, NEO can do 1,000tps in comparison to Ethereum\u2019s 15tps. As protocols improve it is possible that both platforms will approach their theoretical speed.This is an enormous difference and a massive advantage for NEO. NEO\u2019s transaction speeds could conceivably accommodate the kind of smart economy they\u2019re envisioning; Ethereum\u2019s can not. Now in exchange for this speed, NEO is not as decentralized as Ethereum. In addition, it\u2019s important to recognize that Vitalik and Ethereum are well aware of this limitation. Solutions such as Raiden and sharding (two fascinating technologies but far beyond the scope of this article) are on the roadmap for Ethereum and could drastically improve Ethereum\u2019s transaction speed.TLDR: Ethereum can transact at 15tps with a maximum of 30tps. NEO can transact at 1,000tps with a maximum of 10,000tps. Ethereum has plans and solutions to scale to close this gap.Forking and scaling:Ethereum forks to update its software, just like Bitcoin. I describe this here. Forks aren\u2019t necessarily bad, but they certainly can be. Look at Ethereum\u2019s DAO fork for an example of this. After millions were stolen from an Ethereum smart contract, Ethereum forked to refund the money to the original holders. Whether or not this decision was correct, it divided the community and Ethereum Classic was created alongside Ethereum.Forks happen because there is no finality in the consensus mechanism of Ethereum. Multiple chains in the blockchain can be created at once \u2014 ultimately, both are valid chains and can continued to be mined on. Forks happen constantly but are usually resolved when the chain with the most computer power is chosen as legitimate. With Ethereum, it\u2019s always recommended that when you place a transaction, you wait until a few blocks have been mined on top of yours before considering the transaction permanent.NEO has finality. This is because the bookkeepers must reach a 66% consensus for the transaction to be placed into the blockchain. Here is an analogy to understand this. Imagine a first grade class. Timmy asks how much chocolate milk costs. Cynthia has no concept of price (she\u2019s in first grade for God\u2019s sake) and shouts $15! A few students walk over to her in agreement. Bobby\u2019s a chocolate milk aficionado \u2014 he knows his milk. He says $1.25. Most of the room walks over to him. He has a majority. Now assuming Cynthia\u2019s group realizes their flaw and joins Bobby\u2019s group, then the group reaches consensus. But if Cynthia is having a particularly stubborn day, she could keep on with her decision \u2014 a fork. It might not be the right answer, but she still has a valid answer. This is how Ethereum works.Only in Israel do they have chocolate milk in a bag\u2026NEO works like this. Imagine the same scenario. Timmy again asks how much chocolate milk costs. First Cynthia speaks up: \u201c$15!\u201d A few murmur in support, but it\u2019s clearly not 66% of the class so her idea is discarded. Next Bobby says \u201c$1.25.\u201d 66% of the class support his claim and thus, his idea is final. With NEO, the bookkeepers each propose the correct state of the next block. When 66% of them support the proposition, the block is finalized.The implications of this are huge. Finality is incredibly important for the type of economy NEO hopes to support. The financial industry and other complicated, fast moving markets (stock markets for example), can\u2019t operate on a system without finality. They need to know that when their information is placed into the blockchain, it is there for good. They also need the assurance that their blockchain won\u2019t suddenly become irrelevant because of a fork.TLDR: Ethereum can fork; NEO can\u2019t \u2014 this is important for adoption by our real world economy.Decoupling of GAS and NEOThis may very well be NEO\u2019s most ingenious characteristic. The native token of Ethereum is ether. The gas needed to run the Ethereum network (execute contracts, conduct transactions, etc.) is actually just small units of ether. There is no separation between ether and gas.However, NEO decoupled itself from the token needed to run the network: GAS. The NEO token is like partial ownership of the NEO platform. NEO token holders are entitled to vote for bookkeepers. NEO\u2019s use as a share in the company rather than a token is furthered by the fact that NEO is non-divisible. NEO is not meant to be transacted with \u2014 that\u2019s why there is GAS.GAS is used for all operations on the NEO network. Now when a company registers or changes assets on the NEO blockchain, they pay in GAS \u2014 this GAS is then distributed to all NEO holders. Anyone can claim this GAS by just holding their NEO in a personal wallet. Such as this one: NEONBookkeepers are entitled to charge a transaction fee (in GAS) for general transactions on the blockchain that only they (the bookkeepers) receive. However, by decoupling NEO and GAS, there is an incentive to keep transaction fees low; here\u2019s why:High transaction fees, which only benefit the bookkeepers, will prevent people from wanting to register their assets on the blockchain. The less assets registered, the less rewards NEO holders will get. Thus, NEO holders are incentivized to vote in bookkeepers who will keep transaction fees low.\u201c Low transaction fees = more users = more assets registered = more GAS to NEO holders.\u201d \u2014 Malcolm Lerider from his article:Bookkeepers are primarily incentivized by their desire to secure the network. They use the network, benefit from it, and have money staked in NEO. Thus, it is advantageous for them to secure it.It is unclear how rewards will be divided amongst ether holders when Ethereum becomes Proof of Stake. However, it appears that only large Ethereum holders will be able to stake and receive rewards.The NEON Wallet with the \u201cclaim gas\u201d buttonThe genius of the NEO token is that it allows users to passively acquire GAS in their wallet. No need to run the computer, keep the wallet open, or expend electricity. No need to \u201cstake\u201d your tokens \u2014 bookkeepers do this for you. You could even have your NEO in a paper wallet. GAS is collected when you physically push the \u201cclaim GAS\u201d button. This also ensures that the NEO network doesn\u2019t need to calculate the interest of NEO holders with every block, reducing traffic and simplifying the compound interest formulas. The delegated bookkeepers maintain the network; your investment gains interest. This would not be possible without two separate tokens.Both NEO and GAS are capped at 100 million tokens.TLDR: Ethereum has one token: ether. NEO has two: NEO and GAS. There are huge advantages to having two tokens when using a proof of stake protocol.SourceSmart Contract LanguageThe biggest difference between Ethereum and NEO smart contracts is the coding language options available. With Ethereum, contracts must be written in solidity \u2014 A coding language created specifically for Ethereum. NEO on the other hand supports a variety of different languages, including the most commonly known. NEO supports five programming languages with plans to support an additional five in the future.There are certainly advantages to crafting a particular language for a particular platform. Ethereum developers designed solidity for Ethereum. However, far fewer people know solidity. By supporting the most common coding languages, NEO has an advantage in facilitating adoption. Most programmers today would have to learn solidity before working with Ethereum whereas with NEO, their knowledge is already applicable. It\u2019s also possible that existing business platforms could be placed onto the NEO blockchain without much modification.TLDR (seriously? It\u2019s like two paragraphs): Ethereum has one coding language: Solidity. NEO supports many different coding languages.Smart Contract ExecutionSmart contracts use what are called virtual machines (VM). Essentially, in layman\u2019s terms, virtual machines are machines that execute smart contracts and run inside the computers of miners or other validators. The VM is the environment that the smart contract runs in. Thus, if we want to know how efficient and effective smart contracts can be, we need to analyze the VM.NEO\u2019s VM optimizes smart contract code before executing the contract. What this means is that it takes the code and reorganizes it to make it more efficient. Imagine your mom gives you a grocery list. If it\u2019s anything like my mom\u2019s lists \u2014 and she will probably object to this \u2014 the items have no organization and I am constantly ping-ponging back and forth across the grocery store. But by organizing all the items into categories that I can then pick up together at the same part of the store (dairy, canned goods, cereals), my job becomes much quicker and easier. NEO does this; Ethereum does not. Now while this makes things much easier in the long run, in the initial phase it takes a bit longer to organize the list. NEO\u2019s contract execution takes slightly longer than Ethereum\u2019s, but is much more efficient in the long run.Ethereum plans to roll out this mechanism, but there is no timeline for it. Ultimately, this allows NEO to execute and run complex smart contracts faster and more efficiently than Ethereum.TLDR: NEO has a more efficient and faster way of executing smart contracts than Ethereum.Additional Important DifferencesNEO is theoretically quantum computer resistant, Ethereum is not \u2014 When quantum computers develop enough, blockchains could be vulnerable. NEO has theoretically designed their blockchain to account for this. Ethereum does not have that capability.sk-Snarks: Ethereum\u2019s new privacy tool. sk-Snarks is the privacy protocol of ZCash. While there are far smarter people who can explain the technology far more intelligently than me, essentially sk-Snarks is important when we want to have data or contracts whose contents are private or confidential. We need to maintain the privacy of the data, but at the same time, prove we have ownership of it. sk-Snarks allows users to prove they have ownership without actually giving up the private data. NEO has no such capabilities. However, NEO\u2019s partnership with OnChain\u2019s Ontology offers NEO a privacy solution for businesses.NEO\u2019s Recipe for SuccessIn my opinion, NEO has two possible avenues for success. NEO\u2019s two paths towards success are:The above mentioned benefits allow it to compete with Ethereum directly and it begins to be the go-to platform for ICOs and blockchain development.It doesn\u2019t compete with Ethereum but instead becomes the DApp platform and foundation of a smart economy in the East.The First PossibilityI think this is the least likely of the two paths to success. Yes, NEO beats Ethereum on several fronts. But Ethereum already is an established platform. And Ethereum will close the gap with its scaling plans in the future. To overtake Ethereum will be very difficult. However, I do think that NEO has a lot more room to grow, even if it can\u2019t fully compete with Ethereum. Already we\u2019ve seen an influx of ICOs developing on NEO \u2014 this will increase. And as it does, NEO\u2019s price will increase. I also believe that eventually the market will support more than one platform. But that doesn\u2019t mean NEO will ever replace Ethereum, especially in the West.The Second Possibility \u2014 some political analysis in here tooThis is definitely the most exciting of the two possibilities. Take the almost 1.4 billion Chinese; add to that an even larger untapped market in the surrounding area and that means that the blockchain platform that captures this market will make Ethereum\u2019s $44 billion marketcap look like chump change. And as I wrote about before, China uses their own products and businesses. The issue is, we don\u2019t even know if China is looking for a platform. Currently, China has banned all ICOs and exchanges. If the ban continues, no one will capture the Chinese ICO market \u2014 because there will be nothing to capture. So the question then is, if \u2014 and it\u2019s a big if \u2014 China legalizes ICOs, can Neo be the big man on the block?In my opinion, China will soon open up blockchain development. China right now sees an opportunity to be a global political and economical leader. Already with the world\u2019s second largest GDP, China is not afraid to adapt and evolve for the benefit of their economy. Their dedication to renewable energy exemplifies this. China was certainly not known for their environmental friendliness; but they recognized that the world was moving in that direction; they recognized the benefits it offered; and they recognized the enormous potential if they could lead the pack. And now? China is the leading investor in renewable energy.Additionally, China\u2019s political structure means that development can happen fast. They can evolve quickly and lead world renewable energy efforts because they are a one-party state. There is no balance of power and need to appeal to a divided voter base delaying development as there is in America.China knows that blockchain is going to be extraordinarily disruptive. They demonstrated this when they released their five-year blockchain plan. China banned exchanges and ICOs because they recognize the potential of blockchain. If they didn\u2019t understand its significance, they never would have banned it. They banned it because they want to control it; because they will control it. They banned it to flex their muscles, establish their power, and give them time to formulate a plan for how and when they will move forward. It\u2019s very difficult to influence things when adoption has come; it\u2019s much easier to impose early restrictions and shape the direction of the disruption.When they have their plan, they will likely become the world\u2019s leading country in blockchain technology. And with the capability for rapid economic development, when China opens up ICOs and blockchain development\u2026look out.The question then is, what will China utilize? It\u2019s possible that they design their own governmental blockchain services, but I think this is incredibly unlikely. China integrated with social media, not by banning it or by creating their own platform. Instead, they integrated by selectively banning western social media and directing the Chinese market to Tencent \u2014 in exchange, Tencent employs communist workers, stays regulatory compliant, and maintains the party\u2019s censorship. And now, Tencent is bigger than Facebook. Thus, I believe that China will join the blockchain world by integrating with an already present platform; one with a willingness to work with the Chinese government; one with a focus and framework that will support governmental compliance. NEO and OnChain fit that mold. Their work and partnerships within China, NEO\u2019s development and dedication to compliance, and their envisioned smart economy gives me confidence that when the day comes, NEO could be China\u2019s platform.Recognize that this is my own opinion. Nothing is guaranteed, especially in the crypto space. All we can do is formulate a hypothesis and provide a strong supporting argument; I hope that I at least did that.SummaryUltimately, if I had to categorize NEO and Ethereum in a few words, I would say that NEO is Ethereum but with a specific purpose: to enable a smart economy. Ethereum is just a platform to enable entrepreneurship, innovation, and development \u2014 the direction it goes is up to those individuals building on Ethereum. NEO has a direction; it is shaping its platform with a goal in mind.Yes, NEO has some definite advantages over Ethereum, but as I said, Ethereum will likely scale to close the gap as the platform gains adoption. NEO\u2019s true value is in its dedication towards fitting the mold for a regulatory compliant smart economy platform. They are doing this; now China just needs to takes notice.Disclaimer: I am invested into both Ethereum and NEO. This is not investment advice, merely my opinion on the platforms.

Perhaps more importantly, I\u2019ve decided to also share my underlying philosophy. As a reminder, I know nothing. None of this should be construed as investment advice, and you should do your own research before making any investments. I would be financially okay if I lost all of my invested money: you should make sure you could survive a total loss before investing any funds.But enough of that, how should you approach investing in cryptocurrencies? First, I advocate creating your own investment tenets. Tenets are also a crucial aspect of the product management process. I recommend creating tenets before diving into any business, project or problem.Why do we write tenets?Tenets are used to make hard decisionsEach tenet expresses the conflict arising from two (or more) competing philosophiesEach tenet ultimately demonstrates preference for one philosophy over othersMost people have their own philosophies and preferences, but they don\u2019t write them down. Writing them out is crucial because it crystalizes your thinking. Tenets are helpful when times are good and indispensable when things get tough. You should debate your tenets heavily with family, friends, and yourself. Below I share five of my cryptocurrency investment tenets:Jason\u2019s Cryptocurrency Tenets [January 2018]1) I will prioritize platform investments (think Ethereum) over application investments (think Dash). Strong infrastructure scales and changes the world. Successful applications are hard to predict and are not stable over time. Platforms better withstand changing customer needs.2) I will choose cryptocurrencies with user adoption and strong focus on user adoption over cryptocurrencies with the latest tech or prettiest whitepapers.3) I will take the super-long term view. I will prioritize cryptocurrency that have the potential to be trillion dollar businesses and will stay away from currencies with more barriers to widespread adoption. If a cryptocurrency is unlikely to ever be used en masse, I won\u2019t buy it. I investment in fundamentals not merely public opinion.4) I will greatly value signals in the market, especially signals from entities with inside information and large investment positions \u2014 potentially over even my own analysis.5) I value cryptocurrencies that demonstrate the ability to change direction, pivot quickly and make decisions over cryptocurrencies that emphasize status quo, tradition, and moving wisely but slowly. I recognize this is partly a function of team structure and leadership.After painstakingly working through my tenets, I\u2019ve researched many of the cryptocoins available today. Based on my personal investment philosophy and this research, I\u2019ve made several investments over the last month. Here\u2019s my positions as of January 11th 2018:Jason\u2019s Cryptocurrency Portfolio* as of January 11th 2018:Ethereum: 50%Stellar: 20%Neo: 20%Request Network: 10%*I\u2019ve rounded these numbers to make them prettier.Ethereum: 50%As we wrote in Blockchain Technology: \u201cBlockchain technology creates information networks. The fundamental rule of networks is that when a new person joins any network, the network becomes exponentially more valuable. As a corollary, each time another person joins a widely-used network, it becomes exponentially harder for competing networks to offer similar value to people. You use Facebook because all of your friends are on the platform. You are less likely to use a new social network because few of your friends would be on it. As a result, networks tend to produce winner-takes-all markets. Facebook, WeChat and a few other businesses, for example, dominate the social networking space. We expect a similar winner-take-all outcome for blockchain technology. So far, founders have created many hundreds of digital coins. They will create thousands more over the next few years. We expect a handful of these digital coins to successfully walk out onto the global stage, while the vast majority of these coins will ultimately become valueless.\u201dAmazon is a platform. Facebook is a platform. Platforms dominate the internet. As we\u2019ve seen from Ethereum\u2019s creation of the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) platform, platform coins will dominate the blockchain coin as well. We\u2019ll see many cryptocoins repositioning themselves as platform coins, especially starting in the second half of 2018 and into 2019 when many smaller, more niche coins start to flame out. Based on my research, Ethereum is currently best positioned to win the platform war. Pure and simple. I may change my view in the next few months or quarters but for now Ethereum gets the majority of my money.Stellar: 20%Stellar is a platform that wants to make it really easy for companies to ICO (versus using Ethereum). Stellar is ultra-focused on this use case, but that\u2019s okay, because this use case is massive.Again, per Blockchain Technology, \u201c[blockchain] technology can also make physical-world assets more liquid (easier to sell and buy) by making them more reducible. In other words, the blockchain better facilitates ownership of assets across multiple people\u2026 while mega-companies (e.g., Amazon, AirBnB) have successfully built their own digital marketplaces in the past, blockchain provides the available-to-all, trust-building, low-cost financial infrastructure via smart contracts, secure transactions, and an authoritative ledger to [almost anyone]\u2026Unlike crowd-funding sites like Kickstarter, where early backers receive nothing but a product or service, ICOs let entities actually own part of meaningful ideas.\u201dThe tokenization of assets via blockchain is going to change the world. So far, this use case is the only one Ethereum has proved it can solve and I find it possible that Stellar eats some of Ethereum\u2019s pie: I am watching Stellar carefully. Stellar focuses on usability (think: MVP) instead of extensibility (think: useless features). The founder started Mt. GOX and built the initial framework for Ripple. Stellar is backed by Stripe and has support from top advisors in tech.Neo: 20%Over the last decade, China has made it clear that they want to build their own solutions to world problems. I expect this trend to continue into the blockchain world, and expect at least a duopoly platform paradigm (at least one major smart contract platform for the West, and at least one smart contract platform for the East).Request Network: 10%Request Network is a platform specifically focused on the payments space (built on top of Ethereum). While the sized of the tokenization of assets space (e.g. ICO) is almost incalculable, the payments space remains enormous. Request Network is a big team bet. As a product leader, I value team organization a lot. I\u2019ve studied the core developers of many of the top blockchain coins, and find that most projects are being run relatively poorly compared to more traditional software development projects today (partly a function of decentralization of blockchain teams). Many teams don\u2019t have updated visions or project plans and as a result miss deadlines and seem to be prioritizing things no one wants. Request Network strikes me as agile, able to pivot quickly, and ruthlessly focused on user growth and customer experience. (I love the bi-weekly updates.). I also immensely value their time in YCombinator, the top startup incubator in the world.Like the pre-blockchain startup world, real-life customer feedback is everything. I want a team desperate to get their coin to market. From there, they can interact with real customers and then make technical changes that are likely to lead to meaningful improvements for real customers.Mainstream cryptocoins I am NOT invested in:BitcoinIn my opinion, a huge milestone for blockchain technology will be to move away from the Bitcoin Hegemony. Right now, the cryptocurrency market as whole is psychologically entwined with Bitcoin. When Bitcoin plummets, the market plummets, although we\u2019ve seen signs of change in the last few weeks. In 2018, I predict that Ethereum (or another platform) will surpass Bitcoin. The cryptocurrency market will finally detangle itself from Bitcoin.I don\u2019t find pro-Bitcoin arguments particularly strong. Initially, Bitcoin initially saw a lot of success helping entities perform discreet transactions (think: Silk Road). Currently, though, Bitcoin isn\u2019t particularly helpful in the payments space (slow, expensive, and unfocused): the digital currency is unlikely to scale to widespread user adoption for payments. Bitcoin also can\u2019t help with ICOs: it is not a platform. Perhaps most concerning, from a development perspective Bitcoin moves slowly, has divided leadership, and doesn\u2019t practice user-driven development (at least compared to other digital coins). Proponents cite these characteristics as advantages and argue that Bitcoin is a store of value.We flesh out the digital coin role as a store of value in Blockchain Technology: \u201cBlockchain technology also has potential to provide a new independent store of value. Today, the classic independent store of value, gold, is partly valuable because humans have decided to value it independently of nation states (e.g., Canada) or nation alliances (e.g., the European Union) unlike other mainstream currencies (e.g., the United States dollar is closely tied to the success of the United States of America). Gold is generally inversely correlated with the US dollar: in other words, gold acts as a hedge against the current global financial system. Because gold is difficult to store \u2014 heavy, relatively insecure \u2014 digital blockchain-currencies represent an attractive alternative. If digital currencies become more stable over time (currently, they are extremely volatile), they may one day augment or supplement assets such as gold.\u201dThe problem is that no one uses Bitcoin as a stable store of value today. Additionally, Bitcoin is relatively uncorrelated with the US dollar, so it doesn\u2019t act as a particularly useful hedge. Ultimately, I think digital coins will be strong store of values, but this is far, far down the road. At that point, I find that other cryptocoins are just as likely or more likely to act as global store of values compared to Bitcoin.I further argued that the bigger and more immediate store of value opportunity is \u201chelping entities buy into the global financial system in the first place. In developing countries, for example, many entities are eager to shift local, unstable currencies to stable currencies such as the US dollar to better protect their wealth. Like the US dollar today, the blockchain-backed currencies that facilitate world transactions tomorrow will also naturally act as a store of value. Entities will invest in these currencies as they do the US dollar today. As a result, the same blockchain-based currencies that gain mainstream adoption for payments are also likely to gain mainstream adoption as stores of value.\u201d We will be forever indebted to Bitcoin but 2018 will mark Ethereum passing Bitcoin, the marketing falling, and then ultimately rebounding stronger than before. The age of the Blockchain Platform is beginning.Privacy-centric cryptocoinWhile, private, fully-anonymous transactions are a large blockchain use case, coins emphasizing privacy will struggle to gain mass adoption in the long-term. I expect privacy-centric coins to bear the brunt of initial government scrutiny and regulation. I choose to make my investments on the more public side of the blockchain movement. That said, Monero would be my current pick in the privacy-centric digital coin space.RippleAs we wrote in Blockchain Technology: \u201cin the short-term, partial blockchain solutions [like Ripple] will become common. Already, financial institutions are creating their own private blockchain networks and producing digital coin. Participating institutions act as nodes in the blockchain, and have visibility into all transaction on the shared digital ledger.\u201dI like Ripple, and particularly the focus on getting customers. Like many others, however, I am concerned about the difference between the highly-valuable Ripple Payment Protocol and XRP as an investment vehicle. I also see in-house blockchain development from large institutions as meaningful competition.ThanksHopefully my perspective is helpful. If I helped you crystallize your own thinking, I\u2019d very much appreciate a small donation to my Ethereum wallet.Ethereum wallet: 0x81ff5029a05ce15c3b6d6e27c7d89a7c30ecaf32Or just clap a lot =)To trade, I buy Ethereum in CoinBase and then move these coins into Binance.Coinbase: https://www.coinbase.com/join/5a39ac52c9e83802d5f70a27Binance: https://www.binance.com/?ref=18572991Again, this is not investment advice.

Can it stack up to NEO and Ethereum?Noam LevensonFollowDec 29, 2017 \u00b7 22 min readTOKEN: ADACardano has been on the tip of everyone\u2019s tongue since it\u2019s enormous run up earlier this month. Even in the volatile world of cryptocurrency, Cardano\u2019s 2000% increase over three weeks was extraordinary, and the community took notice. It now sits as the 6th largest cryptocurrency market cap at over $10 billion. Yet, before Cardano and its then $700 million market cap suddenly appeared on coinmarketcap.com, most had never heard of the project before. Its sudden appearance and enormous subsequent increase have left the blockchain community scratching their heads and scouring for information.So like with any new kid on the block, we want to understand what Cardano is, what separates it from other blockchain platforms, and whether it can play centerfield for our neighborhood team\u2026This article examines Cardano both as a standalone platform, as well as in comparison to Ethereum and NEO. For an analysis of NEO versus Ethereum, you should read this. I understand that EOS and other third generation platforms are also relevant; I will research and write about those later on. Since I have already extensively covered NEO, I will dedicate this article primarily to providing an in-depth analysis of Cardano. I will also compare each unique component to those of NEO and Ethereum. I will quote directly from my past article on some aspects. Let\u2019s begin\u2026What is Cardano?Cardano is the, no-crust on his sandwich, kid at school who uses words like \u201cpeer-reviewed\u201d and reads \u201cacademic journals.\u201d He occasionally gets shoved into his locker and has never been good at sports; but 10 years later he\u2019s driving around a Ferrari and you realized you never should have judged him in the first place.Cardano, put simply, is a blockchain platform that provides a programmable blockchain and smart contracts for dApp development. But the industry is ripe with strong competition: Ethereum has first mover advantage and a large user base, NEO focuses on a smart economy, ARK has smart bridges and blockchain interoperability; so what makes Cardano special and why can it be a competitive player in the field?Cardano\u2019s One Liner: Cardano is the industry\u2019s first platform that utilizes academically peer-reviewed open source code.Definitely don\u2019t want bugs in the code for this airplane\u2019s protocol\u2026Translation? It means that the Cardano project boasts a network of global researchers and scientists that have contributed to and developed an advanced blockchain protocol. All of Cardano\u2019s protocol technology goes through an extensive peer review process, similar to the process that airplane code might go through. Their conclusion is that code that supports a global economy should have the same rigorous scrutiny as code on which lives depend.Cardano is known as a 3rd generation blockchain. Bitcoin was the 1st generation. Ethereum was the 2nd. Ethereum led the pack, but because its technology was fundamentally new, the technology was rudimentary. Now, Ethereum must rely on its governance system to upgrade and scale. 3rd generation blockchains, like Cardano, have the advantage of hindsight. They can identify the drawbacks and constraints of previous projects and develop accordingly. This is precisely the path that Cardano took. The project emerged in 2014, not with a whitepaper, but rather with collective research and collaboration, focused on identifying the limitations of present blockchains. They then proceeded to code from the ground up, attempting to address each of those limitations. Each building block was submitted to conferences and experts for review before being added to the larger building.This peer reviewed process is incredibly important, especially considering that poor coding and development can lead to catastrophic results (think Parity and DAO hacks). How many developers are there in the world who can effectively code a blockchain project? How many developers can code quality projects in an entirely new industry, on entirely new technology? I think that number is certainly less than the 1380 cryptocurrencies posted on coinmarketcap.com. So much focus has been directed towards scam projects; I think a more important focus should be placed on legitimate projects that are just done poorly. Far more people will lose money in this industry to teams and developers who just weren\u2019t very good than to criminal money grabs. So the question must be asked: how do we know a project is good? How do we know the code is kosher? One way, as Ethereum has done and NEO is doing, is through the bumpy, trial and error road of adoption. Cardano\u2019s method of peer review is another.With this philosophy of methodical and peer reviewed development, Cardano is working towards addressing the problems of 2nd generation blockchains.More Than Just CardanoBefore we get into what limitations Cardano addresses and what makes the project unique, we should understand who is behind Cardano.The project is supported by three entities, all serving different purposes within the ecosystem.The Cardano FoundationCardano is supported by a nonprofit company, known as the Cardano Foundation. The foundation serves several purposes, both to Cardano and to the blockchain community as a whole. They work towards promoting Cardano to the greater community, educating about cryptocurrency, and working with governments around regulation. An organization like this is important for the adoption of a blockchain platform; the foundation provides a standard body that can facilitate cooperation and adoption with enterprises and businesses. The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance serves a similar purpose for Ethereum. OnChain, a partner of NEO, while not a nonprofit, also serves to connect public blockchains with governments and businesses. Since blockchain platforms such as NEO, Ethereum, and Cardano are decentralized, these organizations provide a centralized body for businesses to work with. Like the publishing agency for the platform.To note too, the Cardano Foundation hosts a variety of digestible resources about Cardano. From overviews of the project and the technology to blog updates detailing exactly how the team operates, their exact working schedule, and their release timeline. I have honestly never seen such transparency.Input Output Hong Kong (IOHK)IOHK is an engineering company that develops blockchain solutions for academic institutions, corporations, and governments. The company is led by Charles Hoskinson and Jeremy Wood, former CEO and Executive Assistant of Ethereum respectively. IOHK supports Cardano and boasts an extensive research team \u2014 17 accredited individuals. This team has been responsible for the development of Cardano\u2019s technology and digital wallet. IOHK also supports several other blockchain projects, including Ethereum Classic. For the tech minded, the website features all of their peer-reviewed papers.Also, I recommend you go to the website just to play around with the colorful interface.EmurgoEmurgo, a Japanese based company, both assists established businesses with integrating blockchain technology, as well as invests in startup ventures. Emurgo\u2019s connects businesses to the Cardano blockchain.This delegation of tasks between IOHK, the Cardano Foundation, and Emurgo is interesting. I am supportive of the concept. I can understand how dividing the development and engineering from the marketing and networking might allow for a more efficient system. Each organization serves a different purpose within the ecosystem.TLDR: Cardano is supported by three organizations. The Cardano Foundation supports the platform by promoting Cardano to the greater community, educating about cryptocurrency, and working with regulation. IOHK is the engineering and development organization behind the Cardano technology. Emurgo works towards integrating the platform with businesses.What Makes Cardano Special?As Calvin Harris says, \u201cthis is what you came for.\u201dA platform can have the flashiest website, the most robust development team, and the largest collection of \u201cpeer reviewed\u201d papers, but if it\u2019s not accomplishing something new \u2014 something revolutionary \u2014 then it will die. For in this space, competition is stiff, and everyone is competing against Ethereum, the king of dApps.Cardano is ambitious, but largely undeveloped. I will explore future features that Cardano will implement, but for now, it\u2019s most important to focus on the foundation. The features and protocols that form the basis for Cardano\u2019s future.Listed in the order I explore them, I believe the unique aspects of Cardano are: layered technology, proof of stake protocol, coding language, wallet, governance model, and treasury.Cardano technology is layered like this delicious cakeLayered TechnologyWith value transfers, there are two sets of information. There is the simple, from, to whom, when, and how much \u2014 this is the only information Bitcoin can support. However, as we are aware, in our real world, value transfers are never this simple. Associated with each transaction we can also ask: what are the terms and conditions of the transfer, why was the money transferred, and what were the involved entities? This is known as metadata.Ethereum, the 2nd generation blockchain, enabled the integration of all of this information. They call the connection between the actual value transfer and the associated metadata smart contracts. Programmable contracts. However, with Ethereum, because there is no separation between accounting and computing, this information is stored together, with no consideration given as to whether the metadata always needs to be included. This is problematic. The more data that is included with each transaction, the more gas it costs, the more difficult it is for the blockchain to store that information, and the more cumbersome it is for nodes to store the history of the blockchain.Thus, Cardano separates the transfer and the why. They accomplish this by separating the platform into two distinct layers:The Cardano Settlement Layer (CSL): This layer is responsible for the token economics and the balances of all user accounts. Cardano\u2019s native currency, ADA, is transacted over this layer. In layman terms, this just means that all code relating to accounts and the ADA token exist on this layer.The Cardano Control Layer (CCL): All the smart contract functions exist on this layer. In addition, regulatory elements like digital identity can be supported by this layer.The CCL is the control tower of CardanoThe CSL only maintains the actual transaction information \u2014 for example: 3 ADA from Wallet A to Wallet B. By including only the simplified transaction information, the CSL can be like a standardized transacting protocol. Most, if not all possible transactions, are preprogrammed. Flexibility and customizability, while useful, can create security holes. However, with simple transactions, Cardano can anticipate and fix those holes from the beginning.However, Cardano still will support smart contracts. These are controlled from the CCL. The CCL allows for all the advanced programmable features of smart contracts. The why of transactions. The conditions and terms.The advantage of separating this layer from the CSL is two fold. First, it allows for the protection of transaction privacy because transactions can be conducted without the additional metadata Ethereum or NEO requires. Second, it allows for more focused scaling updates \u2014 for example, the updates might only impact the computational layer without endangering user balances or the transactional ability of the network.The best way I understand this is that there are advantages to being a cryptocurrency and there are advantages to being a platform. Cryptocurrencies protocols are simple and efficient. Platform protocols are robust and flexible. Bitcoin and Litecoin are cryptocurrencies. Ethereum and Neo are platforms first and currencies second. Cardano is both. It is the best of both worlds.TLDR: Cardano splits its protocol into two layers. One layer is focused on transactions and accounts and the other layer is the computational layer for smart contracts. This allows for easier upgrades and enhanced flexibility.Proof of Stake ProtocolIf you don\u2019t understand Proof of Stake (PoS), I recommend you read the explanation in my NEO article. It highlights the differences between PoS and what Ethereum uses: Proof of Work (PoW). Essentially, PoW uses computing power to determine who confirms the blocks on the blockchain and divvies up rewards according to how much computing power you contribute. With PoS, blocks are confirmed according to who holds the most tokens.In PoW, if you operate 5% of the total computing power of the network, you can expect to get 5% of the block rewards. In PoS, if you own 5% of tokens, you can also expect to receive 5% of block rewards.You don\u2019t need all this equipment for PoSCardano, like NEO, uses a Proof of Stake protocol. It is called Ouroboros. It is said to be the only PoS protocol with mathematically proven security. Recognize that, as with all of Cardano\u2019s technology, Ouroboros has been extensively peer-reviewed. Ouroboros specifically was developed with the help of the University of Edinburgh, University of Connecticut, IOHK, and the Tokyo Institute of Technology.As with NEO and Ark, Cardano uses a variation of the PoS protocol similar to Delegated Proof of Stake (dPoS). For reference, NEO refers to this as dBFT (delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance). dPoS permits stake holders to \u201cvote and elect\u201d representatives, known as consensus nodes, who do the block confirmations for them. The block rewards are given to the consensus nodes who then provide a payout to the token holders who voted for them.Delegated PoS is kind of like how we elect these guys to make the decisions for usWith Cardano, the system works slightly differently. Time is broken into what are called Epochs (each Epoch could be 20 minutes \u2014a totally arbitrary number). Within each Epoch, or 20 minute block, there are slots. Slots are just the to-be-mined blocks. A random algorithm selects one token holder for each slot to act as a consensus node. They are known as a slot leader. The slot leader then confirms the block and yields to the next randomly elected slot leader. All the block rewards are collected in a pool and are distributed to the slot leaders at the end of the epoch.Epochs act kind of like a shift schedule at your local Cold Stone Creamery. The schedule can be for any amount of time, just like with epochs \u2014 let\u2019s say this schedule is a week. Each shift is known as a slot. Only one person can be working each shift (or slot), but we need to have a worker for every shift. Each worker is randomly selected. With Cardano, the more tokens (ADA) you have, the more likely you are to be elected \u2014 like lottery tickets: the more you have, the better your odds. Users will also be able to pool their ADA together and share in the block rewards. Once that worker (slot leader) works their shift, the next person takes over. Epochs define slot leaders for each slot. Then, when that epoch ends, a new epoch comes online and defines all the slot leaders for that schedule. And so it goes.There is currently no staking on Cardano until the Shelley Update in Q2 of 2018. Much more information will become available then regarding exactly how the reward and staking system will work. As of now, the platform is entirely centralized as all the nodes are owned by Cardano. All network fees are collected and burned.With Cardano, extensive thought has gone into how to scale the platform. Ouroboros enables many advanced scaling options. Slot leaders can manage blocks on multiple chains. And multiple Epochs can be run simultaneously. Both of these enable a blockchain that can support scaling solutions like sidechains \u2014 multiple chains that all interoperate \u2014 and sharding \u2014 breaking the larger blockchain into manageable \u201cchunks.\u201d It is important to note that none of this has been implemented yet. It is currently being researched and will be implemented when the network needs it, estimated to be towards the end of 2018.Comparison to NEO and Ethereum: Ethereum still uses Proof of Work, which is a severe disadvantage. They are however transitioning over to a PoS system. NEO uses what is called dBFT. NEO\u2019s system allows NEO token holders to elect consensus nodes who reach consensus on the next block, not unlike Cardano. The NEO team is in the process of relinquishing control over these consensus nodes. Ethereum is working towards sharding, sidechains, and other scaling solutions. NEO\u2019s platform already has implemented more scaling solutions than Ethereum but is working towards sidechains and interoperability.TLDR: Cardano uses a Proof of Stake system called Ouroboros. The network randomly elects a node to confirm the next block and the rewards are allocated to that node. The more tokens you have the more likely you are to be elected. Token holders can also \u201cvote\u201d for nodes by contributing their tokens to them and increasing the likelihood that they are elected.Coding LanguageCardano is coded in a language called Haskell. A programmer could give you a much better sense of the full scope of this, but I understand that Haskell language is a more precise code that employs mathematical verification methods in order to limit human error and confirm the correctness of the code. Essentially, the code has a better process for verifying that it is being written correctly. This conceivably will help prevent bugs and errors, such as the one that opened the way for the DAO Hack of Ethereum or the Parity Wallet catastrophe.Cardano does plan to incorporate multiple languages into its smart contract platform in the future.Ethereum and NEO comparison: NEO allows coding in a variety of the most common coding languages, providing developers with more flexibility. Ethereum created their own language called Solidity which is optimized for Ethereum smart contracts.TLDR: Cardano uses Haskell, a much more dynamic coding language.The WalletCardano\u2019s dedicated wallet is called Daedalus. The wallet supports the network token: ADA. The wallet was developed by IOHK and is supported by an impressive team of nine developers. The wallet will be critical for when Ouroboros, the proof of stake protocol, is implemented. From the wallet, users will be able to \u201cstake\u201d their tokens and potentially be elected to confirm blocks. Or they will be able to vote for other token holders to increase their odds and share in the block rewards.I find Cardano\u2019s dedication towards their wallet encouraging. It demonstrates the team\u2019s commitment towards all the elements of the platform.Ethereum and NEO comparison: NEO has a community developed wallet, NEON, that allows NEO holders to claim GAS. Ethereum has a variety of supported wallets.TLDR: Cardano developed their own wallet, Daedalus, which supports the token: ADA.GovernanceGovernance models are crucial when evaluating the future prospects of a blockchain. Consider this quote by Fred Ehrsam from this brilliant article:\u201cThe most successful blockchains will be those that can best adapt to their environments. Assuming these systems need to evolve to survive, initial design is important, but over a long enough timeline, the mechanisms for change are most important. \u201cSo what are Cardano\u2019s mechanisms for change?Cardano wants to implement blockchain based governance. That means that decisions regarding the future of the blockchain can be voted on by token holders and enacted into protocol. They envision a library of sorts where upgrades and modifications can be proposed and then voted on by ADA holders. A certain percentage of votes would need to be obtained for the protocol to be implemented.In comparison, off-chain governance systems also do have some semblance of voting, except there isn\u2019t a uniformed voting method between all the parties. Miners vote by dedicating their computing resources (or stake in the case of PoS) to whichever blockchain fork (version) they support. Users vote through use \u2014 which chain they decide to use. Exchanges also have a vote in the form of which token they decide to support. But all of this voting occurs after the fork. Thus, on-chain governance creates a system where everyone is voting in the same format, and voting happens before implementation. To understand forks better, read the explanation in this article.As an example, look at all the Bitcoin forks. With the governance method today, forks commonly occur, but no one supports the new Bitcoin (not including Bitcoin Cash which has been widely successful) and the new token dies. With an on-chain governance system, changes can be put up to a vote; if enough people support the change, it is implemented. They don\u2019t need to fork to gauge community interest.However, there are both pros and cons to this system.Pros: this system will likely help prevent hard forks. Creating a format for discussion and voting encourages smooth network updates without the headache of violent debates and contentious forks. It effectively democratizes the process and allows for equal voting rights according to token stake. This system also decentralizes the governance. Instead of just a handful of developers taking responsibility for proposals and updates, the whole community can participate.Cons: on-chain voting also has drawbacks. Any implemented feature becomes much harder to remove should there be an issue. Governance set in code is unchangeable. We are also trusting the community to make knowledgable decisions regarding protocol changes. Systems must be in place to prevent activities like trolling. Even just plain apathy would be harmful to this system.None of this governance system is currently in place; it\u2019s all still being developed. The details of the protocol and how it will address the above concerns remain to be seen.Comparison to Ethereum and NEO: Both Ethereum and NEO use off-chain governance models. With Ethereum, updates are proposed, reviewed, and then the network forks. Miners, users, and exchanges must decide which chain to use. Ethereum\u2019s community typically agrees on updates and thus, it is generally a smooth process. However, look at Ethereum and Ethereum Classic for an example of times when a fork did not go smoothly. NEO is more centralized than Ethereum; thus, updates and protocol changes can be quickly implemented by the team. This is inline with NEO\u2019s smart economy vision.TLDR: Cardano wants to implement on-chain governance where token holders can vote on community proposed updates to the blockchain. These updates are then encoded into the blockchain.TreasuryA portion of every block reward (25%) is placed into a treasury. This treasury is decentralized and can only be accessed through the voting mechanism described above. Imagine that the Cardano community wants to run a development competition. The details are proposed to the community and ADA holders vote and approve the competition. With the treasury, the community can then vote on how to fund the competition. With a consensus vote, funds from the treasury can support projects and upgrades to the network. Perhaps researchers would one day like to receive grants to study elements of Cardano and propose improvements. The treasury system could enable this.All this helps solve the issue of how should blockchains fund themselves after their supporting companies are gone? What will Ethereum do when Vitalik leaves and the Ethereum Foundation is dissolved? What will become of NEO when the NEO Council is no more? While these platforms will continue to be self sufficient, they won\u2019t necessarily have a way of funding new ecosystem developments. This is Cardano\u2019s solution.Again, recognize that this model has not yet been implemented.Comparison to Ethereum and NEO: NEO and Ethereum do not have on-chain funding mechanisms.TLDR: Cardano will have a treasury system, funded through 25% of block rewards. ADA token holders can vote on how to spend that money.TeamAs previously mentioned, the Cardano project is supported by three organizations. However, I think IOHK is the most relevant entity to the project, as they are conducting the actual development. Charles Hoskinson and Jeremy Wood head IOHK. Charles first co-founded Invictus Innovations which established Bitshares. He then moved to Ethereum as the enacting CEO. He has been the CEO of IOHK for almost three years.Jeremy also worked for Ethereum as the Executive Assistant. He has been the CSO of IOHK for nearly three years as well.Beyond these two, Cardano features small, interdisciplinary teams of academics and developers that work on individual projects. The development to-do list is tracked and new tasks are constantly given to teams as they finish projects. Teams work in two week intervals, releasing small, incremental updates to the main projects. Cardano focuses on time based releases instead of feature based releases. By not releasing huge updates, they avoid the issue of needing to coordinate the release of all the new features.I\u2019m impressed with the transparency and the professionalism of the team. Progress updates are constantly provided and I appreciate how the system utilizes a network of developers to work quickly and efficiently.Ethereum and NEO Comparison: All three projects feature powerful teams headed by intelligent thought leaders. It\u2019s hard to not give the advantage to Ethereum and Vitalik Buterin, the Michael Jordan of blockchain thinkers.Roadmap and Current ProgressCardano\u2019s only working protocol right now is their SL Mainnet. This was launched on September 29th. SL is the Settlement Layer enabling ADA. Essentially, this means that Cardano is only a cryptocurrency; it will need to release other features to realize its promise of being a platform.Q2 of 2018 will be the next big release for Cardano. This release, titled Shelley, will enable many new features. These include: 1. The release of their proof of stake protocol \u2014 Ouroboros.2. Added incentives for running full nodes3. A wallet upgrade. This upgrade will include advanced security, multi-signatures (multiple passwords for the wallet), quantum resistant addresses, and checkpoints \u2014 a process for speeding up the sync time for the blockchain.4. The release of their on-chain voting system.After this, releases will include their smart contract platform, treasury system, and advanced scaling methods.Cardano is designing its protocol with regulation and compliance in mind. They want to create an ecosystem that supports digital identity and can work with enterprises and governments within an existing economy. Much of their future developments will focus on this principal.TLDR: So far, Cardano has only released their Settlement Layer and thus, can only act as a cryptocurrency. Future developments are in store for smart contracts and other platform innovations.Additional Relevant Information:Cardano is modeling Ouroboros and other protocol features with Psi Calculus, a formal modeling language that is machine understandable. This allows them to test their protocols before they are actually implemented.As stated in the roadmap section, Cardano plans to implement quantum safe signatures, making their blockchain theoretically safe from quantum computers. NEO has this feature implemented while Ethereum does not.Cardano\u2019s thought process regarding every decision has been documented on their website. I have never seen such transparency from a project before.Cardano\u2019s token sale was audited. You can read the report here.The network has a booming social media following. Three associated twitter pages have 72k combined followers and their Reddit has 24k followers.Red Flags and ConcernsAs with any project, it\u2019s critical that we are aware of all aspects of the project; the good and the bad.1. Still In DevelopmentCardano is still far from production ready. With the release of its SL mainnet, and native token, ADA, it is further along than some other 3rd generation blockchains such as EOS. However, we are likely still over 6 months away from just the implementation of their PoS protocol. There isn\u2019t even a release date for their smart contract platform \u2014 their CL and virtual machine. Until then, no dApps can be developed and no ICOs conducted. Ethereum already supports over 800 dApps. NEO is rapidly supporting more applications. While it\u2019s true that Cardano improves significantly on many aspects of Ethereum, Ethereum does have plans to implement scaling solutions that would close that gap. Even if Cardano is fully operational within a year, a year in the blockchain industry is an eternity in the normal world. It\u2019s possible that after a year, Ethereum will have such a chokehold on the dApp market and will be making significant progress towards its scaling solutions, that there is no place for Cardano. Right now, Cardano is a cryptocurrency; but Cardano\u2019s current $10.5 billion valuation is based on far more than it being a simple cryptocurrency.2. Governance and TreasuryCardano relies on a complicated governance system. The features of the system must be carefully crafted to align incentives and ensure that bad actors and trolls can\u2019t manipulate the system and wreak havoc. What if a group of proactive users is able to gain enough power and utilize the treasury for their own gain? While I do expect that the Cardano team will approach these questions carefully and methodically, it is still a factor to consider.ConclusionThe takeaway from this article should be such: Cardano is a 3rd generation platform that is building methodically, with peer reviewed technology, in order to address many of the scaling, privacy, and technological issues of today\u2019s 2nd generation blockchains, like Ethereum. Cardano has an advanced proof of stake protocol, a unique governance and treasury system, and a layered foundation that enables Cardano to act as both a cryptocurrency and a blockchain platform. It has a strong support network, a robust development team, and large community interest. The breadth of its roadmap is phenomenal and I am confident that Cardano can deliver on its promises.Even with all these benefits, it\u2019s difficult to effectively value Cardano and other 3rd generation platforms. Undoubtably, Cardano is doing a lot right. However, network effects play a significant role in platform valuations. Network effects refer to how the value of technology frequently depends upon how many people will use it. Thus, for Cardano to be successful, it must have users. Cardano is at least a year away from having a platform that can support users \u2014 outside of just sending and receiving ADA. Compare this to Ethereum and NEO, both of which have had large success in their respective markets. Ethereum controls the dApp development market today while NEO is making strides in being the platform in the East and enabling a smart economy. I don\u2019t see Cardano replacing either of these platforms; it won\u2019t replace NEO because their objectives and intended markets are different, and it won\u2019t replace Ethereum because I think Ethereum will succeed with many of its scaling solutions, closing the technological gap between it and Cardano.Regardless, I do think that the blockchain ecosystem can support more than one platform. Cardano\u2019s many strengths assure me that it is well situated to provide a strong alternative to Ethereum, perhaps as a platform with more flexibility and more security. For now, all we can do is wait; wait to see if Cardano stays true to its roadmap; wait to see if industries and enterprises take notice; wait and see if Cardano can be a powerhouse amongst blockchain platforms.You can buy ADA from Binance if you\u2019re interested: https://www.binance.com/?ref=10928176 (Referral Link)Disclaimer: This is not paid content; I have received no compensation for this article.

Ethereum has an order of magnitude more developers building on it than any other platform \u2014 and this gap is widening by the dayOur Ethereum code school CryptoZombies.io has now had over 207,623+ users since we launched it last November \u2014 and this number has been growing consistently by over 30,000+ users per month, with no signs of slowing down.Truffle (a development framework for Etheruem) has had almost 550,000 downloads, growing at over 45,000+ users per month since January.Simply put, the number of developers building on top of Ethereum is not only growing \u2014 it\u2019s accelerating.The number of developers using Ethereum\u2019s Truffle Suite each month is not only growing \u2014 it\u2019s accelerating.That means if another blockchain platform wants to beat Ethereum in terms of developer adoption, it\u2019s not enough for it to catch up to where Ethereum is now \u2014 it has to exceed Ethereum\u2019s growth rate moving forward.Why is developer adoption important?At the end of the day, it doesn\u2019t matter how many transactions per second your blockchain can handle if no one is actually using it.And in order to have applications worth using, you need to attract enough developers to build them.If you don\u2019t have developers building applications on your blockchain, you\u2019re effectively building a ghost town.I\u2019m not sure what caused Steve Ballmer to go nuts on stage at this conference and create this classic moment in meme history, but I\u2019m including him here to emphasize my point: Developer adoption is everything.The blockchain platform that has the most developers building real-world applications on top of it will be the platform that gains the widest mainstream adoption. And not only does Ethereum have a massive head start in this area, but the gap is widening with each day that passes.And why is Ethereum attracting the most developers?2. Ethereum has better tools and infrastructure for DApp development than any other platformTruffle. Infura. Web3.js. OpenZeppelin. Geth. Ganache. MetaMask. CryptoZombies. MyCrypto. Etherscan. ERC20 and ERC721.These are tools (among many others) that different developer teams have tirelessly poured hundreds of thousands of hours into \u2014 and they\u2019re free to use for any Ethereum developer who wants to build a DApp on Ethereum.And this developer ecosystem is only growing as time goes on. Our team and at least a dozen others are in the process of building even more tools and infrastructure around Ethereum DApp development that will make Ethereum developers\u2019 lives even easier in the future.It\u2019s Metcalfe\u2019s law applied to developer infrastructure. The more developers building useful stuff, the easier (and more enjoyable) it becomes for new developers to build, and the effect compounds on itself.If you\u2019re a developer and you wanted to build a blockchain platform that replaces Ethereum, you would need to build equivalent versions of all of these tools on top of your own platform in order to compete with Ethereum\u2019s ease-of-use for developers.Or you could, you know\u2026 just build on top of Ethereum, and take advantage of all these things out of the box \ud83e\udd14But let\u2019s go one level deeper.Let\u2019s talk about WHY developers would want to spend their time building these tools.And here\u2019s where we go really deep down the rabbit hole, and see where Ethereum really shines.Still with me? I haven\u2019t even gotten to the core of my argument \u2014 we\u2019re just getting started.3. Ethereum does not sacrifice decentralizationWhen it comes to Blockchains, there\u2019s a fundamental law called The Scalability Trilemma. It\u2019s kind of like a law of physics that says a blockchain can only have 2 of these 3 properties: decentralization, scalability, and security.What that means is, given the same level of security, if you want to increase a blockchain\u2019s scalability, you must sacrifice its decentralization.Why is this true?Due to the nature of blockchains, every single validator needs to run every single computation that occurs on the network to ensure its accuracy.So if you want the network to be sufficiently decentralized by having thousands of users running validators, the max number of transactions per second needs to be capped by what the average user\u2019s PC and network speed can handle.On the other hand, if you wanted to have the fastest, most scalable blockchain EVER, you should do the following:Require that all validators be supercomputersHave as few validators as possible on the network, to decrease the number of connections per nodePut all the validators in the same geographical area (country, data center) to decrease latency between nodesCan you see why that would be a really bad idea for a blockchain?And yet every project I\u2019ve seen that boasts a very high number of transactions per second is quietly making this decentralization tradeoff \u2014 most of them are just not transparent about it to their users / investors.Why decentralization mattersThere\u2019s an excellent pair of blog posts from Chris Dixon and Spencer Bogart with the same title, \u201cWhy Decentralization Matters\u201d \u2014 both highly recommended reads.In his article, Chris Dixon makes a simple argument: Developers are a lot more incentivized to build on a platform that they know is NOT going to change the rules on them later down the line, taking away their audience and profits.If you build your application on Facebook or Apple\u2019s App Store, you have to trust that these platforms aren\u2019t going to ban you in the future, block certain users from using your app or seeing your updates, or start charging you higher fees to keep accessing the same audience.Ethereum, on the other hand, is what we call permissionless.Ethereum can be used by anyone for any purpose, without needing permission from anyone.NO ONE can stop you from uploading a piece of code into the Ethereum blockchain, and NO ONE can stop your users from executing it.Let that sink in for a minute, because it\u2019s extremely powerful.For the first time in history, we have a platform that that no one can shut down and no one can censor \u2014 not governments, not mega-corporations with tons of money, not the Rothschilds or Bogdanoffs or Reptilians or whatever conspiracy theory you subscribe to.If you build a DApp on Ethereum, no one can stop your users from anonymously accessing it.If you buy some tokens or digital items that are stored on the network, you are GUARANTEED they will stay there forever and no one will be able to take them away from you.And it\u2019s these permissionless and censorship-resistant properties of decentralized blockchains that have enabled us to have, for the first time in Internet history, true ownership of digital items.Yeah, I\u2019m talkin\u2019 about Ready Player One. With true ownership of digital items that cannot be taken away from you, blockchains enable us to do crazy new things in online games and virtual realities \u2014 like having virtual avatars that aren\u2019t owned by any company and can persist between worlds.More centralized platforms don\u2019t have this guaranteePretty much every platform that\u2019s been touted as the \u201cEthereum Killer\u201d has simply decided to trade off decentralization in favor of higher scalability, and advertise it as if it\u2019s a feature.And this tradeoff is tempting to make, because it seems like it\u2019s what the market wants.Users who don\u2019t know better complain about high fees and slow transaction times \u2014 so we can\u2019t really blame developers for trying to give the market what it thinks it wants.In Spencer Bogart\u2019s Why Decentralization Matters, he says:It\u2019s not surprising that new users and developers have gravitated toward these newer networks: Improved throughput and functionality are things that users and developers can immediately appreciate, whereas the benefits of \u201cdecentralization\u201d as a feature are seemingly amorphous.In the short term, users may be tempted by the performance offered by more scalable blockchains, not realizing the importance of decentralization until a wake-up call brings everything crashing down.He continues:The reality, however, is that without decentralization these crypto networks lose their most important qualities of being \u201cpermissionless\u201d and \u201ccensorship-resistant\u201d \u2014 that is, that anyone can use the network and anyone can build on top of them.After all, the entire point of a decentralized blockchain is to provide a hard-promise \u2014 an immutable ledger with open, non-discriminatory participation. In a sense, we bear the inefficiency of decentralization because it is the only way to enable a network with these qualities.Other blockchains that achieve 1,000 TPS or higher do so by having a small, fixed number of nodes that validate all the transactions \u2014 21 in the case of EOS, 101 in the case of Lisk.But a network run by 21 nodes requires that you trust these 21 publicly-identifiable nodes to not make changes to the protocol, or restrict certain people from using it for certain purposes in the future.It\u2019s a lot harder for a malicious entity to influence thousands of anonymous Ethereum nodes to censor certain transactions than it would be for them to gain influence over 15 out of 21 publicly-known block producers. Or for these 15 block producers to form a cartel and change the rules in ways that profit them, like what happens on centralized platforms. Or for a government or corporation to put pressure on these entities to censor certain transactions or users.As Spencer puts it:These semi-decentralized platforms are subject to the same social and economic pressures that motivate centralized platforms to censor certain users and activities, and therefore will trend toward the same outcome they\u2019re supposed to correct.If developers can\u2019t trust 100% that the base layer will always remain permissionless and censorship-resistant, then there\u2019s very little incentive for them to start building on the platform vs. simply using a traditional web server.By sacrificing base-layer decentralization in the nearsighted goal of attracting users by increasing throughput, these platforms have ironically undermined the entire motivation for using a blockchain in the first place.And on top of that, increasing throughput on Layer 1 isn\u2019t even a scalable approach.It will get you some initial gains, but it\u2019s fundamentally bottlenecked by the nature of blockchains and not the way to achieve true scalability.Which brings me to my next point\u20264. It will be impossible to run all the world\u2019s decentralized applications on a single blockchain: Scaling has to occur on Layer 2It would be absurd to try to run the Internet\u2019s 100 most popular games and social apps all on one giant supercomputer.Likewise, it\u2019s absurd to assume all the world\u2019s decentralized applications in the foreseeable future will run on one blockchain.Facebook alone needs hundreds of thousands of servers to function. Yet some people think a decentralized Facebook would share one massive blockchain with every other DApp in existence? \ud83e\udd14Let\u2019s look at some quick numbers.Facebook experiences 30,000+ Likes / Comments per second, the Nasdaq sees 20,000+ trades per second, and MMO games like PlayerUnknown\u2019s Battlegrounds handle over 1M concurrent users updating game state.It would only take a few dozen apps and games of this size before you\u2019re exceeding one million TPS in aggregate.And then what do you do when the number of users doubles?Clearly trying to run every single DApp on the same chain is not a practical approach.It doesn\u2019t matter if a blockchain can do a thousand transactions per second or a million transactions per second \u2014 no single blockchain will be fast enough to handle all the world\u2019s decentralized applications on the same chain.Scaling has to occur on Layer 2The solution is obvious \u2014 these applications will need to be split up across multiple blockchains.We realized this early on at Loom, when we presented the idea of application-specific sidechains. We foresaw that eventually some decentralized applications would grow popular enough to reach even 1/10th of Facebook\u2019s scale, and the only possible way to run them would be on their own dedicated chains.Of course, if you put these DApps that require thousands of transactions per second on their own standalone blockchains, they would be vulnerable to the same issues we discussed above in \u201cWhy Decentralization Matters.\u201dBut if you put them on a sidechain to a blockchain that is sufficiently decentralized (like Ethereum) \u2014 you get the best of both worlds.Sidechains provide higher scalability without sacrificing securityA sidechain can use a different consensus algorithm (like DPoS) optimized for DApps that require very high TPS or low-latency, while storing any tokens or data requiring a high level of security on the main chain.This way, even though the sidechain is less decentralized than the main chain, the amount of trust required by users is minimized, since they have the option to move anything of real value to the main chain for safe keeping. (Even more so if you secure the Layer 2 assets with Plasma Cash).By putting your DApp on a sidechain to a decentralized mainnet, you get all the benefits of higher scalability offered by a faster blockchain, while maintaining the same trust and security guarantees provided by the decentralized base layer.Spencer, in his article, arrives at the same conclusion we came to:The path forward: Highly decentralized base layer with increased centralization (and efficiency) on higher layersAnd in fact, this seems to be the same model envisioned by Vitalik Buterin himself:You could run StarCraft on the blockchain. Those kinds of things are possible. High level of security and scalability allows all these various other things to be built on top. Ethereum is a secure base layer that doesn\u2019t have too many features.~Vitalik ButerinEthereum provides a secure base layer for Layer 2 solutions to build on top ofNow we understand that:Scaling needs to happen on Layer 2The most important property of a Layer 1 is decentralizationSo the real question is, if not Ethereum, what base layer would you build your Layer 2 on top of?We\u2019ve already seen that very few chains do decentralization as well as Ethereum does.According to a recent ConsenSys report, there are \u201cjust under 17,000 nodes running the Ethereum blockchain across six continents, making it the most decentralized blockchain platform in existence.\u201dAnd any additional features another blockchain might offer, such as higher throughput, gas-less transactions, low-latency transactions, etc., can simply be implemented as Layer 2 services on Ethereum.In fact, those features are exactly what we\u2019re building at Loom Network with ZombieChain \u2014 a Layer 2, gas-free, low-latency DPoS sidechain to Ethereum.And that\u2019s just one of many Layer 2 scaling solutions under development.It\u2019s hard to fathom why a developer would want to replace Ethereum instead of simply building on top of it \ud83e\udd14Ignoring the obvious motivation that doing so allows them raise hundreds of millions of dollars in an ICO\u2026 \ud83d\ude09\u201cIt\u2019s like Ethereum\u2026 but BETTER.\u201dIt\u2019s kind of like reinventing the wheel.Sure, you might be able to build a slightly better base layer that still provides sufficient decentralization AND throws in some additional features.But then you\u2019d somehow need to convince all the developers to jump ship to use an untested platform \u2014 and in the meantime, Ethereum developers could take whatever good ideas you had, and implement them on a Layer 2 chain on top of Ethereum.It\u2019s also extremely risky.If a Layer 2 platform gets hacked or exploited, users\u2019 loss is minimized because the majority of tokens and data of value is still safely stored on the Layer 1 (Ethereum).But if you build a new Layer 1 blockchain that stores tokens that users pay real money for, the odds that your code will be exploit-free out the gate are slim \u2014 and in the case of an exploit, your users potentially have billions of dollars at stake.In programming circles, there\u2019s a rule that states \u201cDon\u2019t roll your own crypto.\u201dI\u2019m going to go ahead and predict that after we see the first major blockchain exploit in which millions or billions of dollars in token value evaporate into thin air, we\u2019ll start to hear a similar refrain among blockchain engineers:Don\u2019t roll your own Layer 1.Which brings me to my final point\u20265. New platforms are unproven, while Ethereum\u2018s security has already stood the test of timeAt the time of this writing, there\u2019s $61 billion in circulating ETH.That\u2019s a LOT of financial incentive for someone to try to hack / exploit the network.Thousands of aspiring h4x0rs over the past 3 years, trying and failing to find an exploit in EthereumAnd yet to this day, almost 3 years after Ethereum\u2019s mainnet launch, no one has managed to find an exploit in the platform\u2019s security.Note: Exploits have been found in individual smart contracts that developers have deployed to Ethereum, but I\u2019m talking about the core platform itself.The more time that passes without an exploit being found (despite a lot of people trying), the higher the likelihood that the platform is secure and won\u2019t ever be exploited in the future.This is similar to what Nassim Taleb called The Lindy Effect:The Lindy effect is a concept that the future life expectancy of some non-perishable things like a technology or an idea is proportional to their current age, so that every additional period of survival implies a longer remaining life expectancy.Basically, when a new blockchain platform springs up, developers will be reluctant to use it because it hasn\u2019t stood the test of time.What if it\u2019s exploitable? What if it\u2019s not truly decentralized? Why should I invest all my time building my DApp on top of it when I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019ll be around two years from now?The longer the chain survives without suffering a major exploit, the more trustworthy and legitimate it becomes in developers\u2019 eyes.Yet again, Ethereum has a massive head start here.For a new blockchain platform that launches today, it will take a few years before it has survived long enough for developers to view it as trustworthy.But in that same time, Ethereum will continue to race ahead in terms of developer adoption and supporting infrastructure. (Not to mention real, live DApps and end-users).Because Ethereum has such a long head start on all other smart contract platforms, it will always appear to be a better option from a security standpoint compared to a younger blockchain.Especially when, as we mentioned before, any new feature a new smart contract platform adds that might tempt developers away can simply be built on Layer 2 \u2014 and still keep the security promises of Ethereum.Conclusion: Ethereum isn\u2019t perfect \u2014 but at this point, it\u2019s hard to imagine it being displaced as the de facto Layer 1 for decentralized applicationsJavaScript isn\u2019t a perfect programming language, and for the longest time it was plagued with some pretty serious problems. But that didn\u2019t stop it from becoming the de facto programming language of Web 2.0.I predict we\u2019ve already reached the tipping point where we\u2019ll see the same thing happen with Ethereum for Web 3.0.For all its flaws and short-comings, it also has some of the smartest minds in the industry working on solving them \u2014 and building tools and infrastructure to make them less of a hindrance.And thus we come full circle to my developers argument. (Go ahead, you can watch that Steve Ballmer clip again. I won\u2019t tell anyone. \ud83d\ude09)It\u2019s possible that, in the future, another project will spring up that offers some significant advantages over Ethereum, and manage to get all the Ethereum developers to jump ship\u2026But I wouldn\u2019t bet my ERC20s on it.Loom Network is the blockchain platform of choice for serious dapp developers \u2014 the Universal Layer 2 that provides developers the tools they need to build functional user-facing dapps today.New to Loom?

In order to protect customer funds, we immediately paused interactions with the ETC blockchain.Updated Jan. 7, 2019\u201310:27pm PT: At time of writing, we have identified a total of 15 reorganizations, 12 of which contained double spends, totaling 219,500 ETC (~$1.1M). No Coinbase accounts have been impacted by the attack.Updated March 11, 2019\u201311:20am PT: We have now re-enabled sends and receives of ETC. Please note that transactions may take 24 hours, or longer, to be processed by the network due to the large number of confirmations required. Current ETC network status can be found here.Background InfoPage 3 of Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s whitepaper, Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System, states the following:\u201cIf a majority of CPU power is controlled by honest nodes, the honest chain will grow the fastest and outpace any competing chains.\u201dThe \u201chonest[y]\u201d of more than half of miners is a core requirement for the security of Bitcoin and any proof-of-work cryptocurrencies based on Bitcoin. Honest action, in this context, means following the behavior described in the Bitcoin white paper. This is sometimes described as a \u201csecurity risk\u201d or \u201cattack vector,\u201d but is more accurately described as a known limitation to the proof-of-work model.Failure to meet this requirement breaks several core guarantees of the Bitcoin protocol, including the irreversibility of transactions. Many other cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum Classic, have also adopted proof-of-work mining.The function of mining is to add transactions to the universal, shared transaction history, known as the blockchain. This is done by producing blocks, which are bundles of transactions, and defining the canonical history of transactions as the longest chain of blocks*. If a single miner has more resources than the entirety of the rest of the network, this miner could pick an arbitrary previous block from which to extend an alternative block history, eventually outpacing the block history produced by the rest of the network and defining a new canonical transaction history.This is called a \u201cchain reorganization,\u201d or \u201creorg\u201d for short. All reorgs have a \u201cdepth,\u201d which is the number of blocks that were replaced, and a \u201clength,\u201d which is the number of new blocks that did the replacing.This, on its own, might end up being nothing more than a minor inconvenience. After all, the transactions all still exist, but they might have been put into a different order, perhaps delaying some of them. However, imagine a miner who also owns a large number of coins. The miner could send those coins to a merchant in a transaction, T, while also secretly extending an alternative block history. The miner\u2019s secret blocks do not include T, but rather include a transaction that sends the same coins used in T to a different address. Call that transaction T\u2019. When the miner reveals this secret history, it will contain T\u2019, not T. Because T and T\u2019 attempted to send the same coins and T\u2019 is now in the canonical history, this means that T is forever invalid, and the recipient of the coins sent in transaction T never even received them in the new, now-canonical history. More info on this can be found here.What we observedUpdated Jan. 7, 10:27pm PT.We observed repeated deep reorganizations of the Ethereum Classic blockchain, most of which contained double spends. The total value of the double spends that we have observed thus far is 219,500 ETC (~$1.1M).Timeline of eventsLate on the evening of Saturday 1/5, our systems alerted us to a deep reorg in ETC that contained a double spend. Our on-call engineers responded to the alert and worked to confirm the report through the night. We determined that we would temporarily halt send/receive interaction with the ETC blockchain in order to safeguard customer funds.This meant that customers who tried to send or receive ETC on Coinbase Consumer or Pro were unable to complete their transactions.Customers who tried to send or receive ETC on Coinbase Consumer or Pro were unable to complete their transactions starting early Sunday morning, Pacific Time.On the morning of Sunday 1/6 we posted an update on status.coinbase.com stating (that) \u201cDue to unstable network conditions on the Ethereum Classic network, we have temporarily disabled all sends and receives for ETC. Buy and sell is not impacted. All other systems are operating normally.\u201dIn addition to in-platform notifications, we shared an update via status.coinbase.com.We performed an analysis on Sunday afternoon/evening to confirm the pattern and determine the key details of the double-spend attacks. Beginning Sunday afternoon, we observed 8 more incidents, all containing double spends.Out of an abundance of caution, we did not put up a blog post prior to legal and technical review. A false alarm could have inadvertently caused market instability.On Monday 1/7 morning after legal and technical review, we finalized our public analysis and posted to our blog and social media accounts.Note: A full blockchain analysis is beyond the scope of this article. Further research into the addresses sending the double spend transactions, the history of sends/receives from the addresses, the block fields such as timestamp, and the subsequent movement of miner rewards from attack blocks may shed light on the threat actor or actors behind these attacks.We observed the following deep chain reorgs:Common ancestor: 7245623. Depth 4 / Length 7. No double spends were observed in this reorg. We noted that this was a reorg of unusual depth for ETC.Common ancestor: 7248488. Depth 5 / Length 6. No double spends were observed in this reorg. We noted that a second reorg of unusual depth was highly suspicious, but did not necessary indicate an attack as there was no double spend and the depth was still below the ETC confirmation limit for most services.Common ancestor: 7249343.

We will be offering ETH/BTC and ETH/USD trading pairs on two new order books. In the meantime, you can now store your ether on Gemini in advance of trading next week, with all of the same industry leading security we already offer for bitcoin storage.When we began building Gemini almost two years ago, we envisioned a platform that would allow customers to trade digital assets in addition to bitcoin. Over the past six months, ether increasingly became a credible candidate for inclusion on Gemini. The Ethereum protocol\u2019s unique features and the wide range of applications being developed by the Ethereum community, along with increased liquidity and market cap, have made ether an obvious addition to the Gemini trading platform.We have been working closely with the New York State Department of Financial Services (\u201cNYSDFS\u201d) to obtain approval to offer ether storage and trading to our customers as a fully-licensed New York State-chartered limited liability trust company. Our approval makes Gemini the first licensed ether exchange in the world. It also makes the NYSDFS the first regulatory agency in the world to supervise ether, reaffirming their position as the leading financial regulator in the area of digital assets. Regulatory certainty and oversight are critical for both fostering innovation and protecting consumers \u2014 and we\u2019re excited to provide our customers with a safe, secure, and regulated place to buy, sell, and store ether.

Create your own CryptoUnlocked challenge to support a cause you care about or to raise funds for completing your passion project.I had been told that it would be unlike any coding job I\u2019d had before. But after two weeks working at AssuraCorp, it was obvious that something was truly different about the place. My co-workers seemed to scurry about without making any eye contact. The CEO would pace around the hallways with a half crazed look in his eyes, muttering one word orders to subordinates who would run away quickly. Above all else, there was a sense that nobody in the company had any passion for the work, which was rare in the world of Silicon Valley. Instead, everyone seemed to just be doing the job for the money.Don\u2019t get me wrong, I was working at AssuraCorp for the money too. My job paid twice what any other tech company paid to backend engineers, and the hours were flexible to boot. After working at three straight failed start-ups, I thought it was time I gave a big bureaucratic corporation a try, and the pay certainly didn\u2019t disappoint. But there definitely seemed like something was fishy with the company, behind all the posters of smiling employees underneath the words \u201cPledge to Be an AssuraCorp Soldier!\u201d It was like all of my co-workers were blindly signing on for some secret conspiracy that I knew nothing about.A few months\u2019 later, I got a Facebook friend request from a strange man named \u201cDorian,\u201d whose profile picture seemed to show a man in a trenchcoat with long unkempt hair and a patch over his right eye. He claimed to be a recruiter for a secretive technology company based on the Portuguese island of Madeira, close to the coast of Morocco. He asked if I was interested in joining the company, and claimed that the starting salary was over two million dollars a year. The whole situation smelled like a scam, but my curiosity was definitely piqued. I agreed to meet the man in a crowded whiskey bar in San Francisco the very next day; after all, what was the worst that could happen? At the very least, I would get an interesting story out of the experience, and on the small chance that the technology company was real, Madeira did look like a beautiful place to live, complete with beautiful beaches, gorgeous scenery, delicious red wine and Atlantic ocean waves that were just made for surfing.I met Dorian at the bar the next evening. He was sitting there, looking just like his profile picture, sipping on a glass of Japanese whiskey. He had a second glass already waiting for me. After some initial pleasantries, he revealed to me that his company was actually a secret group of blockchain activists known as \u201cThe Decentralized Division.\u201d They had been formed at the behest of Satoshi Nakamoto himself, who none of the members of the Decentralized Division had ever met. In fact, members of the Decentralized Division rarely met other members. Instead, they communicated using Telegram. Whenever it was necessary for them to coordinate, they would receive messages from Satoshi (who had proven his identity to them by signing a message). Then, the entire team would coordinate and take whatever action was necessary to achieve their goals.Dorian ordered another round of whiskey, and then another and another, and before long it felt like I had finished an entire bottle. My head was spinning and I had trouble figuring out if what Dorian said was true or not. He explained that the Decentralized Division was created to prevent unethical corporations from creating private blockchain ledgers that could be used to exert power and influence over other people. They recruited experts to the team who could help them in their missions: hackers, professional thieves, former spies and smugglers. Any attempt to create a centralized blockchain that could be used as an assertion of power over others would be subverted by the Decentralized Division, and Satoshi Nakamoto himself compensated the team members with Bitcoin for their services. More recently, some members had even received generous compensation in Ether from Vitalik Buterin himself, who believed very much in the team\u2019s mission.As drunk as I was, I still had trouble believing Dorian. \u201cHow about I prove it to you?\u201d he asked. \u201cHow about I have Satoshi Nakamoto himself sign a message to you later today. Or would you prefer a message from Vitalik Buterin?\u201d\u201cUm, sure, why not?\u201d I responded. \u201cHey\u2026 even if you do prove that everything you\u2019ve said is true, why would you tell me all of this? Why would you want me to know all of it?\u201d\u201cBecause I\u2019m inviting you to join the Decentralized Division,\u201d Dorian responded in his raspy half whispered voice. \u201cYour company, AssuraCorp, is developing a centralized blockchain that can act as a distributed computing platform and an operating system. They are essentially trying to push a centralized version of Ethereum. And they\u2019ve even developed a token for it, the SSuraCoin, which of course they will control. They plan on rolling out SSuraCoin in third world countries desperately in need of computing infrastructure, and in the process they will be able to control the technological destinies of millions of people. And the craziest thing is the big banks, people in the highest levels of government, they\u2019re all coordinating with AssuraCorp to create this. They call SSuraCoin the Ether-killer. They want to make the blockchain a permanently centralized entity which they can all exert control over. Instead of giving more people freedom, blockchain will be used to continue their enslavement. But we\u2019re not going to let that happen. The Decentralized Division was created just for situations like this.\u201dHe looks at me, and I stare dumbly and blankly back at him.\u201cHere, have another whiskey, it\u2019ll help you process all of this easier,\u201d he says, handing his full glass over to me. \u201cOf course, you would be very well compensated for your troubles. We would give you over ten million dollars worth of crypto, a mix of Bitcoin and Ether. You\u2019d be flown by private jet to our base of operations on Madeira island, where we would give you a new passport and new identity as an independently wealthy international playboy. After that, you will be able to enjoy life wherever you want, using your cryptocurrency wealth, until we need your skills again. Of course, if you help us again, we will make sure to compensate you with more crypto. And best of all, whenever you need additional financial help, the other members of the Decentralized Division will happily chip in funds that you can retrieve from the Trusted Lending Circle that we\u2019ve set up. Or you can even log into your CryptoUnlocked account and create a campaign in which you challenge yourself to tweet the hashtag \u201c#DecentralizeForever\u201d. Whenever other members of the Decentralized Division see you create the challenge and tweet out those words, they will immediately contribute to your campaign so you can have some extra funds.\u201d\u201cSo what do you need me to do?\u201d, I ask.He hands me an incredibly tiny, fully transparent USB stick. \u201cSomehow make your way into the office of the CEO of AssuraCorp, and plug this into his laptop tomorrow. He\u2019s been using Ether to pay developers all over the world to work on SSura coin. Based on transactions going to the wallet that we believe he controls, there must be close to fifty million dollars in his wallet. I\u2019m willing to bet he\u2019s the kind of man who secures his wallet with a keystore file and doesn\u2019t know any better. He\u2019s definitely not smart enough to use a cold storage. This USB stick has a virus, which will add additional garbage text to his keystore file. It will make the file virtually unusable. He won\u2019t be able to pay the devs he\u2019s contracted all over the world. I\u2019m betting that they will all become upset they aren\u2019t being paid, revolt against AssuraCorp, and sabotage the entire project.\u201d I look at him and let out a deep sigh. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 not an easy task. He\u2019s a very private man.\u201dHe reaches across the bar, grabs a quarter full bottle of whiskey, and finishes it in one gulp. Then he reaches into his pocket and hands me another USB stick. \u201cThere\u2019s a million dollars worth of Bitcoin and Ether on there. You can go home and check. That\u2019s just an upfront payment. There\u2019s ten times that amount waiting for you in a cold storage in Madeira once you finish this job and become a member of the team.\u201dI drink a few more shots of whiskey, and bid Dorian an uncertain farewell. \u201cI believe in you, you can do this,\u201d he tells me. I go home in a state of shock and confusion, unsure of what I will do the next day.The next morning, I stared at myself in the mirror while brushing my teeth. Would I do what Dorian had asked? The USB stick had contained a small fortune in crypto, and I had personally received a message that had been signed by Satoshi Nakamoto. The Decentralized Division seemed legitimate. But would I be brave enough to go through with the plan? Wait, what plan? How would I possibly get into the CEO\u2019s office without being detected?But then I began thinking about my experiences with blockchain: how excited I had been by the promise of decentralized technology, how idealistic the entire blockchain community had been in the early days. It seemed like an unfortunate mix of scams, bad publicity, and attacks from established financial institutions had taken much of the lustre off this exciting technology. And now, AssuraCorp was trying to kill off blockchain\u2019s empowering potential for good. I felt sick and bitter as I thought about all of this. \u201cDorian is right,\u201d I thought to myself. \u201cI have to do something.\u201d A plan started forming in my mind.The day went on like any other, yet another mindless series of useless meetings and staid water cooler conversation. Then, at 4 pm, right after a few people had left work to pick up their kids from school, I pulled a fire alarm in the office. Flashing lights and blaring sirens rocket everyone in the office out of their seats and towards the emergency exits. I start to run out with them, but sneak into a janitor\u2019s closet at the edge of the second stairwell. Quickly, I change into my uniform, an old fireman\u2019s costume that I had worn on Halloween years before. \u201cI hope this works,\u201d I think to myself. Minutes later, I jump out of the closet and begin running up the stairs, back towards the office. Co-workers are running past me, but I keep my head tilted downwards, my helmet obscuring as much of my face as possible. In my hand, I hold a fireman\u2019s ax. When I reach the top floor, I immediately run towards the CEO\u2019s office. As expected, the door is locked. I take the axe and smash it onto the door, once, twice, three times. Finally, the door has cracked. I punch my way into the room and rush towards his laptop. In an instant, the tiny virtually invisible USB stick has been plugged into the laptop, and I am rushing out of the building.Two days later, I am again sipping whiskey with Dorian, this time in a beautiful villa on the island of Madeira. A beautiful expanse of cliffs and ocean peels out before us. The keys to a brand new bright red Lamborghini and a three thousand dollar bottle of Pappy Van Winkle whiskey, both gifts from Dorian, lie on the table between us.It turns out that Dorian was so confident that I would go through with the plan that he went so far as to take out short positions on AssuraCorp. When the public got word that there was a break-in at AssuraCorp, the company that prided itself on keeping everyone\u2019s data secure, their stock price tanked and Dorian made a fortune. Of course, he generously shared some of that fortune with me, along with the ten million in cryptocurrency he had promised me.\u201cCheers,\u201d he says as he raises a glass towards me. \u201cTo keeping the world safe from centralization.\u201dI look out towards the beautiful horizon before me, and once again I\u2019m mesmerized by the myriad ways in which blockchain can empower people all over the world. \u201cTo keeping the world safe from centralization!\u201d I shout into the sky.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Bitcoin", "Ethereum", "Wetrust", "Cryptocurrency"]}, {"title": "", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@rdmpage/hi-donald-the-iphylo-version-of-your-comment-seems-to-have-vanished-into-the-ether-a9bde6992634?source=search_post", "author_name": "Roderic Page", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@rdmpage", "publish_date": "2018-08-20", "last_modified_date": "2018-08-20", "readtime": "0.96", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "Hi all \u2014 I\u2019ve been out of access to the Internet over the last week, so I apologise for the late\u202652Donald HobernRoderic PageFollowAug 20, 2018 \u00b7 1 min readHi Donald, the iPhylo version of your comment seems to have vanished into the ether :(Although BioCoin is pitched at citizen science, I wonder if this is too narrow. We\u2019ve not made any significant progress in encouraging data cleaning in projects like GBIF, and there is still a lot of data that copuld be mobilised but incentives are few and resources are limited. So I\u2019d be interested in whether an approach like BioCoin could be useful here. You could have institutions posting bounties to have data cleaned, or have experts clean other data sets in order to gain tokens to help fund data mobilisation.I think the name \u201cBioCoin\u201d playing off BitCoin is a double-edged sword, it immediately teels people this is about cryptocurrency, but BitCoin comes with a lot of baggage that obscures the debate (e.g., the notion that vast CPU farms will be involved). I think better analogies would be Basic Attention Tokens https://basicattentiontoken.org or GitCoins https://gitcoin.co. The advantages of a token-based approach versus traditional currency could be explored further, especially in the context of \u201cmicro-payments\u201d, which in the past, at least, have been problematic for traditional currencies (given the transaction costs).But the real question is whether a market-based approach to data gathering and cleaning is feasible. I think this deserves to be explored.

In an article we wrote last year, we explained that, in order to transfer common crypto tokens, people also need to purchase another currency (called \u201cEther\u201d in Ethereum), not to mention all the processes they needed to wrestle with (register on exchanges, trade and withdraw, as well as understand the concept of tokens in general). But they just want to use one thing. This is one of the major reasons why tokens, as well as many other crypto coins, still haven\u2019t been that widely adopted.But today, we are announcing a top-notch feature of the DreamTeam Token, which makes it truly unique \u2014 delegated transactions. That means that DREAM token holders don\u2019t need any other currencies but DREAM to transfer DREAM tokens or even call other smart contracts in the Ethereum network. In other words, instead of paying fees in Ether, DREAM token holders can now pay fees directly in DREAM by using our delegated transactions widget. Try it yourself!Our delegated transactions engine doesn\u2019t sacrifice security. For instance, in order to transfer tokens and pay the transaction fee in tokens, a user has to sign a specific message as confirmation of their intention to transfer tokens. No one can create a valid signature but you, by using your wallet, hence your tokens are always safe.You can use the delegated transactions widget from any browser that supports the Metamask extension. Or, you can use your mobile wallet\u2019s embedded browser (Metamask, Trust, imToken, etc). Soon, we are going to open-source our back-end delegated transactions engine and post a technical article about it, which will effectively allow you to plug in other tokens that support delegated transactions as well.

There is a general positive view on current state and outlook of cryptocurrencies from the inside experts. Yes we might be in bit of a bubble, but we\u2019ve been going from bubble to bubble and its part of growing up \u2014 seemed to be the general consensus.2.

Collecting and displaying all of this data in a timely manner presented a colossal challenge for our engineering team\u2026\u2026a challenge they met with ferocious determination by developing innovative techniques and improving existing technologies, which ultimately resulted in blocks and transactions coming in up to 30 seconds faster than alternative explorers.\u201cWe use our own ranking algorithm against every search to show more meaningful data before others. Other explorers out there don\u2019t have anything like our real-time, relevant search results.It\u2019s one of my favorite features.\u201d\u2014 Brad Bayliss, Enjin Lead Systems EngineerEnjinX has been meticulously optimized for speed; search results are instant and viewable within milliseconds.Blockchain data is immediately collected, processed, and displayed, enabling you to check everything from the status of a transaction (pending, failed, success) to viewing new information about all Ethereum transactions, addresses, blocks, and tokens \u2014 in real time.Exploring Ethereum, Made SimpleEnjinX technology and user experience are in perfect synergy \u2014 resulting in simple yet highly visual search and easily understandable blockchain data.User experience is everything. Aside from scaling, it is the single most important issue that\u2019s preventing full-blown mainstream adoption of blockchain technology.As Ethereum blockchain data is mined and stored in blocks, visualization of that data becomes increasingly complex.Blockchain technology will never take its conquering steps toward mainstream adoption if everyday users don\u2019t have a simple way to access and understand fairly complicated blockchain information, which comes in a myriad of forms.EnjinX was forged at the intersection of pioneering technology and user-centric design \u2014 resulting in a simplified multi-tier navigation, real-time search results, and carefully structured data visualization.\u201cThe Ethereum blockchain provides overwhelming amounts of interesting data.To achieve harmony in design and create a human-first experience, it was important to balance the structure of navigation, simplicity, and purpose for every page and element.Every detail was meticulously analyzed and crafted together to achieve a perfectly responsive application, on all devices and browser sizes.Clean, essential design gives the user both visual peace and a pathway for quick data assimilation.\u201d\u2014 Maxim Blagov, Enjin CEO / Creative DirectorEthereum transaction data is presented in a clutter-free way, flawlessly designed by following ultra-modern UI/UX practices:Transactions: Easily search and view all transactions \u2014 pending, internal, and token.Addresses: Comfortably check your balance and tokens, and take a peek at other addresses.Blocks: See block miners, transactions, rewards, and other relevant data.Tokens: Explore over 1,000 ERC-20 tokens and rank them by name, market cap, price, daily volume, and change.Responsive Design: Optimized for Mobile DevicesExplore Ethereum blockchain \u2014 on the go.Desktop computers placed the Internet in our homes; smartphones put it in our pockets.Blockchain is a bleeding-edge technology, destined to radically transform everything from societies and industries to nation-states and the emerging global civilization.Taking this into account, the fact that existing Ethereum explorers are either poorly optimized for mobile devices (or not optimized at all) seems extremely counter-intuitive, absurd, and just plain\u2026Wrong.Online platforms like Reddit and social media networks are littered with countless demands for a modern, responsive Ethereum explorer, one made for a modern, 21st century human.EnjinX will finally fix this paradox: on smartphones and tablets, it essentially looks and feels like a native mobile app. The user interface automatically adjusts to screen width \u2014 all the way from widescreen, 4K resolution desktop monitors to smartphones and tablets of all sizes.Multi-Language, Local Currencies, Custom Themes.Search the blockchain in your language, select your local currency, and and choose a custom theme.EnjinX has been translated to over 15 languages, with more to come in the following weeks.We felt that being able to explore the Ethereum blockchain in your native language would provide a more enjoyable user experience, besides bringing the ability to easily search blockchain data to non-English speakers \u2014 something that is extremely important for the advancement of the Ethereum ecosystem as a whole.Accessibility is important, and so is customization \u2014 which is why you\u2019re able to pick your local (or any) currency, not just a few of the world\u2019s major ones like USD, Yen, and Euro.Pstt\u2026 We included an Easter Egg, matey.EnjinX features a main theme, with two additional options: Winter and Summer. Each theme includes a Day and Night variation, making it easy to customize EnjinX based on your personal preferences or the time of day.Join the EnjinX Launch GiveawayOver 15,000 ERC-1155 tokens backed by more than 200,000 ENJ.EnjinX Launch GiveawayTo celebrate the launch of EnjinX, we are giving away over fifteen thousand ERC-1155 tokens - backed by over 200,000\u2026gleam.ioWe\u2019re celebrating the launch of EnjinX with an Enjin Beam-powered giveaway, featuring everything from somewhat common frozen ENJ to epic Multiverse items and\u2026The first ever, extremely rare Tradesmith items, special-edition HODL tokens, as well as a single Ansible\u2014one of the first ever minted ERC-1155 tokens.

I also wrongly assumed that people would use common sense and that leading developers would speak out against this sort of practice. Quite the opposite it seems.Ethereum\u2019s sole use case at the moment is ICOs and token creation.What\u2019s driving the Ethereum price?Greed.Greed from speculators, investors and developers.Can you blame them?Speculators and investors: No.Developers: Absolutely.So let\u2019s think for a minute and think what determines the price? Supply + demand. Pretty straightforward.Supply:The tokens that are available on the market, right? But with every ICO there are more tokens that are being \u201clocked up.\u201d Obviously the projects will liquidate some, to get fiat to pay for development of their project, but they also see the rising price of Ethereum.So at that point greed takes over and they think, totally understandable, \u201cWe should probably just cash out what we really need and keep the rest in ETH, that\u2019s only going up anyway it seems.\u201dAnd obviously there are new coins being mined, but if you look at the amount of ETH these ICOs raise, at this point, it\u2019s just a drop in a bucket.Demand:You have the normal investors (who are already very late to the game at this point\u2026 as usual), but the buy pressure that these ICOs are creating is crazy and scary. Take TenX for example, it\u2019s an upcoming ICO at the end of the month. The cap is 200,000 ETH (at current ETH price of $370) that\u2019s $74,000,000 for a startup.Here\u2019s the best part: it\u2019s only 51% of the tokens. Effectively giving it an instant $150 million valuation (if it sells out, which it probably will).Another example is Bancor, a friend of mine runs a trading group, he collected 1,100+ BTC to put into Bancor.This needs to be converted into ETH before the sale starts. These are decent size players, but not even the big whales who participate in these ICOs.What will the price do next?It can go quite a bit higher, there are so many coins being taken off the market by these ICOs, that it can still continue for a while and everyone is seeing this and thinking: \u201cWhy aren\u2019t I doing an ICO.\u201d There are lots more coming.At one point it will crash, hard. What the trigger will be?Bug(s) in smart contracts.Major hack.Big ICO startup that fails/fucks up,Network split.Even something as silly as not having a decent ICO for a couple of weeks, which creates sell pressure from miners and ICO projects can cause a big crash.It\u2019s not a question of \u201cif\u201d, it\u2019s a question of \u201cwhen.\u201d That being said: Markets can remain irrational for quite a long time.Usually when a bubble like this pops we could easily see 70\u201380% loss of value (for reference: Bitcoin went from $1,200 to $170 after 2013\u20132014 bubble). This is however quite the unusual situation and I\u2019m not sure to what kind of bubble I can really compare it.I\u2019m sure most of you have seen \u201cWolf of Wall Street.\u201d Just re-watch this clip and see if you find any similarities with the current situation. (bonus clip)What I really find interesting is what the ICO startups will do, Bitcoin had hodlers and investors mainly, individuals who most of the time had a full-time job and didn\u2019t need to sell.With Ethereum there is this huge amount being held by companies who need to pay bills. Will they panic dump to secure a \u201chealthy\u201d amount of fiat funding, will they try to hold through a bear cycle?Taking responsibility.Everyone loves making money, you can\u2019t blame traders or investors from taking advantage of this hype. That would be silly. People will buy literally anything if they can make a quick buck out of it.The responsibility here is with the developers, Consensys and the Ethereum Foundation but they don\u2019t take responsibility since they\u2019re getting more money. This will end with the regulators stepping in.The reason why I say that it\u2019s with developers, Consensys and the Ethereum Foundation is simple:The developers of a project assign these crazy tokensale caps, more money than any startup would ever need.The Ethereum foundation members+ core developers use their own celeb status to actively promote these projects as advisors, for which they\u2019re compensated well, luring in people who have no clue what they\u2019re buying.Consensys promotes all of this since it\u2019s the marketing branch of Ethereum. The more fools that buy in, the better.Let me illustrate this with an example.Have you heard of primalbase? It\u2019s an ICO with a token for shared workspaces. Why would a shared workspace need its own token? It doesn\u2019t, it really really really doesn\u2019t.Let\u2019s take a look at the advisors:First thing that an advisor should\u2019ve said in this case was: \u201cDon\u2019t do it, it\u2019s stupid, it makes no sense.\u201d But well there we have Mr. Ethereum himself.We all know that Vitalik has a cult-like following with the Ethereum investors so it will be very easy for primalbase to launch their ICO and use Vitalik\u2019s face and name to get itself funded.This is just one example, if you go through all of these ICOs you find a lot of familiar names and faces.Nothings wrong with being an advisor, but when you\u2019re just sending people to the slaughterhouse\u2026The sad part is that a lot of people will lose a lot of money on this, some of them obviously more than they can afford to lose, that\u2019s how it always goes.The [damn] regulators will step in after this bubble pops and what scares me is the fact that it will damage all of crypto, including Bitcoin, not just Ethereum and its ICO\u2019s.But you\u2019re just an Ethereum hater.I\u2019ve heard all the accusations:I hate Ethereum because I\u2019m a Bitcoin Maximalist. I\u2019m not, I like other projects too, like Siacoin for example.I hate Ethereum because I missed out. I did miss out on the crowdsale, but I traded plenty of Ethereum and it\u2019s ICOs and made some nice profit.I hate Ethereum because I don\u2019t understand it. Really? Do you? The only smart contracts running on it are ICO token sales. Or contracts to buy ICO tokens the second they become available.I hate Ethereum because I\u2019m jealous of Vitalik. No, it\u2019s impressive what he did at his young age. At the same time I think he\u2019s largely responsible for this bubble and he has made a lot of mistakes. We all make mistakes, but bailing out your friends from the DAO while other hacks and losses aren\u2019t compensated or fixed just shows total lack of integrity. Or it\u2019s everything or it\u2019s nothing. And when it comes to immutability in crypto, it should be nothing.For the people that are scared that Ethereum will replace BitcoinEthereum is not a store of value.It isn\u2019t capped. Yes, I know they\u2019re planning to switch to PoS (which it already kind of is). Do you think they managed to create the first software implementation ever without any bugs? Doing such a major change on a (currently) $30 billion market is completely irresponsible, borderline insanity.Even if we assume that there are no bugs, what about the miners? The miners who bought their equipment to mine Ethereum, the miners that supported the network for years. \u201cBut they knew we were switching to PoS.\u201d Of course they knew, and do you think they\u2019ll just give up on such a profitable coin?Some might switch immediately to Zcash and Ethereum Classic but there will be another fork and we\u2019ll have ETHPoS and ETHPoW, with of course all the Ethereum tokens being on both chains.Even Ethereum developers think that his is a very likely scenario.Ethereum\u2019s fees are lower. They are, sometimes, by a bit. If you\u2019re trying to send something when no token sale is active obviously, else you have people spending $100's to get in on the token sale and clog up the network.Also doesn\u2019t apply when you send something from exchanges since for example with Poloniex it\u2019s about $1.9 vs $0.28 for Bitcoin. Oh and another exception is when you actually use it for smart contracts, which require more gas to process than a normal transactions from account A to account B.You know.. the actual reason why Ethereum was created.Ethereum is not decentralized.Bitcoin isn\u2019t as decentralized as it should be, we all know that, but compared to most other coins, Bitcoin is very decentralized.Vitalik has called himself a benevolent dictator in the past. He is the single point of failure in this project and if he gets compromised in any way that\u2019s the end.There is no way of knowing if this happens and since people blindly follow everything he says, he has the power to do anything. Satoshi was smart enough to remove himself from the Bitcoin project.Ethereum is not immutable.Don\u2019t have to spend much time on this: see DAO and split that lead to Ethereum and Ethereum Classic.Ethereum has the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance.But but but.. all those big banks use Ethereum. No, they don\u2019t. They use \u201can\u201d Ethereum, which is a (private) fork of Ethereum. By that definition 99% of all altcoins are using Bitcoin.Still a separate chain. The fact that we\u2019re talking about a private blockchain here actually makes altcoins more like Bitcoin than \u201can Ethereum\u201d that EEA uses like Ethereum.You can compare it to 2013\u20132014 when some companies started to get interested in blockchain vs Bitcoin, only difference here is that for Ethereum it\u2019s part of their marketing campaign to lure in potential investors.If you think I\u2019m just full of crap, which is fair, I am just some random popular guy on Twitter who has been around from before Ethereum.Have a look at what Vlad has to say about the current state of Ethereum here and here. Vlad Zamfir is probably the smartest guy on the Ethereum team, and I say this while I don\u2019t agree with him on many of his opinions, I do respect him.Conclusion:If you\u2019re an actual developer, be realistic and honest with your investors. Do you really ever need more than $5 mill? Finish a MVP first and then do a tokensale, if you really really need to do an ICO.Plenty of rich crypto investors and traders now that would love to be part of your project and who would be happy to just invest for equity. Yes, it will probably be less than what you can get in an ICO, but at least you didn\u2019t sell out and it shows you actually really care about your product/service/\u2026If you\u2019re a trader or investor, be realistic about the bubble. I know you hear this a 100 times when you\u2019re trading but: don\u2019t invest what you can\u2019t afford to lose.I have some Ethereum, not as a long term investment, but because the price is going up and I need it to invest in tokens which I can quickly flip as soon as they come on the market.That\u2019s just the type of market we\u2019re in.

You can access Part 2 and Part 3 here.In my previous post, I explained the high level architecture of Ethereum platform comparing it to a web application. As a developer, the best way to learn any new technology is by diving in and building toy applications. In this post, let\u2019s build a simple \u2018Hello World!\u2019 application which is a Voting application.The application is extremely simple, all it does is initialize a set of contestants, let anyone vote for the candidates and display the total votes received by each candidate. The goal is not to just code an application but to learn the process of compiling, deploying and interacting with it.I have deliberately avoided using any dapp frameworks to build this application because the frameworks abstract away lot of the details and you fail to understand the internals of the system. Also, when you do use a framework, you will have more appreciation for all the heavy lifting the framework does for you!In lot of ways, this article is a continuation of the previous post. If you are new to the world of Ethereum, I recommend reading it before continuing.The goal of this exercise is to:Set up the development environment.Learn the process of writing a contract, compiling it and deploying it in your development environment.Interact with the contract on the blockchain through a nodejs console.Interact with the contract through a simple web page to display the vote counts and vote for candidates through the page.The entire application set up and build was done on a fresh installation of ubuntu 16.04 xenial. I have set up and tested the application on macos as well.This is how I would visualize this application we are going to build.1. Setting up the development environmentInstead of developing the app against the live blockchain, we will use an in- memory blockchain (think of it as a blockchain simulator) called ganache. In Part 2 of the tutorial, we will interact with the real blockchain. Below are the steps to install ganache, web3js and start the test blockchain on a linux operating system. The exact same instructions work on macos as well. For windows, you can follow the instructions here (Thanks Prateesh!).mahesh@zastrin:~$ npm -v6.1.0mahesh@zastrin:~$ node -vv10.4.0mahesh@zastrin:~$ mkdir -p ethereum_voting_dapp/chapter1/mahesh@zastrin:~$ cd ethereum_voting_dapp/chapter1mahesh@zastrin:~/ethereum_voting_dapp/chapter1$ npm install ganache-cli web3@1.0.0-beta.37mahesh@zastrin:~/ethereum_voting_dapp/chapter1$ node_modules/.bin/ganache-cliThe output should look like belowGanache CLI v6.3.0 (ganache-core: 2.4.0)Available Accounts==================(0) 0x66d1dda957bc7a087324130c89547ce579cee563 (~100 ETH)(1) 0xf98e7d03f312c8329d01ef0642b74e77740cc203 (~100 ETH)(2) 0x71d4ee31cd935d17a2b00b7d8873651d6aefbf73 (~100 ETH)(3) 0x2fdaa99748e6224e03e3e5a1a9a89abd906df671 (~100 ETH)(4) 0xfb32d320a858747453ac1b4e23c849fecd6ebf33 (~100 ETH)(5) 0x2c00cd8a488a8ae569553dfe90bf90d65af97630 (~100 ETH)(6) 0xa4099d0d4a0e7ce5bf26c3f4078a001daf5cedff (~100 ETH)(7) 0xa53c14d56683bdc775c19540679b0809bbf95a2b (~100 ETH)(8) 0x3ba642d43a2a24a0160fa22c358cf697aa4a627f (~100 ETH)(9) 0x81c43af78fdb4a2c8078ec37875e9616e3c5a3e4 (~100 ETH)Private Keys==================(0) 0xee670c7915b5e73b6f5c82da3919701f19ed1f72a1d4f31007836930623f4a57(1) 0xf40063c41978799ff6fa4b85d678b0f42ed6c774c35fa883a289fdc7fa0b65cb(2) 0x5228a5e30d1be11885cd7d44d4a47b1dfa22db4033cd758a1c3677a3a0cb5383(3) 0x3520c609b830538bd8c5d05c8f53338322411deb477308c5543f20a420fea5ec(4) 0xa7728cbc1eee41d696cb1d252157fc66ab1726ff751f2132c387726b5c901c35(5) 0xe459627dc49d59da76c393b40c36c674c8307ec52c24794a33ddc773f3c229fc(6) 0xa65715e3bdc8236420491de88486ff301a19b624b006811a89742e74120eac50(7) 0xc95ab6498d506f45b4b8ab2b04967d51e05af41059334df91d63097cb3254a3b(8) 0xf0619031f2ba4319aae691ce34fe8cce136640fb715b70d5baa045c2d58f1b80(9) 0x39a85154d16a1eba4a9f8514f187bcb6c8b867b790035afa9f92bf2731aebc5bHD Wallet==================Mnemonic:      rather online beyond apology whale cheese game ankle together share potato leisureBase HD Path:  m/44'/60'/0'/0/{account_index}Notice that the ganache-cli creates 10 test accounts to play with automatically. These accounts come preloaded with 100 (fake) ethers.2. Simple voting contractWe are going to use the solidity programming language to write our contract. If you are familiar with object oriented programming, learning to write solidity contracts should be a breeze. We will write a contract (think of contract as a class in your favorite OOP language) called Voting with a constructor which initializes an array of candidates. We will write 2 methods, one to return the total votes a candidate has received and another method to increment vote count for a candidate.Note: The constructor is invoked once and only once when you deploy the contract to the blockchain. Unlike in the web world where every deploy of your code overwrites the old code, deployed code in the blockchain is immutable. i.e, If you update your contract and deploy again, the old contract will still be in the blockchain untouched along with all the data stored in it, the new deployment will create a new instance of the contract.Below is the voting contract code with inline comment explanation:Copy the above code to a file named Voting.sol in the ethereum_voting_dapp/chapter1 directory. Now let\u2019s compile the code and deploy it to ganache blockchain.To compile the solidity code, we will first install npm module called solc. Then use the compiler to compile the contractmahesh@zastrin:~/ethereum_voting_dapp/chapter1$ npm install solc@0.5.3mahesh@zastrin:~/ethereum_voting_dapp/chapter1$ node_modules/.bin/solcjs --bin --abi Voting.solmahesh@zastrin:~/ethereum_voting_dapp/chapter1$ lsVoting.sol              Voting_sol_Voting.abi   Voting_sol_Voting.binWhen you compile the code successfully using the command above, the compiler outputs 2 files that are important to understand:Voting_sol_Voting.bin: This is the bytecode you get when the source code in Voting.sol is compiled. This is the code which will be deployed to the blockchain.Voting_sol_Voting.abi: This is an interface or template of the contract (called abi) which tells the contract user what methods are available in the contract. Whenever you have to interact with the contract in the future, you will need this abi definition. You can read more details about ABI hereRemember from the previous article, web3js is a library which lets you interact with the blockchain through RPC. We will use that library to deploy our application and interact with it.First, run the \u2018node\u2019 command in your terminal to get in to the node console and initialize the web3 object. All the code snippets below need to be typed in the node console.mahesh@zastrin:~/ethereum_voting_dapp/chapter1$ node> Web3 = require('web3')> web3 = new Web3(\"http://localhost:8545\")To make sure web3 object is initialized and can communicate with the blockchain, let\u2019s query all the accounts in the blockchain. You should see a result like below:> web3.eth.getAccounts(console.log)['0x9c02f5c68e02390a3ab81f63341edc1ba5dbb39e','0x7d920be073e92a590dc47e4ccea2f28db3f218cc','0xf8a9c7c65c4d1c0c21b06c06ee5da80bd8f074a9','0x9d8ee8c3d4f8b1e08803da274bdaff80c2204fc6','0x26bb5d139aa7bdb1380af0e1e8f98147ef4c406a','0x622e557aad13c36459fac83240f25ae91882127c','0xbf8b1630d5640e272f33653e83092ce33d302fd2','0xe37a3157cb3081ea7a96ba9f9e942c72cf7ad87b','0x175dae81345f36775db285d368f0b1d49f61b2f8','0xc26bda5f3370bdd46e7c84bdb909aead4d8f35f3']To compile the contract, load the bytecode and abi from the file system in to a string like below> bytecode = fs.readFileSync('Voting_sol_Voting.bin').toString()> abi = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('Voting_sol_Voting.abi').toString())Let\u2019s now deploy the contract. You first create a contract object (deployedContract) which is used to deploy and initiate contracts in the blockchain.> deployedContract = new web3.eth.Contract(abi)> listOfCandidates = ['Rama', 'Nick', 'Jose']> deployedContract.deploy({  data: bytecode,  arguments: [listOfCandidates.map(name => web3.utils.asciiToHex(name))]}).send({  from: 'ENTER 1 OF 10 ACCOUNT ADDRESSES like 0xfb3....',  gas: 1500000,  gasPrice: web3.utils.toWei('0.00003', 'ether')}).then((newContractInstance) => {  deployedContract.options.address = newContractInstance.options.address  console.log(newContractInstance.options.address)});We use the web3 deploy function along with send to deploy the contract to the blockchain. Let\u2019s see what are all the arguments we pass to deploy and send functions:data: This is the compiled bytecode which we deploy to the blockchain.arguments: These are the arguments we pass to the constructor of the contract. In our case we pass an array of candidate names. Note that we have to explicitly convert string to bytes32, that\u2019s why we call web3.utils.asciiToHex on each candidate name (using map function).from: The blockchain has to keep track of who deployed the contract. In this case, we are just picking the first account we get back from calling web3.eth.getAccounts to be the owner of this contract (who will deploy it to the blockchain). Remember that web3.eth.getAccounts returns an array of 10 test accounts ganache created when we started the test blockchain. In the live blockchain, you can not just use any account. You have to own that account and unlock it before transacting. You are asked for a passphrase while creating an account and that is what you use to prove your ownership of that account. Ganache by default unlocks all the 10 accounts for convenience.gas: It costs money to interact with the blockchain. This money goes to miners who do all the work to include your code in the blockchain. You have to specify how much money you are willing to pay to get your code included in the blockchain and you do that by setting the value of \u2018gas\u2019. The ether balance in your \u2018from\u2019 account will be used to buy gas. The price of gas is set by the network.gasPrice: Each unit of gas has a price associated with it. That is set in the gasPrice field.We have now deployed the contract and have an instance of the contract (variable deployedContract above) which we can use to interact with the contract. There are hundreds of thousands of contracts deployed on the blockchain. So, how do you identify your contract in that blockchain? Answer: deployedContract.options.address. When you have to interact with your contract, you need this deployed address and abi definition we talked about earlier.3. Interact with the contract in the nodejs console> deployedContract.methods.totalVotesFor(web3.utils.asciiToHex('Rama')).call(console.log)> deployedContract.methods.voteForCandidate(web3.utils.asciiToHex('Rama')).send({from: 'YOUR ACCOUNT ADDRESS'}).then((f) => console.log(f))> deployedContract.methods.totalVotesFor(web3.utils.asciiToHex('Rama')).call(console.log)Try the above commands in your node console and you should see the vote count increment. Every time you vote for a candidate, you get back a transaction id: Example: \u20180xdedc7ae544c3dde74ab5a0b07422c5a51b5240603d31074f5b75c0ebc786bf53\u2019 above). This transaction id is the proof that this transaction occurred and you can refer back to this at any time in the future. This transaction is immutable. This immutability is one of the big advantages of blockchains such as Ethereum. In future tutorials, we will build applications leveraging this immutability.4. Webpage to connect to the blockchain and voteNow that most of the work is done, all we have to do now is create a simple html file with candidate names and invoke the voting commands (which we already tried and tested in the nodejs console) in a js file. Below you can find the html code and the js file. Drop both of them in the ethereum_voting_dapp/chapter1 directory and open the index.html in your browser.If you remember, we said earlier we will need the abi and the address to interact with any contract. You can see above in the index.js file how they are used to interact with the contract.open the index.html in your browser and you should see something like this.If you are able to enter the candidate name in the text box and vote and see the vote count increment, you have successfully created your first application! Congratulations! To summarize, you set up your dev environment, coded a simple contract, compiled and deployed the contract on the blockchain and interacted with it via nodejs console and then through a webpage. Now would be a good time to pat yourself on the back if you haven\u2019t already :)In part 2, we will deploy this contract to the public test network so the entire world can see it and vote for a candidate. We will also get more sophisticated and use the truffle framework for development (and not have to use the nodejs console to manage the entire process). Hope this tutorial helped you get a practical idea on how to get started with developing decentralized application on the Ethereum platform.As always thanks Raine Rupert Revere for corrections/edits of this post.If you run into issues getting the application working, feel free to DM me on twitter @zastrinlab or email mahesh@zastrin.com.If you liked this tutorial, you might like many more interesting real-world project based courses at www.zastrin.comIf you would like to get notified when I write more tutorials, you can subscribe here.", "responses": 219, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Blockchain", "Tutorial"]}, {"title": "Bitcoin, Ethereum, Blockchain, Tokens, ICOs: Why should anyone care?", "post_link": "https://medium.com/hackernoon/bitcoin-ethereum-blockchain-tokens-icos-why-should-anyone-care-890b868cec06?source=search_post", "author_name": "Preethi Kasireddy", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@preethikasireddy", "publish_date": "2017-07-05", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-21", "readtime": "28.4", "claps": 8296, "voters": 2330, "content": "Bitcoin, Ethereum, Blockchain, Tokens, ICOs: Why should anyone care?Preethi KasireddyFollowJul 5, 2017 \u00b7 29 min readSource: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxtB01iPK6wThe Crypto market is gaining lots of steam.  Gravity-defying price rallies\u2026Bitcoin Price Chart (1 year)Ethereum Price Chart (1 year)Top 8 Cryptocurrencies Price Chart (excluding Bitcoin & Ethereum)\u2026and multi-million dollar token sales are commonplace, as are front-page headlines from traditional news outlets discussing Ethereum, Bitcoin, ICOs, tokens, hard forks, and other technical topics.Even my 13-year-old brother has been calling me up asking for explanations!I\u2019ve been personally invested in this space for a while now \u2014 most recently as an engineer for Coinbase \u2014 but even I\u2019m surprised by how quickly the Crypto space has evolved in the past six months.  If you want to understand why crypto is getting the spotlight, you have to understand the behind-the-scenes catalysts driving the market. Right now, that catalyst is the \u201ctoken sale\u201d or \u201cInitial Coin Offering (ICO)\u201d phenomena.ICO vs IPO: The wild west of investmentWhat the heck is an ICO anyway?  You may have heard of an \u201cInitial Public Offering\u201d (IPO) \u2014 when a company goes public by selling some of its shares to institutional investors, who in turn sell to the general public on the securities exchange. The public gets excited about IPOs because they let anyone with a brokerage account purchase shares of companies like Snapchat.  Are ICOs the same thing? Yes and no. IPOs and ICOs are both used by companies to raise capital. The main (and really important) difference is regulation. IPOs are regulated by the SEC and have a set of legal requirements and a formal process for how they\u2019re carried out. ICOs are currently unregulated and more of a \u201cwild west\u201d practice.  Overall, there seems to be a lot of confusion and uncertainty when it comes to ICOs. Some argue that they have turned into a \u201cperverse and unsustainable Keynesian beauty contest.\u201d Supporters are optimistic and claim that it\u2019s a new form of Venture Capital.  With drastically opposing viewpoints like this dominating the conversation, most of us are left on the sidelines scratching our heads.Necessary background knowledgeYou can\u2019t understand ICOs without understanding the underlying digital asset sold in an ICO.  If you already know the basics of crypto, feel free to skip this section. For the rest of us\u2026 let\u2019s start from the top!The Cryptocurrency technology stackCryptocurrency technology stackBitcoinBitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that uses a peer-to-peer technology.  Peer-to-peer essentially means that there isn\u2019t a central authority issuing new money or tracking transactions. Instead, these operations are managed collectively by the network. The transactions happen between users directly and are recorded on the blockchain (more on that below).  The Internet is filled with great Bitcoin explainers, so I won\u2019t delve much farther down the rabbit hole in this post. Instead, here are some starting points to get you up to speed:Bitcoin Wiki, Wikipedia, What is Bitcoin, Bitcoin Magazine, Why Bitcoin matters.BlockchainA blockchain is a decentralized public database that keeps a permanent record of digital transactions.  In other words, it\u2019s a logfile storing an immutable record of all the digital transactions. This decentralized database is not controlled by a central administrator, but instead is a network of replicated databases (meaning each node in the network stores its own copy of the blockchain) that is shared and visible to anyone within network.  Every \u201cblock\u201d in this blockchain contains a record of recent transactions, a reference to the block that came immediately before it, and an answer to a difficult mathematical puzzle, among other things.A blockchain is collectively maintained by \u201cminers\u201d, who are members within the network that compete to validate Bitcoin transactions in each block by solving the complex algorithmic problem associated with the block.  They do this by buying or renting lots of computing power to run these complex algorithmic problems on. The incentive for them to use their computing power to verify transactions is that they are rewarded with Bitcoin if they solve the problem and validate a Bitcoin block.  The power of such a decentralized network is that economic value and governance are distributed among the network\u2019s stakeholders (i.e. miners and consumers) rather than concentrated in a single organization (e.g. banks, governments & accountants). Thanks to this setup, anyone can own and transfer assets digitally without the need for a third party.Blockchain technology isn\u2019t limited to Bitcoin. It can be used to create any other cryptocurrency, such as Ethereum and Litecoin, which utilize their own blockchains. You can read more about bitcoin and blockchain at Wikipedia or watch this great explainer video.Protocol layerNext, we have the protocol layer. In general, a protocol is the special set of rules that nodes in a network use when they transmit information. These rules specify the interactions between the communicating entities.One example of a protocol used in telecommunications is Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), which is a set of rules for exchanging messages at the information packet level on the internet. TCP guarantees that the data packets will be delivered and that they will be delivered in the same order in which they were sent. Another example of a protocol is Internet Protocol (IP), which is a set of rules to send and receive messages at the Internet address level \u2014 it essentially specifies the format of the data packets on the internet and the addressing scheme.TCP/IP ProtocolWhen discussing blockchains, the term \u201cprotocol\u201d refers to the \u201ccryptoeconomic rules\u201d that are enforced by a blockchain in order to maintain distributed consensus across the blockchain\u2019s peer-to-peer network.Cryptoeconomic rules are rules that govern a decentralized digital economy that:(i) uses public key cryptography for authentication(2) has economic incentives to ensure that the rules are followedFor example, in the case of Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain, it has financial incentives that are provided to the miners for validating every Bitcoin transaction and in turn, securing the network.What exactly are these financial incentives?TokensEnter tokens.The financial incentive for miners comes from the native token built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain \u2014 Bitcoin. The coin serves as a \u201ccarrot and stick\u201d \u2014 miners who use their computing power to validate transactions are rewarded with a certain amount of coin.In general, when you hear the term \u201ccryptocurrency tokens\u201d or simply \u201ctokens\u201d, they are referring to tokens such as Bitcoin that are built on top of a blockchain and represent a digital asset which you own and can transfer to someone else.There are various ways to create tokens on top of a blockchain. For example, the simplest tokens to understand are intrinsic tokens like Bitcoin, which is directly built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. Or you can choose to fork the Bitcoin blockchain and build tokens on top \u2014 some examples include ZCash, Litecoin, Monero, and others. Or you can build an entirely new blockchain technology and build a token on top of that \u2014 which is what Ethereum did. The token on top of Ethereum\u2019s blockchain is \u201cEther\u201d.  \u2026you can even build tokens on top of Ethereum\u2019s blockchain itself. Gnosis (GNO) and Augur (REP) are examples of this. Perhaps confusing since \u201cEther\u201d is the intrinsic token built on top of the Ethereum blockchain. I\u2019ll explain later in the post. For now, just accept the fact that it\u2019s possible to build other tokens besides the intrinsic token on the Ethereum Blockchain.There\u2019s a helpful analogy here with traditional currencies \u2014 you can think of tokens as the currency itself (e.g. USD, EUR, etc.) and the blockchain protocol as the monetary policy.  The main takeaway here is that every token is based on some underlying blockchain \u2014 whether it\u2019s Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain, Ethereum\u2019s blockchain, or some other forked/new blockchain.Regardless of the cryptocurrency in question, tokens are valuable because the blockchain provides a backbone for asset manipulation that is immutable, decentralized, and impossible to counterfeit.The application layerSo far, we\u2019ve learned about Bitcoin and the underlying blockchain that enables it. We\u2019ve also learned about the protocol that determines the rules of the blockchain, and the tokens built on top of it.Together, these technologies have made us rethink our definition of money as something that is digital, easily transferrable, secure, and decentralized.But the important part to realize is that money is just one application of the blockchain. Besides money, the reason so many of us in the crypto-world are nerding out about the blockchain is because it has revealed a potential future for (1) protocols and (2) applications in general.(1) ProtocolsThe ultimate dream of cryptocurrency developers is that we can take advantage of this blockchain technology to build new and improved communication protocols from the ground up. Protocols being developed for cryptocurrencies have the potential to solve problems with centralization that have plagued the Internet since the first dial-up modem whirred and beeped into action.  What are examples of such protocols?Well, they could include protocols for payments, identity, domain name systems, cloud computing, reputation systems, and much more. Many of these systems today are highly centralized (e.g. Stripe, Paypal, Google, Amazon) and there\u2019s no such thing as defaults or standards for these things on the Web.  Hence, in the long term, our hope is that the blockchain technology will enable decentralized, open, and secure protocols to be built with use cases far outside cryptocurrency.(2) ApplicationsBlockchain enables what we call \u201cdecentralized applications\u201d. Decentralized application, or \u201cdApp\u201d, is an application built on top of the blockchain. How does that work?Let\u2019s consider the Bitcoin blockchain as an example. Bitcoin uses a scripting system for transactions that occur on the Bitcoin blockchain. A script is a simple list of instructions. So the Bitcoin\u2019s scripting language enables us to write a script that is recorded with every transaction. The purpose of the script is to define the requirements the recipient must meet to gain access to the Bitcoins being transferred.For a typical Bitcoin transfer, the script will define what the spender must provide:a public key that, when hashed, matches the destination address included in the scripta signature to show evidence of the private key corresponding to the public key just providedBut the neat thing is that there\u2019s some flexibility in the parameters we can send with each transaction. For example, we can write a script that says \u201cthis transaction is only valid if it has two private keys\u201d. So essentially, this scripting language now lets us encode rules for how to move money, or more generally, any piece of information, around, without requiring us to trust some third party to follow a set of rules we care about. We simply trust the code and all is well.Because Bitcoin has this scripting language, it\u2019s possible to use this language to build certain types applications that transact on the blockchain. In other words, we can build applications that use Bitcoin transactions to communicate.For example, let\u2019s say we want to build a blockchain-based crowdfunding application. You might have a set of rules for how funds are transferred (or communicated) between one party to another which you encode in the scripting language. Then users of the application can run a crowdfunding event that is governed by the blockchain.This is the main idea behind dApps: a decentralized set of rules that define a specific application. This set of rules sits on a public and decentralized blockchain (instead of a central server owned by some large entity, such as Facebook or Amazon). This enables it to governed by autonomy and be resilient to censorship.\u201cWhere are the apps?\u201d dilemmaMany of us in the crypto world were under the impression that developers would immediately hop on the bandwagon and use Bitcoin\u2019s scripting language to build decentralized applications on top.  But fast forward eight years (Bitcoin was released in 2009), and Bitcoin has yet to become more than simply a store of value and a speculative investment. Sure, we\u2019ve seen a handful of wallets and exchanges built. (Coinbase, Kraken, Poloniex, and GDAX, to name a few.)  \u2026And of course, we can\u2019t forget Silk Road, the digital anonymous drug marketplace that processed over $1 billion in sales in 2.5 years and was shut down by law enforcement in late 2013.  In some ways, Bitcoin could be considered the first decentralized application since it runs on blockchain technology, is fully open-source, and runs without a central authority. But seriously, a lot of us are here still looking around and wondering, \u201cWhere are the killer apps?\u201d  Sadly, almost no one I know uses blockchain-based applications in their day to day. Here are some factors holding these applications back from popularity (note: these are my personal opinions):1. Lack of developer friendliness and toolingProgramming applications using Bitcoin\u2019s scripting language is not easy. Why?  For one, the scripting language is too limited. A scripting language is a programming language where you can write code to perform some actions. An example of a scripting language widely used on the web today is JavaScript.const greeting = (name) => \"Hello, \" + name + \"!\";const add = (a, b) => a + b;const subtract = (a, b) => a - bCompare this to Bitcoin\u2019s scripting language:OP_DUP OP_HASH160 62e907b15cbf27d5425399ebf6f0fb50ebb88f18 OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIGThe JavaScript on top reads pretty much like English. Bitcoin\u2019s scripting language, on the other hand, looks like machine code. Most developers are used to writing in expressive languages like JavaScript, Ruby or Python\u2026 not machine code. Bitcoin script is daunting for most developers.  Secondly, developer tooling and great documentation goes a long way in gaining adoption among developers. Take React, for example, which is one of the most popular front-end libraries today. One of the biggest reasons that React became so popular is because of how much effort the community has put into building a strong set of developer tools (e.g. IDEs, Babel, Webpack, boilerplates, Create React App, etc), documentation, and tutorials. Bitcoin\u2019s ecosystem, on the other hand, is the opposite of user-friendly. Lastly, Bitcoin\u2019s scripting language is not turing complete. A turing complete programming language is one that can be used to simulate any single-taped Turing machine. In other words, it can be used to solve any computation problem that a Turing machine can run given enough time and memory. (for more on this, read this Stackoverflow discussion). By not being turing complete, Bitcoin script restricts what you can do. Overall, Bitcoin\u2019s scripting language has historically been limited, difficult to use and lacked adequate tooling and documentation. As a result, it didn\u2019t encourage a developer community to form, which is the prerequisite to killer applications.2. Building a decentralized application with strong network effects isn\u2019t easyMany of the applications we use in our daily work (marketplaces, exchanges, social networks, etc) derive their value from their strong network effects. A network effect is when a product or service increases in value as more people use it.  A classic example is Facebook. Every new user connecting to other users on the platform non-linearly increases the number of connections. Similarly, Venmo is useless if you\u2019re the only person on the platform. For every new friend that joins, the value of the product goes up because you can now pay and/or receive payment from this friend. Network effects help build better products and services. However, building up this network is one of the hardest parts of building a successful product, classically known as the \u201cchicken and egg\u201d problem.  So even if a developer were to make the effort to build a decentralized crowdfunding platform on top of Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain, getting users on both side of the platform (i.e. investors and product-builders) is an incredibly hard challenge.  The blockchain provides the technological underpinnings to create decentralized applications, but it doesn\u2019t provide the framework or tools necessary to drive adoption of the network.3. Decentralization alone doesn\u2019t provide a 10x improvementWhen we talk about decentralized applications built on top of the blockchain, we might think of transaction-based platforms, such crowdfunding, remittances, payments, coupons, etc. It might be a neat technical feat to have a decentralized version of these types of services, but the reality is, we already have existing apps that work perfectly fine for each of these use cases.  For crowdfunding, we have Kickstarter. For remittances, we can use TransferWise. For payments, we can use Credit Cards, Paypal, Venmo, Square, etc.  Peter Thiel\u2019s 10x rule is important to think about when we\u2019re considering how to get users to substitute existing solutions with the new decentralized ones. As of now, it\u2019s unclear what dimension these 10x advantages come from, so far as users go.  Take WeiFund, for example, which is a decentralized crowdfunding platform. As a user, WeiFund's interface and user experience seems similar to conventional crowdfunding platforms such as Kickstarter or GoFundMe. The main differences seem to be that they claim to have lower costs and that they use smart contracts to run the crowdfunding, allowing for more complex agreements. Is this enough to get users to make the effort to switch over (especially when the costs aren't that much lower)? By no means do I believe that decentralized applications have no benefits. In fact, I foresee a future where applications are 10x more secure, 10x cheaper, 10x more efficient, or 10x more on some dimension than the current ones.  The point is that these benefits have not been proven yet, so there's little reason for users to consider using a decentralized application today.The rise of decentralized applications\u2026 maybe.Enter Ethereum.Ethereum is a cryptocurrency launched in 2015 and built from the ground up using its own blockchain technology. It was designed to be a more generalized protocol than Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain, with the explicit goal of doing more than just creating and recording transfers of a blockchain network\u2019s native tokens.As written in the Ethereum white paper:\u201cThe intent of Ethereum is to create an alternative protocol for building decentralized applications, providing a different set of tradeoffs that we believe will be very useful for a large class of decentralized applications, with particular emphasis on situations where rapid development time, security for small and rarely used applications, and the ability of different applications to very efficiently interact, are important. Ethereum does this by building what is essentially the ultimate abstract foundational layer: a blockchain with a built-in Turing-complete programming language, allowing anyone to write smart contracts and decentralized applications where they can create their own arbitrary rules for ownership, transaction formats and state transition functions.\u201dEthereumIn essence, Ethereum is simply a transaction-based state machine: we begin with a \u201cgenesis state\u201d and incrementally execute transactions to transform it into some final state. The final state is what we accept as the canonical version of the current state of the world of Ethereum.Ethereum transactionWhile Bitcoin is the intrinsic token for Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain, Ether is the intrinsic token for Ethereum\u2019s blockchain.Just like Bitcoin, the Ethereum blockchain contains a log of transaction-like events. Users send Ether to one another using the \u201clog,\u201d and miners are incentivized to verify and secure these transactions within the network.But it can also go way beyond that \u2014 the Ethereum blockchain can be filled with a wider variety of event information coming from any sort of computer program.Let\u2019s look at a few of the core concepts that underly the Ethereum blockchain to understand why this is possible:Ethereum basicsFirst is accounts. There are two types of accounts: Externally Owned Accounts and Contracts Accounts. Both account types have an Ether balance.The main distinction is that contract accounts have some piece of code associated with them, while externally owned accounts do not. Contract accounts, therefore, have the ability to perform any type of computation when its associated code is executed.Next we have what are known as transactions, which are cryptographically signed data packages that store a message to be sent from an externally owned account to another account on the blockchain. When a transaction is sent to a contract account, the code associated with the contract account is executed by the \u201cEthereum Virtual Machine (EVM)\u201d on each node (more on that below).Finally, there are messages. Messages allow contract accounts to call one another. When a contract account send a message to another contract account, the code associated with the account is activated. Essentially, a message is like a transaction, except it\u2019s produced by a contract account rather than an external account.Let\u2019s quickly explain the concept of the \u201cEthereum Virtual Machine (EVM)\u201d. Remember how we learned that the protocol for the Bitcoin blockchain determines how transactions on the network get verified? Well, in Ethereum\u2019s case, every node that is participating in the Ethereum network runs the EVM as part of this verification process.Source: Coinspace.ioLet\u2019s say we have a set of transactions that were started by some external accounts. These get accumulated into a block, and then the nodes in the Ethereum network go through the transactions listed in the block and run the code associated with these transactions within the EVM. It\u2019s important to note that every node in the network runs the code and stores the resulting values. As you might guess, this tends to be computationally very expensive. To compensate for this expense and incentivize the nodes (or miners) to run these computations, the miners specify a fee for running these transactions. This fee is referred to as \u201cgas\u201d (you can read more on gas here). This is similar to how fees work in Bitcoin, where any fees attached to a bitcoin transaction go to the miner who mined the block that included the transaction.Note: This is a very high level description of how the Ethereum blockchain works and it certainly skips a lot of details for purposes of brevity. I\u2019ll write more in-depth articles in the future.Lastly, we have Ethereum\u2019s programming language for writing executable distributed applications and contracts. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum\u2019s programming languages (Solidity which is similar to JavaScript , Serpent which is similar to Python) don\u2019t look like machine code. It has the expressive power and functionality of languages that programmers are accustomed to developing on, like JavaScript or Python. Moreover, it lets you do pretty much anything an advanced programming language would let you do. Hence, it is \u201cTuring complete\u201d.The key takeaway from all this is that Ethereum stepped into the crypto-world and provided us with a generalized framework for running any type of code on the blockchain more easily. Because Ethereum\u2019s language is turing complete, stateful, and developer friendly, the hope was to open up the benefits of the blockchain beyond just enforcing one particular ruleset (e.g. how digital money gets transferred) and enable a safe, open, highly available, autonomously governed, efficient, trustable and reliable mechanism to build any ruleset on top. This would enable developers to develop any type of application imaginable.An example of an application that is incredibly simple to build on Ethereum is a \u201csmart contract\u201d. A smart contract is a distributed contract that is represented in code and basically says \u201cif this happens then do that\u201d. They can accept and store Ether and data, and can send that Ether to other accounts or even other smart contracts. Just like regular contracts (e.g. a property lease or an employment agreement), they are used to form agreements with people or entities, but unlike regular contracts, they act like autonomous agents that run entirely on the blockchain and remove the human out of the loop, making them automated, open, secure and trustless.Another example of an application is a decentralized organization. A decentralized organization is a programmatic organization that runs based on rules encoded within smart contracts. So instead of the typical hierarchical structure of an organization that is managed by humans, a decentralized organization encodes all its rules into a smart contract and then is completely managed by a blockchain.Despite the fact that Ethereum has made it easy for us to now build applications on the blockchain, let\u2019s admit it, most of us, even including us crypto-nerds, are still living in a world where we don\u2019t use decentralized applications in our day to day.Why is that?  To explain, let\u2019s go back to my earlier hypothesis on why we ended up at the \u201cwhere are the apps\u201d problem, and see how Ethereum addresses each one.Problem #1: Lack of developer friendlinessAs we described above, Ethereum solves this problem by design through its expressive programming language and strong developer tooling.Problem #2: Building up network effects is hardWith or without Ethereum, seeding and spinning the network effects is still a huge roadblock. Replacing existing network businesses who\u2019ve built up huge networks effects is\u2026 as we said before, really HARD. If someone builds a decentralized Airbnb, they still need to convince both sides of the platform, the users and hosts, to come on board.Problem #3: Doesn\u2019t provide 10x improvementWe learned earlier that most users wouldn\u2019t be willing to switch to a decentralized platform unless it\u2019s 10x better than an existing solution on some dimension.Just because it\u2019s easier to build a decentralized application on Ethereum, doesn\u2019t mean it provides the 10x experience we\u2019re looking for. And so, the question we might ask is, are we still right back to square one? still stuck in the trenches?Well, not really.Because although Ethereum doesn\u2019t directly solve the network effects problem, nor the 10x problem, what it does do is enable the creation of a whole new set of applications that were never possible before. The clearest way to make a 10x improvement is to invent something completely new. I believe Ethereum makes inventing something completely new possible by making it easy to build smart contracts.The rise of protocols, tokens, and applicationsWhy the big deal about being able to build smart contracts?ProtocolsWell, the beauty of being able to easily build smart contracts on Ethereum is that it enables anyone to easily build a new protocol on top of Ethereum. Remember that a protocol is simply a set of rules that nodes in a network use when they to transmit information. Smart contracts allow us to do exactly this \u2014 create an automated trustworthy set of rules between two or more parties.Earlier, we mentioned how blockchain protocols have a intrinsic \u201ctoken\u201d associated with it, which is a digital asset that can be transferred between two users in the network without requiring the consent of a third party. In the case of Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain, the intrinsic token is Bitcoin and in the case of Ethereum\u2019s blockchain, the intrinsic token is Ether.But just because the Ethereum and Bitcoin blockchain protocols have intrinsic tokens associated with it to drive the network, doesn\u2019t mean a protocol built on Ethereum using a smart contract must have a token associated with it. Remember that the purpose of a protocol is simply to specify rules for communication between nodes.So essentially, there\u2019s two types of protocols:Ones which have a intrinsic token associated with it that help create economic incentives that drive a networkOnes which don\u2019t have a token that drives financial incentives and are simply used as a communication protocol between nodes (Note: these types of protocols CAN still have a token associated with it \u2014 e.g. to represent membership in the network, shares on an open market, etc. The difference is that they are not used to drive some economic incentive.)For lack of better names, I\u2019ll call the first kind \u201ccrypto-token-protocols\u201d and the second kind \u201ccrypto-protocols\u201d.TokensNow onto tokens.Just like Ethereum makes it possible to build new protocols on top of its blockchain, it also makes it possible to use smart contracts to build new tokens on top of its blockchain. Let\u2019s call these types of tokens \u201cnon-intrinsic tokens\u201d.In this regard, broadly speaking, we can think of a token system as just a database with one operation: subtract X units from A and give X units to B, under the condition that:  (i) A had at least X units before the transaction(ii) The transaction is approved by AEthereum makes it especially easy to implement such token systems. More specifically, ERC20 token interface provides a standardized way to develop a token that is compatible with the existing Ethereum ecosystem, such as development tools, wallets, and exchanges.What\u2019s more, these non-intrinsic tokens can exist as:Standalone tokens built on Ethereum (as shown in the above diagram)Be associated with any new underlying crypto-token-protocol built on EthereumBe associated with any new underlying crypto-protocol built on EthereumProtocols? Tokens? Protocols + Tokens? Why does this matter?  Let\u2019s take a look.Token sale (i.e. \u201cICO\u201d)Launching a new cryptocurrency blockchain is not easy \u2014 it requires a massive bootstrapping effort in order to assemble the resources needed to get it up and running. But in the case of Ethereum, its intrinsic tokens were used to spin up their blockchains \u2014 in order to kickstart a large network of developers, miners, investors, and other stakeholders, Ethereum created some Ether tokens and launched a presale of these tokens to the general public. It then used these funds to develop its blockchain.Ethereum was not the first to do this. In 2013, when Ripple started to develop it\u2019s Ripple payment system, it created around 100 billion XRP token, and sold these tokens to fund the development of the Ripple platform.This concept of fundraising via a token sale is sometimes referred to as an \u201cInitial Coin Offering\u201d, or ICO. But the structure of this token can vary significantly (as we just saw in the previous section), whereas the term \u201cICO\u201d makes it sound a lot more official and like an investment security, so let\u2019s stick to \u201ctoken sale\u201d.A token sale is when some party offers investors some units of a new cryptocurrency (i.e. token) for a certain price, that can then later be exchanged with other cryptocurrencies (i.e. tokens). The idea is that investors buy into these tokens, and the units of the token are fungible and transferable on cryptocurrency exchanges (e.g. Bitfinex, GDAX, Liqui, etc.) if there is demand for them.While most token sales in the past have been restricted to building a new cryptocurrency (e.g. Ethereum, Ripple, etc), the smart contracts of Ethereum are now enabling startups to also to use token sales to fund development of various protocols and applications built on top of existing blockchains.Before moving on, one important distinction to make is the difference between an application and protocol.Application vs. protocolAn application can be built on one or more protocols. One example is Augur, which is a decentralized prediction markets application that is built on top of two protocols:Decentralized oracle protocolExchange protocolThe decentralized oracle protocol is a \u201ccrypto-token-protocol\u201d that has financial incentives to drive the network to form consensus around the outcomes of real-world events using Augur\u2019s reputation tokens (REP). The exchange protocol, on the other hand, is a \u201ccrypto-protocol\u201d and does not have a token associated with it to drive financial incentives, but instead is a set of rules defined between buyers and sellers in order to move tokens between each other.But neither of these protocols need to be tied to a single application. Any application can in theory build on top of these underlying protocols.Token sales for protocols vs. applicationsEarlier, I mentioned how token sales can be used to drive development of a new protocol and/or to drive development of a new application.   So in essence, a team can use an token sale to fund:a blockchain (e.g. Ripple)a cryto-token-protocol built on top of an existing blockchaina crypto-protocol built on top of an existing blockchainan application built on top of a cryto-protocolan application built on top of a crypto-token-protocolan application built on top of crypto-protocol(s) and non-crypto-token-protocol(s)an applicationSo, pretty much anything :)The last one is interesting, because to do a token sale, the application doesn\u2019t even need to be built under a protocol. I can build non-profit organization and use tokens as a mechanism to fund the project. In this sense, a token sale simply becomes a new way to fund a traditional centralized application. A plain old crowdsale.Okay, so investors buy these tokens and then what happens?Depends. When a token is tied to a cryto-token-protocol, they look much more like intrinsic tokens like Ether and Bitcoin and are used to drive the development and network of a protocol. But when they are not, tokens simply represent something much more general. In fact, these tokens are flexible enough to represent a lot of different things.For instance, let\u2019s say I want to build a decentralized storage service. I can build a storage protocol using smart contracts which serve as agreements between a storage provider and their client, defining what data will be stored and at what price.I would then build a token for this protocol and do a token sale. If the protocol becomes widely used, then the protocol becomes more valuable, which in turn could increase the value of the token. Moreover, as a developer of this service, I could choose to make the tokens represent purchase rights to the services provided in the application.What\u2019s important to note is that, broadly speaking, the mechanism for creating tokens are so flexible that they can represent lots of different things:Paid credits/membership within the decentralized applicationEntitlement to a share of profits and/or losses, or assets and/or liabilitiesOwnership or equity interest in the protocol (or project)Voting power in the companyNo function other than mere existence \u2014 simply a digital asset that can be freely traded on cryptocurrency exchangesetc..There\u2019s a handful of projects which have successfully raise funds via a token sale, including as Augur, Antshares, Melonport, Gnosis, Antshare and many more. I\u2019d suggest you read their respective white papers if you want to learn more.Protocols, tokens, token sales, now what?We\u2019re at a point where Ethereum has made it easy to not only build protocols that can power decentralized applications, but also to help get a network off the ground. Ethereum does this in two ways: 1. MoneyThis one is obvious. As we already saw, a token sale now enables developers to easily release tradable tokens to raise funds for building a protocol and/or application. Using this money, the team could choose to invest in sales, marketing, etc. to drive the network.2. UsersThis is the more interesting piece of the puzzle. Protocols and decentralized applications can solve the network effects problem by using a token sale as a mechanism to get early contributors and adopters. Early adopters who believe in the protocol or application have an incentive to buy the token because there is potential for that token to be worth more in the future.So in essence, tokens could help bootstrap a network of early adopters because the incentives of the early adopters and the development team line up perfectly.Let\u2019s say you want to build a new file sharing protocol. You can launch a token sale through which you gain some early adopters, investors, and entrepreneurs who become interested in \u201cbuying in.\u201d They might be simply speculating or they might truly believe in the product. At that point, they become stakeholders in the protocol itself and are financially invested in its success. Then some of these early adopters either become users of the products built on top of the protocol or build products and services around the protocol themselves, with the incentive to drive the success of the protocol further in order to increase the value of their tokens. As the protocol gains adoption, it increases the value of the tokens, which further draws more attention from more investors, application builders and users, which leads to more applications, and so on.What Ethereum has done is create an incredibly flexible system to innovate at the protocol level and application level. We\u2019ll likely see a lot of experimental and innovative protocols and applications being built over the coming years. Many of these will fail, just like a lot of startups fail. But over time, it\u2019s likely that some core set of protocols and associated networks will successfully drive mainstream adoption.Finally, once the protocols begin to take shape and standardize, we\u2019ll see a whole host of decentralized applications being built on top.It\u2019s not a happy ending yetToken sales are providing the fuel needed to drive development of protocols built on top of the blockchain, and to further drive developer interest in building applications on top of these protocols.Of course, this isn\u2019t the perfect happy ending.For one, getting a bunch of early adopters isn\u2019t enough. You also need to work hard to sustain the growth of the network effects, just like traditional businesses do. That means putting in years of hard work to building a useful application and driving adoption.Secondly, another trend I\u2019ve noticed is that most of the token sales we are seeing today are being used to drive network effects around specific applications rather than open and decentralized protocols. Since tokens are so flexible, dApp developers are creating tokens that are coupled to the dApp, instead of a standardized underlying protocol that can be shared among applications. This could lead to fragmentation in protocols.Third, the initial growth of the token value is mostly driven by speculation (since it takes some time for the platform being built to become valuable). Hence, there will likely have high volatility. It\u2019s unclear if and how we can mitigate this, and if we can even figure out a mechanism to get token prices to stabilize over time. Overall, there\u2019s a lot of open questions around the viability of a token\u2019s value over time. Ideally, we want the token\u2019s value to be tied to the value of the protocol or application, similar to how a public company\u2019s stock is tied to the company that issued it, or to represent some valuable digital right to a service. But as of today, the value of these tokens is still mostly speculation.Fourth, the market for token sales incredibly frothy right now. Because securities regulations makes it difficult to sell tokens (which are unregistered securities) as equity (remember that a token can represent anything, including equity within the protocol or application), developers are not doing it. Instead, they are structuring them as crowdsales. While there are some highly respectable projects raising much needed capital in this manner without the hassle of regulation, there\u2019s a long tail projects that are simply taking advantage of the high demand in the ICO market to raise millions of dollars in capital with very little to show for it \u2014 some of which have even turned out to be outright scams that absconded with the funds collected during the process. We want these crowdsales to benefit the groups of people gathering together to build a common public good, but not the scammers. How do we achieve that?Besides these issues, there are still lots of unanswered questions that need to be figured out before token sales become a viable form of funding:What is the right design and structure for a token sale?In what cases does it make sense to structure tokens as an investment security? How should such token sales be regulated?What criteria should an individual investor use to evaluate token sales? (team, business model, etc)How is an investor guaranteed that the sale process in being managed in a safe and legal manner?Does there need to be a mechanism for distributing a portion of the liquidation value of the company among the token holders? Dividends?Can the token holders exercise control in the protocol or application via voting rights?How will the money be spent after the funds are raised?What metrics can an investor use to gauge trust that the team building the protocol or application will execute on the long-term plan and vision?Could it be more efficient to port the smart contracts of a token to use Ether directly, instead of creating a new token per protocol?What are the tax implications for the investor\u2019s gains or losses?If selling tokens become a new way to raise capital for startups, what happens to traditional Venture Capitalists?\u2026 and SO MUCH MOREIf these questions interest you, you\u2019re in luck \u2014 I\u2019ll write about some of them in upcoming posts!ConclusionI\u2019ve tried my best in this article to articulate my views on token sales and clear up some of the confusion around blockchain development in general.Talking about cryptocurrency and blockchain development is like trying to take a picture of a running cheetah.

Why is that?My theory has been that the scripting language in Bitcoin \u2014 the piece of every Bitcoin transaction that lets you run a little software program along with it \u2014 is too restrictive.Enter Ethereum. Ethereum has taken what was a four function calculator of a programming language in Bitcoin and turned it into a full fledged computer. We now stand only 9 months out from the beginning of the Ethereum network and the level of app development is already faster than Bitcoin\u2019s. We are finally getting rapid iteration at the app layer. In one early example, people have designed a decentralized organization (The DAO) \u2014 a company whose heart is code and peripheral operations are run by humans, rather than the other way around \u2014 that has raised $150m so far in the largest crowdfunding ever.To be clear, I don\u2019t think this needs to be a contest between Bitcoin vs. Ethereum and Coinbase plans to strongly support both. I think this is about advancing digital currency as much as we can. There is a significant amount of overlap between the two, however, so the comparison is valuable and the potential for competition is real.How did we get here?First, some history. When the Bitcoin white paper emerged in 2008 it was completely revolutionary. The amount of concepts that had to come together in just the right way \u2014 computer science, cryptography, and economic incentives \u2014 was astonishing. When the actual Bitcoin network launched in 2009, no one knew about it, and many of those who did thought it would surely fail. Just to make sure the thing worked, the scripting language in Bitcoin was intentionally extremely restrictive. \u201cScripting language\u201d is a fancy way of saying an easy to work with programming language (in fact, Bitcoin doesn\u2019t exactly have a scripting language, it uses a stack with script operators \u2014 more on that later). The scripting language in Bitcoin is important because it is what makes Bitcoin \u201cprogrammable money\u201d. Within each Bitcoin transaction is the ability to write a little program. For example, you can write a little program in a Bitcoin transaction that says \u201cthis transaction isn\u2019t valid unless it\u2019s June 15th, 2016 or later\u201d. This is very powerful because you can move money automatically with computer code and everyone can see the rules by which that money moves and know those rules will be followed.It was, and still is, incredible that Bitcoin got off the ground and is alive after 7 years. It is the first network ever to allow anyone in the world to access a fundamentally open financial system through free software. It has ~$7bn in market cap and has never had a systemic issue which could not be fixed. To some this is already a great success.However, we also stand here 7 years into Bitcoin with few apps and no \u201ckiller apps\u201d beyond store of value and speculation. The scripting language in Bitcoin has barely expanded and remains very restrictive. While Bitcoin has become embroiled in debate over the block size \u2014 an important topic for the health of the network, but not something that should halt progress in a young and rapidly developing field \u2014 Ethereum is charting new territory, both intellectually and executionally.Make no mistake \u2014 Ethereum would never have existed without Bitcoin as a forerunner. That said, I think Ethereum is ahead of Bitcoin in many ways and represents the bleeding edge of digital currency. I believe this for a few reasons:Ethereum\u2019s programming languages lets you do much more than Bitcoin\u2019sAs mentioned above, Bitcoin\u2019s scripting language is intentionally restrictive. You might liken it to programming with an advanced graphing calculator \u2014 functionality is limited. As a result, you can only do basic things. It is also hard to understand and use. Rather than most modern programming languages where the code is almost readable like a sentence, it looks like unintelligible machine code. As a result, it took Mike Hearn, a talented ex-Google developer, a whopping 8 months to write a first version of a fairly simple crowdfunding application.In contrast, Ethereum\u2019s programming languages (Solidity for those who like Javascript, Serpent for those who like Python) let you do pretty much anything an advanced programming language would let you do. This is why they are said to be \u201cTuring complete\u201d. Equally important, they are easy to use. It is simple for any developer to pick it up and quickly write their first app.Here\u2019s an example of a script in Bitcoin:OP_DUP OP_HASH160 62e907b15cbf27d5425399ebf6f0fb50ebb88f18 OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIGAnd one in Ethereum\u2019s Solidity:contract Simple {    function() {        var two = 1 + 1;    }}Developers at Coinbase have written simple Ethereum apps in a day or two.I cannot overemphasize enough how important this combination of full programming functionality and ease of use is. People are doing things in Ethereum that are not possible right now in Bitcoin. It has created a new generation of developers which never worked with Bitcoin but are interested in Ethereum.Bitcoin could have this advanced functionality, but it would be through a series of other layers that work with the Bitcoin protocol that haven\u2019t been created yet, while Ethereum is providing it out of the box.Beyond the radical difference in scripting languages, developer tools are much better in Ethereum. Bitcoin has never had a set of developer tools that caught on much, and they are sorely needed given it is much harder to work with Bitcoin out of the box. Ethereum has made life as a developer much easier. It has a welcoming homepage for devs and its own development environment (Mix IDE) amongst others.Ethereum has a more robust developer communityThe developer community in Bitcoin feels fairly dormant. Bitcoin never really made it past the stage of simple wallets and exchanges. The most notable thing to be released recently is an implementation of the Lightning Network (a way of making transactions, especially microtransactions, more efficient) called Thunder. This is an additional protocol layer, not an application, however, and could be used by both Bitcoin and Ethereum.In contrast, Ethereum\u2019s developer community feels vibrant and growing. Most importantly, entirely new things are being tried on Ethereum. While most are experiments or toys at the moment, you can see a list of apps that developers from around the world which is rapidly expanding.Developer mindshare is the most important thing to have in digital currency. The only reason these networks (Bitcoin, Ethereum) and their tokens (bitcoin, ether) have value is because there is a future expectation that people will want to acquire those tokens to use the network. And developers create the applications which drive that demand. Without a reason to use the network, both the network and its currency are worth nothing.Ethereum\u2019s core development team is healthy while Bitcoin\u2019s is dysfunctionalVitalik Buterin, the creator of Ethereum, has shown early promise as the leader of an open source project. He seems both comfortable as a community and technical leader. As an example, here\u2019s what he sent us when we added Ethereum to GDAX, our exchange.In contrast, Bitcoin has had a leadership vacuum since Gavin Andresen stepped aside after other core developers did not get on board with his (in my opinion rational and convincing) arguments to increase the block size. \u201cCore developers\u201d as they now stand are also relatively fragmented.Beyond a leadership vacuum, Bitcoin\u2019s \u201cleadership\u201d is less clear and toxic. Greg Maxwell, technical leader of Blockstream which employs a solid chunk of core developers, recently referred to other core developers who were working with miners on a block size compromise as \u201cwell meaning dips***s.\u201d A second discussion board needed to form on reddit, /r/btc, because of censorship on the original /r/bitcoin. The content on the Bitcoin discussion boards feels like squabbling while Ethereum\u2019s is talking about relevant issues and new ideas. In summary, Ethereum leadership (and as a result its community) is moving forward while things need to get worse before they can get better in Bitcoin.Ethereum has a growth mindset while Bitcoin has a false sense of accomplishmentThe general mindset of the two communities feels different as well. Many in Bitcoin seem to have a false sense of \u201cwe\u2019ve got this really valuable network we need to protect!\u201d. In my opinion that view is wrong and dangerous. Bitcoin is still orders of magnitude smaller than the major financial networks of the world at ~$200m/day in transaction volume (Visa $18 billion/day, SWIFT wire $5 trillion/day) and ~10 million users (5 billion in banks). And while transactions per day on Bitcoin seem to be increasing at a healthy pace, the actual $ volume of transactions on Bitcoin is not growing much.Bitcoin transaction volume in peak times compared to other networks \u2014 we\u2019ve got a long way to goMeanwhile, the core development team in Ethereum is focused. This is evident from the Ethereum blog. When I started reading it, it was everything I found myself thinking about for the present and future of Bitcoin but didn\u2019t see being discussed much: scaling the network, the viability of proof of stake, how to create a stable digital currency, what a blockchain based company (DAO) would look like, amongst other topics. These are very ambitious ideas and some won\u2019t work. But some probably will work, and they will be important \u2014 moving to proof of stake and eliminating physical mining being one of the most promising.Ethereum is making faster and more consistent technical progress on the core protocolIn Bitcoin, we have mostly been stuck on the block size debate for the last year and a half. Some minor improvements have been made (CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY to enable the time locking functionality mentioned earlier), and others are in development but not yet live (Segregated Witness to make the network more efficient). None of these changes have sparked much in the way of application development yet.Meanwhile, beyond the more robust programming language, Ethereum is making advancements that are core to even basic transactions. Its mining allows for much quicker blocks, and thus, transaction confirmation times \u2014 about 14 seconds on Ethereum compared to 10 minutes on Bitcoin (not an apples to apples comparison, but the larger point holds). This is largely due to the concept of miners getting paid for the work they put in whether or not they are the first to solve the next block (a system called \u201cuncle blocks\u201d). While this system isn\u2019t perfect yet, it\u2019s meaningful forward progress towards quicker transaction confirmations.Counterargument and caveatsEthereum is young and it\u2019s prudent to highlight the risks:Ethereum has been able to take more risk with new features because it is has had less to lose. Most of Ethereum\u2019s history has occurred while it has held in the hundreds of millions of dollars, while Bitcoin is in the billions. As Ethereum continues to grow, it may not be able to \u201cmove fast and break things\u201d in the same way. In practice I think this mostly comes down to the quality of the core development team \u2014 if they continue to make progress and build trust with the community execution can still be rapid, as shown by Linus Torvalds with Linux as an open source project.Ethereum hasn\u2019t gone through a governance crisis. Vitalik acknowledged this at an Ethereum meetup we hosted at Coinbase. Like any project that has success, it\u2019s inevitable to hit bumps as peoples\u2019 vested interests get bigger.Ethereum allows you to do more than you currently can in Bitcoin, and that brings increased regulatory risk. This is less of a systemic risk to Ethereum as a network, rather more of a risk to specific applications of Ethereum. A good example would be decentralized organizations (ex: the DAO) and regulation which would normally apply to a corporation.There is a greater security risk with Ethereum. Having a more robust programming language creates a greater surface area for things to go wrong. Bitcoin has been battle tested for 7 years. Ethereum has been live for 9 months and now stores about $1bn. While there hasn\u2019t been a major issue yet, it is possible there are issues people are not yet aware of. This probability goes down with each passing day. People will definitely create smart contracts with bugs in Ethereum. This won\u2019t be because of a failure of the core Ethereum protocol though, much like the failure of Mt. Gox was not an error in the Bitcoin protocol.Ethereum may attempt to move to proof of stake. This would be a huge breakthrough if it works as it would eliminate the need for proof of work and all of the hardware and electricity use that goes with it, but also presents a large risk. I believe this risk is manageable because there would be extensive testing beforehand.Scaling the network is harder when it supports mini programs in addition to basic transaction processing. This was the biggest question I had when I started to read about the idea in 2014. While there is no silver bullet here, I think some combination of solutions will be developed over time as they are with any evolving technology. Some possibilities for Ethereum are sharding the network, computing power and networks naturally getting faster over time, and the economics of the Ethereum blockchain only running the most important things as a forcing function. There is a decent argument (best articulated by Gavin Andresen in his article Bit-thereum) that it\u2019s better to keep the base transaction layer dumb for scaling reasons with advanced logic in higher layers. It\u2019s possible we come full circle and end up back there, but this isn\u2019t how interesting things are being created at the moment because it\u2019s harder to 1) create and 2) get decent adoption of multiple layers in the stack than it is to have it all out of the box in Ethereum.Wait \u2014 why is this a contest? Are Bitcoin and Ethereum competitors or complementary?This remains to be seen. It\u2019s possible Bitcoin remains the protocol that people are comfortable storing their value in because it is more stable and reliable. This would allow Ethereum to continue to take more risk by trying less tested advancements. In this scenario, Bitcoin is more of a settlement network while Ethereum is used to run decentralized applications (where most of the transaction volume occurs is up in the air). The two could be quite complementary.What is very real, though, is the possibility that Ethereum blows past Bitcoin entirely. There is nothing that Bitcoin can do which Ethereum can\u2019t. While Ethereum is less battle tested, it is moving faster, has better leadership, and has more developer mindshare. First mover advantage is challenging to overcome, but at current pace, it\u2019s conceivable.What does all this mean?It\u2019s all good news for digital currency. Ethereum is pushing the envelope and I am more excited than ever. Competition and new ideas create better outcomes for everyone. Even if Ethereum goes up in flames our collective knowledge in digital currency will have leveled up significantly. I have not given up on Bitcoin and it\u2019s hard to argue with a network that has been so resilient. I, and Coinbase, plan on supporting both. We\u2019ll probably support other things that haven\u2019t been invented yet in the future. At the end of the day, I have no allegiance to any particular network; I just want whatever brings the most benefit to the world.Taking a step back, it feels like the rate of change in digital currency is accelerating.Digital currency is a unique field because of how ambitious the scope is: creating a better transaction network for the entire world (for currency, assets, our online identities, and many other things). Like the Internet itself, this is not one company selling its own proprietary product, it is a series of low-level protocols that will connect everyone someday. And, like the Internet, it will (and has) taken longer to develop, but the impact will be immense.Fasten your seatbelts.", "responses": 62, "tags": ["Tech", "Bitcoin", "Blockchain"]}, {"title": "How to issue your own token on Ethereum in less than 20 minutes.", "post_link": "https://medium.com/bitfwd/how-to-issue-your-own-token-on-ethereum-in-less-than-20-minutes-ac1f8f022793?source=search_post", "author_name": "Moritz Neto", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@netomoritz", "publish_date": "2017-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2018-09-25", "readtime": "8.51", "claps": 20193, "voters": 1451, "content": "How to issue your own token on Ethereum in less than 20 minutes.Moritz NetoFollowDec 26, 2017 \u00b7 9 min readAlright bro, are you telling me that I can issue my own Token, make an ICO, get gazilions of dollars and live the crypto-dream in less than 20 minutes?The answer is yes, but hopefully you will do better than that.With the latest news about the Blockchain, Bitcoin, Ethereum, cryptocurrencies, and ICO popping up left, right and center, this Blockchain business is garnering quite a lot of attention. So I\u2019ve put together a tutorial so that you can understand the technology much better and you can become a part of the booming crypto-economy!This is the first of a series of tutorials to help people better understand how to leverage Blockchain technologies and crypto-currencies to build meaningful applications and nurture the network.In this tutorial my objective is to walk you through the steps of setting up your account through to issuing your first token on the Ethereum network using a single smart contract and MyEtherWallet.The token will be a standard ERC20, it will have the main functions and can be used as a general base for more sophisticated applications than just transferring them (many \u201chalf-serious\u201d ICOs have extremely similar contracts)WARNING: With great powers come great responsibilities. I\u2019m not responsible for you not being cautious with your ETH, or using these powers for the evil side of force. I truly hope you do good and feel empowered by the potential that this technology puts in the hands of people.Before we start:There are a few different components you will need in order to build your own token.Ethereum Address (Ropsten Network)Some Ethereum (Ropsten Network)A text editor (I.e. Sublime / Atom)Solidity contractEthereum addressFor this tutorial we will use a test network to issue the token so you don\u2019t end up spending real Ether\u2019s. We will use the Ropsten Test network.

On total supply there are actually a few considerations. First one is that the standard (and max) is 18 decimals, meaning that a coin can be splitted in 18 parts.The second one is that let\u2019s say for example you want to issue 100 tokens, on the total supply part you have to put 100 followed by the number of decimals that you choose.Ex: If I want to emit 100 tokens, what I will put on total supply is: 100000000000000000000; and so it goes.Lines 102\u2013105After that we are done with editing code.

In particular, late 2017 and early 2018 saw a massive increase in popular attention due to rapid price increases across the entire crypto-asset ecosystem. In two years, the word \u201cEthereum\u201d has been included in over 110 million Google searches. The hashtag #ethereum is tweeted, on average, 20,000 times a day.But what has this gradual and acute increase in attention meant for the Ethereum network as a whole? If we pull back the curtain of the much-discussed price of ether, what is happening on the Ethereum network? Let\u2019s take a look.Looking at the Figures: Blockchain ActivitySince its inception, the network has processed nearly 240 million transactions. At its height on January 4, the network processed 1.3 million transactions in 24 hours.The network is huge and distributed. To date, 35 million unique addresses exist on the Ethereum blockchain. On January 4, 2018, the number of active (i.e. transacting) addresses on Ethereum surpassed 1 million for the first time. On January 4, 2018 over 350,000 new addresses were created \u2014 the most addresses generated within a 24 hour period to date. Ethernodes reports just under 17,000 nodes running the Ethereum blockchain across six continents, making it the most decentralized blockchain platform in existence.Source: ethernodes.orgThe Ethereum blockchain is, without a doubt, the most active smart contract platform in existence. Of the top 100 tokens by market cap, 94% are built on top of Ethereum. Of the top 800 tokens, 87% are built on Ethereum. Most of these tokens are \u201cERC-20 tokens,\u201d which made possible the majority of the $5.5 billion raised through token sales in 2017 and the $6.5 billion raised in just the first quarter of this year.Behind the Blockchain: The Ethereum CommunityThe Ethereum developer community is estimated to be the largest in the world, at 250,000. In October 2017, Truffle \u2014 a development framework for Ethereum \u2014 surpassed 200,000 downloads. In less than a year, downloads are now at nearly 550,000. Github, which draws open-source developers from around the world, lists 14,000 repositories and 220,000 commits concerning Ethereum. MetaMask \u2014 a browser extension allowing users to to run dApps without running an entire Ethereum node \u2014 has reached over 1 million users.Beyond the decentralized network of Ethereum developers, organized consortiums have arisen to support and expand the Ethereum community. The Ethereum Enterprise Alliance (EEA) formed in March 2017 with 30 founding members committed to the integration of blockchain technology with enterprise establishments. Now, just over one year later, the EEA has grown to over 500 members. Startups, corporations, foundations, and organizations have all come together to contribute and benefit from the continued development of the Ethereum ecosystem.Welcoming Ethereum: Government AdoptionThough a long-discussed application of blockchain technology is the restructuring and even dissolving of traditional government, countries around the world have found ways to implement blockchain technology \u2014 specifically, Ethereum \u2014 to benefit their citizens. In the beginning of this year, the government of Brazil announced its intention to move petitions and popular voting onto Ethereum. Canada is testing out using Ethereum to provide transparency to the use of government grants to ease citizens\u2019 concerns of misappropriation and corruption. The city of Zug, Switzerland \u2014 a long-time crypto bastion \u2014 began offering digital IDs registered on Ethereum in 2017. Chile uses Ethereum to track the data and finances from the energy grid, hoping to combat corruption and exploitation through transparent, immutable data available for every citizen to see. Dubai is on the move to become an entirely integrated, blockchain-powered city by 2020. Estonia became the poster child of the distributed ecosystem and matured into a \u201cdigital republic\u201d by moving many of its national systems onto the Ethereum blockchain.Though blockchain technology has been cited as an opportunity to re-define the current global political structure with digital borders and citizenships, current systems are not wary of using its immutable, secure ledger to augment their services. We will continue to see government adoption of the Ethereum blockchain as its utility is proven in current examples.Building on Ethereum: Decentralized ApplicationsDecentralized Applications (dApps) are the primary selling point of the Ethereum blockchain. As an open-source, turing-complete, world computer, Ethereum can be leveraged by any developer to build her own series of smart contracts (i.e. a decentralized application). A site that tracks dApp development lists 1,552 launched dApps, though more are currently in development. DApps consist of everything ranging from prediction markets to gaming, and will continue to grow stronger as the network is improved upon.The Elephant in the Room: Scaling SolutionsScaling solutions for the Ethereum network are numerous, and are being worked on by multiple participants in the network. 2018 will be an exciting time for Ethereum, particularly with the projected testing of Proof of Stake through the rollout of the Casper protocol. Many active projects aim to provide layer 2 solutions, or \u201cinter-blockchain protocols.\u201d These initiatives tackle the \u201ctrilemma\u201d of achieving scalability, security, and decentralization on a blockchain. Cosmos is a permissionless network built for developers that allows blockchain interoperability and scaling. Loom Network has developed and launched a layer 2 platform on top of Ethereum, allowing gaming and social dApps to scale while still relying on Ethereum\u2019s core security and decentralization. The team has launched CryptoZombies, a live app enabling anyone to learn to code smart contracts on Ethereum (with over 200,000 students). OmiseGo allows users to send high-speed payment transactions between entities and across borders using plasma. Layer 2 scaling solutions, according to Vitalik Buterin, \u201ccan be built in such a way that they depend on the second level for performance, but not safety\u2026 They can then have the incentive of reputation and expected future revenue to drive them to perform well in the present, and the negative costs of any failure are mitigated.\u201dLooking Down the RoadWhat does this data mean? The Ethereum blockchain ecosystem is diverse, it is decentralized, it is strong, and it is flooded with innovation and activity. Since its launch in 2015, this rapidly-adopted and appreciated technology promises to solve issues plaguing almost every incumbent industry on earth. Across the world, developers, thinkers, innovators, leaders, and creatives are coming together to build a new way of communicating, transacting, and organizing. We\u2019re here for Web 3.0. We\u2019re here for a decentralized future. We\u2019re here for Ethereum.Zunaira Arshad, Everett Muzzy & Jeff Gillis, ConsenSysDisclaimer: The views expressed by the author above do not necessarily represent the views of Consensys AG.

Tools, wallets, applications and the ecosystem are still in development and it\u2019ll get easier!Part I is an overview of key terms and discusses Ethereum Clients and Smart Contract Languages.Part II discusses overall workflow and some current DApp Frameworks and Tools andPart III is the Programming Part, a quick walkthrough of writing tests and building a DApp for a smart contract using Truffle.Part I. IntroIf you\u2019re new to all this cryptocurrency stuff, including Bitcoin and how it works, check out the first couple chapters of Andreas Antonopoulos\u2019 Bitcoin Book to dip your toe in the water. Then head over to the Ethereum Whitepaper.If you start getting into some murky sections and would rather build something to get familiar first, then just read on. You don\u2019t have to understand all the crypto economic computer science to start building, and a lot of that paper is about Ethereum\u2019s improvements over Bitcoin\u2019s architecture.Starter TutorialsThe official place to start is ethereum.org which has a starter tutorial and follow-up token and crowdsale tutorials. There\u2019s also the official Solidity docs. Another good place to start with smart contracts (where I started) is dappsForBeginners, although it might be outdated.The goal of this write-up is to complement those tutorials and introduce some helpful dev tools that make starting out with Ethereum, smart contracts and building DApps (decentralized apps) easier. And to try to explain the overall flow of what\u2019s going on. This is from my (still-noob) perspective and with much help from the cool developers at ConsenSys.Basic ConceptsIt\u2019d be good to know some of these terms:Public Key Cryptography. Alice has a public key and private key. She can use her private key to create a digital signature, and Bob can use Alice\u2019s public key to verify that a signature is really from Alice\u2019s private key, i.e., really from Alice. When you create an Ethereum or Bitcoin wallet the long \u20180xdf\u20265f\u2019 address is a public key and the private key is stored somewhere. A Bitcoin wallet service like Coinbase stores your wallet\u2019s complementary private key for you, or you can store it yourself. If you lose your private key for a wallet with real funds you\u2019ll lose all your funds forever, so it\u2019s good to back up your keys. It hurts to learn this the hard way! I\u2019ve done it.Peer-to-Peer Networking. Like BitTorrent, all Ethereum nodes are peers in a distributed network, there\u2019s no centralized server. [In the future, there\u2019ll be hybrid semi-centralized services for Ethereum as a convenience to users and developers, more on that later.]Blockchain. Like a global ledger or simple database of all transactions, the entire history of all transactions on the network.Ethereum Virtual Machine. So you can write more powerful programs than on top of Bitcoin. It refers to the blockchain, what executes smart contracts, everything.Node. Using this to mean you can run a node and through it read and write to the Ethereum blockchain, i.e., use the Ethereum Virtual Machine. A full node has to download the entire blockchain. Light nodes are possible but in the works.Miner. A node on the network that mines, i.e., works to process blocks on the blockchain. You can see a partial list of live Ethereum miners here: stats.ethdev.com.Proof of Work. Miners compete to do some math problem. The first one to solve the problem (the next block on the Blockchain) wins a reward: some ether. Every node then updates to that new block. Every miner wants to win the next new block so are incentivized to keep up to date and have the one true blockchain everybody else has, so the network always achieves consensus. [Note: Ethereum is planning to move to a Proof of Stake system without miners eventually, but that\u2019s beyond noob scope.]Ether. Or ETH for short. It\u2019s a real digital currency you can buy and use! Here\u2019s a chart from one of several exchanges for it. At the time of writing, 1 ETH is worth about 65 cents in USD.Gas. Running and storing things on Ethereum costs small amounts of ether. Keeps things efficient.DApp. Decentralized App, what applications using smart contracts are called in the Ethereum community. The goal of a DApp is (well, should be) to have a nice UI to your smart contracts plus any extra niceties like IPFS (a neat way to store and serve stuff in a decentralized network, not made by Ethereum but a kindred spirit). While DApps can be run from a central server if that server can talk to an Ethereum node, they can also be run locally on top of any Ethereum node peer. [Take a minute: unlike normal webapps, DApps may not be served from a server. They may use the blockchain to submit transactions and retrieve data (important data!) rather than a central database. Instead of a typical user login system, users may be represented by a wallet addresses and keep any user data local. Many things can be architected differently from the current web.]For another noob angle on some of the concepts above here\u2019s a good read: Just Enough Bitcoin for Ethereum.Ethereum Clients, Smart Contract LanguagesYou don\u2019t have to run an Ethereum node to write and deploy smart contracts. See Browser-based IDEs and APIs below. But if you\u2019re learning, run an Ethereum node, it\u2019s good to get to know as a basic component and not hard to set up.Clients for Running an Ethereum NodeEthereum has several different client implementations (meaning ways to run a node to interact with the Ethereum network) including C++, Go, Python, Java, Haskell, etc. Why? Different strokes for different folks (like how the Haskell one is supposedly mathematically verifiable), and it improves the security and ecosystem of Ethereum to have so many. There\u2019s also a gui-based client in development, AlethZero.At the time of writing, I\u2019ve been using geth, the Go language one (go-ethereum) and on other days a tool called testrpc that uses the Python client, pyethereum. [Update: A new popular tool we use in lieu of testrpc now is ethersim that uses ethereumJS. EthereumJS is a JavaScript client that doesn\u2019t support real blockchain mining, so it\u2019s not a full client like the others listed above, but mining can be simulated for testing and development purposes.] The later examples will involve those tools.[Sidebar: I\u2019ve also tried the C++ one and still use its ethminer component for mining along with geth as the node, so different pieces can work together. Sidebar on Mining: Mining can be fun, sort of like having a houseplant you tend to, and another way to learn about the ecosystem\u2026 even if the price of ETH right now is not worth the local electricity costs of mining, that may change. Especially if everyone starts building cool DApps and Ethereum becomes more popular.]Interactive Console. Once you have a node using one of the clients, you can sync with the blockchain, create wallets and send and receive real ether. One way to do that with geth is through the JavaScript console. Another way is via JSON RPC (remote procedure calls) using a command like cURL for getting stuff via URLs. However the goal of this article is to walk you through a DApp development scenario so let\u2019s just move on. But these tools are good to remember for debugging, configuring nodes and using a wallet via command line.Running a node on a test network. If you install a client like geth and run it on the live network, it will take a while to download the entire blockchain and sync with the network. (You can check that it\u2019s synced by seeing that you have the latest block which is listed at the top of stats.ethdev.com and comparing that number to the block number output by your client node\u2019s logs.)However, to run smart contracts on the live network you\u2019d have to cough up some real ether. Instead, there are ways to run clients on a local testnet for free. They won\u2019t download the full blockchain and will create a private instance of the Ethereum network with its own blockchain, so are faster to use for development.testrpc. You can run a test network using geth, or another fast way of getting a testnet running is using testrpc. Testrpc will create a bunch of pre-funded accounts for you that will be listed when it starts up. It\u2019s is also super fast, so easier to develop and test with. You can start with testrpc, then when your contracts are in good shape, move to geth on a testnet, which can be started by specifying a networkid like: geth \u2014 networkid \u201c12345\u201d. Here\u2019s the testrpc repo but I\u2019ll review everything you need to install again in the tutorial part later. [Update: The developer of testrpc is now focusing on ethersim as a replacement for testrpc and I\u2019ll update this tutorial eventually to use ethersim too. You can start using it now in if you\u2019d like. Ethersim is based on ethereumJS and simulates mining for dev purposes and is very fast.]Let\u2019s talk about programming languages next, then we can dive into actually coding stuff.Programming Languages for Smart ContractsJust use Solidity. To write smart contracts there are a few different languages: Solidity, which is like JavaScript and has .sol as a file extension, Serpent, Python-like with extension .se, and a 3rd, LLL, based on Lisp. Serpent was popular a while back but Solidity is the most popular right now and more robust, so just use Solidity. You prefer Python? Use Solidity.solc Compiler. After writing a contract in Solidity, use solc to compile it. It\u2019s from the C++ libraries (different implementations complementing each other again) which can be installed here. [If you don\u2019t want to install solc you can also just use a browser-based compiler like the Solidity real-time compiler or Cosmo, but the programming part later on will assume you have solc installed.][Note: Ethereum\u2019s libraries are undergoing active development and sometimes things get out of sync with new versions. Make sure you have the latest dev version, or a stable version. Ask in one of the Ethereum Gitter\u2019s on Github or forums.ethereum.org what version people are using if things that used to work stop working.]web3.js API. Once a Solidity contract is compiled with solc and sent to the network, you can call it using the Ethereum web3.js JavaScript API and build web apps that interact with contracts. (No need to install this yet, read up on DApp Frameworks below first.)Those are the basic Ethereum tools for coding smart contracts and interacting with them to build DApps.Part II. DApp Frameworks, Tools and WorkflowDApp-building FrameworksYou can do all these steps with just the tools mentioned above, but some helpful devs have created DApp frameworks to make development easier.Truffle and Embark. The one that got me started is Truffle. (Before Truffle I watched a group of smart student interns last summer code stuff for a sleepless hackathon (albeit with terrific results) and shrank back in fear. Then Truffle came along and did a lot of the nitty gritty stuff for you, so you can start writing-compiling-deploying-testing-building DApps right away.) Another very similar framework for building and testing DApps is Embark. Between those two, I\u2019ve only used Truffle, but there are very successful DApp devs in both camps. [Update: Some other good dapp-building frameworks are Dapple and Populus. Dapple also just got a dev grant to be improved.]Meteor. Another stack a lot of DApp devs use include web3.js + Meteor which is a general webapp framework (The ethereum-meteor-wallet repo has a good starter example, and SilentCiero is building a lot of Meteor integrations with web3.js and DApp boilerplates). I\u2019ve downloaded and run cool DApps that do things this way. There\u2019ll be some interesting discussion of all of these tools and best practices for building DApps at Ethereum\u2019s \u00d0\u039eVCON1 conference Nov. 9\u201313th (which will also be streamed or on YouTube).APIs. BlockApps.net is creating a RESTful API for DApps based on a Haskell node they run as a centralized service to save you the trouble of running a local Ethereum node. This departs from the completely decentralized model of DApps but is useful when running an Ethereum node locally isn\u2019t realistic. For example if you want to serve your DApp to users who won\u2019t be running local nodes either and reach a wider audience with just a web browser or mobile device. BlockApps has a command line tool called bloc in the works that can be used after creating a developer account with them.If users have to run a local Ethereum node to use DApps isn\u2019t that a dealbreaker? Like BlockApps there are a range of tools in development so this won\u2019t be. Metamask lets you run Ethereum stuff in a browser without a node, Ethereum\u2019s AlethZero or AlethOne are easier-to-use GUI clients being developed and a LightWallet ConsenSys is building are ways to make interacting with DApps more painless. Light (SPV) nodes and sharding are also in the works or planned. It\u2019s a P2P ecosystem but can involve hybrid architectures.Smart Contract IDEsIDEs.There\u2019s a Mix IDE for writing contracts put out by Ethereum. Haven\u2019t tried it but will soon.Browser-based IDEs. The Solidity real-time compiler and Cosmo are both a fast way to get started compiling your smart contracts right away in a browser. You can even point your local node at these hosted instances by opening up a port (you should trust the site and not have your life savings in ether on your local node for that! See the Cosmo UI for instructions on how to do this with geth). But once your contract is working ok it\u2019s nice to use a framework for adding a UI and packaging it all up as a DApp, which is what Truffle does and will be explained in the programming part later.Another powerful enterprise-y browser IDE is in the works by Ether.Camp. Their IDE comes with a sandbox test network with an auto-generated GUI for testing (instead of writing tests manually as shown in the tutorial later) as well as a sandbox transaction explorer at test.ether.camp. When you\u2019re ready to deploy your contract for semi-real, using their testnet can be a good way to confirm your smart contract\u2019s working as expected on a closer-to-real testbed. The same explorer for the live Ethereum network is at frontier.ether.camp and it shows details about every transaction ever. Ether.Camp\u2019s IDE is invite-only for eager guinea pigs at time of writing but will be launched soon.Sample Contracts and DApps. Search Github for DApp repos and .sol files to see what cool stuff people do and how. A big list of DApps with repos is also here: dapps.ethercasts.com, although some of the list\u2019s details are a little out of date. Ether.fund/contracts also has some examples of Solidity and Serpent contracts people have written, but not sure if these have been tested or verified for correctness. There\u2019ll be a whole day of DApp presentations Thursday, Nov. 12th at \u00d0\u039eVCON1.Workflow for Deploying Smart ContractsThe workflow is:Start an Ethereum node (e.g. geth or testrpc or ethersim)Compile your Solidity smart contract using solc => get back the binaryDeploy your compiled contract to the network. (This step costs ether and signs the contract using your node\u2019s default wallet address, or you can specify another address.) => get back the contract\u2019s blockchain address and ABI (a JSON-ified representation of your compiled contract\u2019s variables, events and methods that you can call)Call stuff in the contract using web3.js\u2019s JavaScript API to interact with it (This step may cost ether depending on the type of invocation.)This workflow is depicted in greater detail in the diagram below:You could build a DApp that provides a UI for users to deploy a contract then use it (Steps 1 or 4). Or your DApp could assume the contract\u2019s already been deployed (common) and start the UI flow from there (Step 6).Part III. The Programming Part, FinallyTesting in TruffleTruffle is great for test-driven development of smart contracts which is highly recommended to maintain sanity when you\u2019re starting to learn how things work. It\u2019s also useful as a way to learn to write promises in JavaScript, i.e., deferred and asynchronous callbacks. Promises are like \u201cdo this, then when that comes back, do that, and when that comes back, do this other thing\u2026and don\u2019t keep us waiting while all that\u2019s going on, ok?\u201d Truffle uses a JS promises framework called Pudding on top of web3.js (so it installs web3.js for you too).Transaction times. Promises are extremely useful for DApps because transactions need to be mined into the blockchain (takes 12\u201315 seconds in Ethereum). Even if they don\u2019t seem to take that long on a test network it may take longer on the live network, or to find out it didn\u2019t happen (e.g. your transaction could have ran out of gas, or was mined into a block that\u2019s been orphaned).So let\u2019s copy a simple smart contract and write a test for it.Using TruffleMake sure you have 1. solc installed and 2. testrpc. (For testrpc you\u2019ll need Python and pip. If you\u2019re new to Python, to install it you may also need to use a virtualenv, a way to keep python libraries separate on a single computer.)Install 3. Truffle (You can do this using NodeJS\u2019s npm: npm install -g truffle, the -g may require sudo). To verify it installed, type truffle list in a console window to list all truffle commands. Then create a new project directory (I\u2019m naming my new directory \u2018conference\u2019), change into it, and do truffle init. This will create this directory structure:Now start a client node in a new console window by running testrpc (or start your geth node):Back in the first truffle console window, now type truffle deploy. This will deploy the Example contract truffle init created as boilerplate. Any errors messages you may have will show up in either the testrpc console window or the truffle window.As you\u2019re developing you can do truffle compile to make sure your contracts compile (using solc you can also run solc YourContract.sol), truffle deploy to compile and deploy it to the network, and truffle test to run your smart contract tests.First Contract, First TestHere\u2019s a Solidity contract for a Conference where registrants can buy tickets, and the organizer can set a maximum quota of attendees as well as provide refunds. All the code presented in this tutorial is in this repo.contract Conference {   address public organizer;  mapping (address => uint) public registrantsPaid;  uint public numRegistrants;  uint public quota;  // so you can log these events  event Deposit(address _from, uint _amount);   event Refund(address _to, uint _amount);  function Conference() { // Constructor    organizer = msg.sender;    quota = 500;    numRegistrants = 0;  }  function buyTicket() public returns (bool success) {     if (numRegistrants >= quota) { return false; } // see footnote     registrantsPaid[msg.sender] = msg.value;     numRegistrants++;     Deposit(msg.sender, msg.value);     return true;  }  function changeQuota(uint newquota) public {    if (msg.sender != organizer) { return; }    quota = newquota;  }  function refundTicket(address recipient, uint amount) public {    if (msg.sender != organizer) { return; }    if (registrantsPaid[recipient] == amount) {      address myAddress = this;      if (myAddress.balance >= amount) {        recipient.send(amount);        registrantsPaid[recipient] = 0;        numRegistrants--;        Refund(recipient, amount);      }     }  }  function destroy() { // so funds not locked in contract forever    if (msg.sender == organizer) {      suicide(organizer); // send funds to organizer    }  }}[Footnote: Currently if the quota is reached, buyTicket() keeps the money in the contract but the buyer won\u2019t get a ticket. So buyTicket() should use \u2018throw\u2019 to revert ticket buyer\u2019s transaction. I\u2019ll update the code and add a test for this soon. (Thanks to F.V. from the comments for catching this.)]Let\u2019s deploy this.[Note: At time of writing I have solc 0.1.3+ (installed via brew), Truffle v.0.2.3, testrpc v.0.1.18 (using a venv) on Mac OS X 10.10.5.]Deploying the ContractAdd a new smart contract. After you\u2019ve done truffle init, or in the existing project directory, copy-paste the Conference contract into contracts/Conference.sol. Then in the file config/app.json, edit the \u201cdeploy\u201d array to include \u201cConference\u201d.Start testrpc. Start testrpc in a separate console window using testrpc if its not already running.Compile or Deploy. Run truffle compile to see if the contract compiles, or just do truffle deploy to compile and deploy at once. This will add the deployed contract\u2019s address and ABI(that JSON-ified version of the compiled contract) to the config directory, which truffle test and truffle build will pull in from later on.Errors? Did that compile? Again, error messages may show up in either the testrpc console or the truffle console.Redeploy after restarting a node! If you stop your testrpc node, remember to redeploy any contracts using truffle deploy before trying to use them again. Each time testrpc restarts it\u2019s a blank slate.Analyzing the ContractLet\u2019s start with the variables at the top of the smart contract:  address public organizer;  mapping (address => uint) public registrantsPaid;  uint public numRegistrants;  uint public quota;address. The first variable is the wallet address of the organizer. This is set when the constructor is called in function Conference(). A lot of contracts will also call this the \u2018owner\u2019.uint. An unsigned integer. Space is important on the blockchain so keep things as small as possible.public. Means it can be called from outside the contract. A private modifier would mean it can only be called from within the contract (or by derived contracts). If you\u2019re trying to call a variable from a web3.js call in a test make sure its public.Mappings or Arrays. Before Solidity added support for arrays, mappings like mapping (address => uint) were used. This could also be written as address registrantsPaid[] but mappings have a smaller footprint. This mapping will be used to store how much each registrant (represented by their wallet address) has paid so they can get refunds later on.More on addresses. Your client node (i.e., testrpc or geth in these examples) can have one or more accounts. In testrpc, on startup an array of 10 \u201cAvailable Addresses\u201d are displayed:The first one, accounts[0], is used by default for calling transactions if a different one is not specified.Organizer address vs. Contract address. Your deployed contract will have its own contract address (different from the organizer\u2019s address) on the blockchain. This address is accessible in a Solidity contract using this, as used inside the refundTicket function in the contract: address myAddress = this;Suicide, a good thing in Solidity. Funds sent to the contract are held in the contract itself. In the destroy function above funds are finally released to the organizer set in the constructor. suicide(organizer); does this. Without it, funds can end up locked in the contract forever (somebody on reddit lost some ether this way), so make sure to include that method if your contract collects funds!If you want to simulate another user or counterparty (e.g. simulate a buyer if you\u2019re a seller), you can use another address from the accounts array. To buy a ticket as a different user, say accounts[1], use it in the from field:conference.buyTicket({  from: accounts[1], value: some_ticket_price_integer });Some Function Calls can be Transactions. Function calls that change the state of the contract (modify values, add records, etc.) are transactions and have implicit sender and value. So inside curly braces { from: __, value: __ } can be specified in a web3.js function call to send funds to a transaction function from a wallet address. On the Solidity end, you can retrieve these values using msg.sender and msg.value, which are implicity in Solidty transaction functions:function buyTicket() public {   ...  registrantsPaid[msg.sender] = msg.value;  ...}Events. These are totally optional. Deposit and Send in the contract are events that can be logged in the Ethereum Virtual Machine logs. They don\u2019t actually do anything, but are good practice for keeping track that a transaction has happened.Okay, let\u2019s write a test for this smart contract to make sure it works.Writing a TestIn your project folder\u2019s test/ directory rename the example.js test file to conference.js. Modify all instances of \u201cExample\u201d to \u201cConference\u201d.contract('Conference', function(accounts) {  it(\"should assert true\", function(done) {    var conference = Conference.at(Conference.deployed_address);    assert.isTrue(true);    done(); // stops tests at this point  });});On running truffle test from the project\u2019s root directory you should see the test pass. In the test above truffle gets the contract\u2019s address on the blockchain from Conference.deployed_address.Let\u2019s write a test to initialize a new Conference and check that the initial variables are being set correctly. Replace the test in conference.js with this one:contract('Conference', function(accounts) {  it(\"Initial conference settings should match\", function(done) {    var conference = Conference.at(Conference.deployed_address);    // same as previous example up to here    Conference.new({ from: accounts[0] }).then(      function(conference) {       conference.quota.call().then(        function(quota) {          assert.equal(quota, 500, \"Quota doesn't match!\");        }).then(function() {          return conference.numRegistrants.call();        }).then( function(num) {          assert.equal(num, 0, \"Registrants should be zero!\");          return conference.organizer.call();        }).then( function(organizer) {          assert.equal(organizer, accounts[0], \"Owner doesn't match!\");          done(); // to stop these tests earlier, move this up        }).catch(done);    }).catch(done);  });});Constructor. Conference.new({ from: accounts[0] }) instantiates a new Conference by calling the contract\u2019s constructor. Since accounts[0] is used by default if no from is specified, so it could have been left out when calling the constructor:Conference.new({ from: accounts[0] }); // same as Conference.new();Promises. That\u2019s what those then and return\u2019s above are. What\u2019s going on above might start to look like a deeply nested function call chain like:conference.numRegistrants.call().then(  function(num) {    assert.equal(num, 0, \"Registrants should be zero!\");     conference.organizer.call().then(      function(organizer) {        assert.equal(organizer, accounts[0], \"Doesn't match!\");          }).then(            function(...))               }).then(                 function(...))                  // Because this would soon get hairy...Promises flatten this to minimize nesting, allow for calls to return asynchronously and help simplify the syntax of writing \u201con success do this\u201d vs. \u201con failure do that\u201d. Web3.js provides callbacks for asynchronous requests (docs) so you don\u2019t have to wait for transactions to complete to do stuff in the front-end. (Truffle uses a promises framework wrapper to web3.js called Pudding, based on the framework Bluebird, which also has advanced promise features.)call. Use this to check the values of variables as in conference.quota.call() or with an argument like call(0) to call a mapping and get index 0. Solidity docs say this is a \u201cmessage call\u201d which is 1. not mined and so 2. doesn\u2019t have to be from an account/wallet (therefore it\u2019s not signed with an account holder\u2019s private keys). Transactions on the other hand, are mined, have to be from an account (i.e., signed), and are recorded on the blockchain. Modifying any value in a contract is a transaction. Just checking a variable value is not. So don\u2019t forget to add call() when calling variables! Crazy things can happen. [Also, if you\u2019re trying to call a variable and having problems make sure its public.] call() can also be used to call functions that are not transactions. If they are meant to be transactions and you try to call() them, they won\u2019t execute as transactions on the blockchain.assert. Standard JS testing assertion (if you type \u2018asserts\u2019 plural by accident truffle will have errors and you won\u2019t know what\u2019s going on), see the Chai docs for other types of assertions but assert.equal is usually all you need.Run truffle test again to make sure that works for you.Writing a Test calling a Contract FunctionLet\u2019s test that the function that changes the quota works. Inside the contract(\u2018Conference\u2019, function(accounts) {\u2026}; body of tests/conference.js stick this additional test:it(\"Should update quota\", function(done) {  var c = Conference.at(Conference.deployed_address);  Conference.new({from: accounts[0] }).then(    function(conference) {    conference.quota.call().then(      function(quota) {        assert.equal(quota, 500, \"Quota doesn't match!\");      }).then(        function() {          return conference.changeQuota(300);      }).then(        function(result) {          console.log(result);           // printed will be a long hex, the transaction hash          return conference.quota.call();      }).then(        function(quota) {          assert.equal(quota, 300, \"New quota is not correct!\");          done();      }).catch(done);  }).catch(done);});The new thing is the line that calls the changeQuota function. The console.log is also useful for debugging to print the result in the truffle console\u2019s output. Add a console.log to see if the execution gets to a certain point. Also make sure the changeQuota function in the Solidity contract is public, or you won\u2019t be able to call it:function changeQuota(uint newquota) public { }Writing a Test for a TransactionLet\u2019s call a function that expects funds from a wallet address.Wei. Ether has a lot of denominations (here\u2019s a helpful converter) and the one normally used in contracts is Wei, the smallest. Web3.js provides convenience methods for converting ether to/from Wei, as in web3.toWei(.05, \u2018ether\u2019). JavaScript has issues with very big numbers so web3.js uses a BigNumber library and they recommend keeping things in Wei in your code until users see it (docs).Account Balances. Web3.js provides a lot more convenience methods here, and another one used in the test below is web3.eth.getBalance(some_address). Remember that funds sent to the contract are in the contract itself until suicide is called.Inside the contract(Conference, function(accounts) {\u2026}; body stick this additional test. In the highlighted method below, the test has a second user (accounts[1]) buy a ticket for ticketPrice. Then it checks that the contract\u2019s balance has increased by the ticketPrice sent and that the second user has been added to the list of registrants.In this test buyTicket is a Transaction:it(\"Should let you buy a ticket\", function(done) {  var c = Conference.at(Conference.deployed_address);  Conference.new({ from: accounts[0] }).then(    function(conference) {    var ticketPrice = web3.toWei(.05, 'ether');    var initialBalance = web3.eth.getBalance(conference.address).toNumber();    conference.buyTicket({ from: accounts[1], value: ticketPrice })      .then(        function() {         var newBalance = web3.eth.getBalance(conference.address).toNumber();         var difference = newBalance - initialBalance;         assert.equal(difference, ticketPrice, \"Difference should be what was sent\");         return conference.numRegistrants.call();      }).then(       function(num) {         assert.equal(num, 1, \"there should be 1 registrant\");          return conference.registrantsPaid.call(accounts[1]);      }).then(function(amount) {         assert.equal(amount.toNumber(), ticketPrice, \"Sender's paid but is not listed\");         done();      }).catch(done);   }).catch(done);});Transactions are Signed. Unlike previous function calls this is a transaction sent funds, so under the hood the second user (accounts[1]) is signing the transaction call buyTicket() with their key. (In geth the user would have to enter a password to approve this transaction or unlock their account before sending funds.)toNumber(). Sometimes results from Solidity returned have to be converted from hex. If it might be a really big number go with web3.toBigNumber(numberOrHexString) because Javascript can mess up big numbers.Writing a Test for a Contract Sending a TransactionFinally, for sanity, let\u2019s make sure the refundTicket method works and can only be activated by the organizer. Here\u2019s a test for it:it(\"Should issue a refund by owner only\", function(done) {  var c = Conference.at(Conference.deployed_address);  Conference.new({ from: accounts[0] }).then(    function(conference) {      var ticketPrice = web3.toWei(.05, 'ether');      var initialBalance = web3.eth.getBalance(conference.address).toNumber();      conference.buyTicket({         from: accounts[1], value: ticketPrice }).then(       function() {         var newBalance = web3.eth.getBalance(conference.address).toNumber();         var difference = newBalance - initialBalance;         assert.equal(difference, ticketPrice, \"Difference should be what was sent\");         // Now try to issue refund as second user - should fail         return conference.refundTicket(accounts[1], ticketPrice, {from: accounts[1]});       }).then(function() {       var balance = web3.eth.getBalance(conference.address).toNumber();       assert.equal(web3.toBigNumber(balance), ticketPrice, \"Balance should be unchanged\");       // Now try to issue refund as organizer/owner - should work       return conference.refundTicket(accounts[1], ticketPrice, {from: accounts[0]});     }).then( function() {       var postRefundBalance = web3.eth.getBalance(conference.address).toNumber();       assert.equal(postRefundBalance, initialBalance, \"Balance should be initial balance\");       done();     }).catch(done);  }).catch(done);});The corresponding Solidity function for the test above is here:function refundTicket(address recipient, uint amount) public returns (bool success) {  if (msg.sender != organizer) { return false; }  if (registrantsPaid[recipient] == amount) {    address myAddress = this;    if (myAddress.balance >= amount) {      recipient.send(amount);      Refund(recipient, amount);      registrantsPaid[recipient] = 0;      numRegistrants--;      return true;    }  }  return false;}Sending ether from a contract. The address myAddress = this; line shows how to get the conference instance\u2019s address, so you can check the balance in the subsequent line (or just use this.balance). Also the recipient.send(amount) method is where the contract sends funds back to recipient.Transactions cannot return results to web3.js. Note this! The refundTicket function returns a bool but this cannot be checked in your test. This method is a transaction (i.e., something that modifies values or send ether), and the result of a transaction to web3.js is a transaction hash (if you printed the result it\u2019ll be a long hex/weird-looking object). So why add a return value to the refundTicket call at all? The return value can be read in Solidity, such as by another contract that calls refundTicket(). So Solidity contracts can read return values from a transaction, but web3.js transaction calls cannot. On the other hand, other contracts can\u2019t use Events (discussed below) which is how you can monitor transactions in web3.js, or check whether a transaction has modified instance variables in a subsequent test promise using call().More on sendTransaction(). When you call a transaction like buyTicket() or refundTicket() using web3.js (which uses web3.eth.sendTransaction), the transaction does not execute right away. Instead the transaction is submitted to the network of miners, and the code does not run until one of those miners scores a block and the transaction is mined into the blockchain. So to verify a transaction you have to wait for it to make it onto the blockchain and then back to your local node. With testrpc this may be seem instantaneous because it\u2019s so fast but on a live network it will be slower.Events. Instead of using return values you can listen for events in web3.js. The smart contract example has these events:event Deposit(address _from, uint _amount);event Refund(address _to, uint _amount);And they are triggered in buyTicket() and refundTicket(). You can see these logged in the output of testrpc when called. To listen for them, you can also add web3.js listeners. At time of writing I haven\u2019t been able to log events inside of truffle tests but have logged them in an app:Conference.new({ from: accounts[0] }).then(  function(conference) {    var event = conference.allEvents().watch({}, '');    // or use conference.Deposit() or .Refund()    event.watch(function (error, result) {       if (error) {        console.log(\"Error: \" + error);      } else {        console.log(\"Event: \" + result.event);    }}); Filters. Instead of checking all events above which may lead to a lot of polling, filters could be used instead. They allow you to start and stop watching for them when your transactions are done. More on filters can be found in the Solidity docs.Overall, using events and filters are cheaper in terms of gas than checking variables so might be useful if you need to verify transactions on the live network.Gas. Up to this point we haven\u2019t needed to discuss gas at all, it usually doesn\u2019t need to be explicitly set with testrpc. As you move to geth and then the live network it will. In your transaction calls you can send gas implicitly inside the {from: __, value: __, gas: __} objects. Web3.js has a call for checking the gas price web3.eth.gasPrice (The result of this is not how much gas you should send with your transaction but the price of 1 unit of gas or step. For how much gas you should send for now its probably best to send something close to the gasLimit so its sure to run. Right now the maximum gas allowed in a block is 3141592. I just use 3000000). The Solidity compiler also has a flag you can call from the command line to get a summary of gas expenditures for your contract: solc \u2014 gas YourContract.sol. Here\u2019s the output for Conference.sol:Creating a DApp UI for your contractThis next section assumes you might be new to some web development practices, just in case.All the truffle tests written above are using JavaScript methods re-usable in a front-end UI. Add your UI to the truffle directory app/. On running truffle build it will be compiled along with contract configuration stuff to the build/ directory. When developing use truffle watch to constantly compile any changes in app/* to build/*. Then reload what\u2019s in the build/ directory in your browser. (truffle serve can also run a webserver for you from build/.)In the app/ directory there\u2019ll be some boilerplate started for you:index.html already loads app.js:So we can just add some code to app.js.app.js has a console.log with \u201cHello from Truffle!\u201d that will show up in your browser\u2019s developer console. Start truffle watch in the project root directory and then open build/index.html in a browser window, and open the browser\u2019s developer console (In a lot of browsers like Chrome, right-click \u00bb Inspect Element and switch to the Console tab below.)In app.js, add a window.onload function that\u2019ll be called when the page loads. This snippet below will confirm web3.js is loaded and show all the accounts available. [Note: your testrpc node should still be running.]window.onload = function() {  var accounts = web3.eth.accounts;  console.log(accounts);}See if that prints an array of accounts to your browser console.Now you can just copy some functions from tests/conference.js (remove the assertions since those are for testing), and output what\u2019s returned to the console to confirm its working. Here\u2019s an example:window.onload = function() {  var accounts = web3.eth.accounts;  var c = Conference.at(Conference.deployed_address);  Conference.new({ from: accounts[0] }).then(    function(conference) {      var ticketPrice = web3.toWei(.05, 'ether');      var initialBalance = web3.eth.getBalance(conference.address).toNumber();      console.log(\"The conference's initial balance is: \" + initialBalance);      conference.buyTicket({ from: accounts[1], value: ticketPrice }).then(        function() {          var newBalance = web3.eth.getBalance(conference.address).toNumber();          console.log(\"After someone bought a ticket it's: \" + newBalance);          return conference.refundTicket(accounts[1], ticketPrice, {from: accounts[0]});}).then(        function() {           var balance = web3.eth.getBalance(conference.address).toNumber();           console.log(\"After a refund it's: \" + balance); }); }); };The code above should output:Now using whatever web tools you prefer, jQuery, ReactJS, Meteor, Ember, AngularJS, etc., you can start building a DApp UI in app/for interacting with an Ethereum smart contract! Below is a super simple jQuery-based UI as an example.Here\u2019s the index.html. And here\u2019s the app.js.Now that I\u2019m interacting with the smart contract in a UI I\u2019m realizing it\u2019d be good to add checks to make sure the same user can\u2019t register twice. Also since this is running on testrpc, which is really fast, it\u2019d be good to switch to geth and make sure the transactions are still responsive to the user. Otherwise the UI should have some loading messages and disabled buttons while the transactions are being processed if they\u2019re going to take a while.Trying geth. If you\u2019re using geth, this line was working for me (geth v1.2.3):geth --rpc --rpcaddr=\"0.0.0.0\" --rpccorsdomain=\"*\" --mine --unlock='0 1' --verbosity=5 --maxpeers=0 --minerthreads='4' --networkid '12345' --genesis test-genesis.jsonThis unlocks two accounts, 0 and 1. Note:1. You may need to enter the passwords to both accounts after the geth console starts up.2. You will also need a test-genesis.json file with both of your accounts well-funded under \u2018alloc\u2019 in the test-genesis.json.)3. Finally, for geth you may need to add gas when calling the constructor:Conference.new({from: accounts[0], gas: 3141592})Then re-do the whole truffle deploy, truffle build thing.Code for this tutorial. Again, all the code presented in this tutorial is in this repo.Auto-generating UIs from contracts. SilentCicero has also built a tool called DApp Builder to auto-generate from a Solidity contract HTML, jQuery and web3.js calls you can modify. This is also starting to be a common theme of some other smart contract dev tools coming out.Ok tutorial over! This last part was a walkthrough of just one set of tools, mainly Truffle and testrpc. Even within ConsenSys, different developers use different tools and frameworks. You might find tools out there that are a better fit for you, and some things may change in a few months (Souptacular keeps an updated gitbook of resources and notes). But this workflow has helped me get started learning to build DApps.(\u2299\u03c9\u2299) wonk wonkThanks to Joseph Chow for a lot of proofreading and suggestions, as well as Christian Lundkvist, Daniel Novy, Jim Berry, Peter Borah and Tim Coulter for corrections and debugging help, and Tim Coulter, Nchinda Nchinda and Mike Goldin for helping with the DApp Front-end Steps diagram.by Eva ShonUX DesignerConsenSys", "responses": 43, "tags": ["Bitcoin", "Ethereum", "Blockchain"]}, {"title": "How to Code Your Own CryptoKitties-Style Game on Ethereum", "post_link": "https://medium.com/loom-network/how-to-code-your-own-cryptokitties-style-game-on-ethereum-7c8ac86a4eb3?source=search_post", "author_name": "James Martin Duffy", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@jamesmartinduffy", "publish_date": "2017-12-04", "last_modified_date": "2019-08-19", "readtime": "10.4", "claps": 11124, "voters": 1339, "content": "How to Code Your Own CryptoKitties-Style Game on EthereumJames Martin DuffyFollowDec 4, 2017 \u00b7 11 min readCryptoKitties has done a great job of demonstrating what blockchains can be used for beyond just simple financial transactions.I\u2019m hoping we\u2019ll start to see a lot more innovative uses of the blockchain for games like this in the future, so I wanted to write a quick walkthrough of the code behind CryptoKitties to show how it was implemented beneath the surface.This article is written for developers, and while it\u2019s not an absolute beginner\u2019s introduction to Solidity, I tried to include links to documentation to make it as accessible as possible to developers of all levels.Let\u2019s dive in\u2026CryptoKitties Source CodeAlmost all of the CryptoKitties code is open source, so the best way to figure out how it works is to read through the source code.It\u2019s around 2,000 lines in total, so in this article, I\u2019m going to be walking through only the sections I think are most important. But here\u2019s a copy of the full contract code on EthFiddle, if you want to read through it on your own:CryptoKitties Source CodePowered by EthFiddle, the #1 Solidity code-sharing siteethfiddle.comHigh Level OverviewIf you\u2019re not familiar with what CryptoKitties is, it\u2019s basically a game for buying, selling, and breeding digital cats. Each cat has a unique appearance that is defined by its genes, and when you breed 2 cats together, their genes combine in a unique way to produce an offspring, which you can then breed or sell.The code for CryptoKitties is split into a number of smaller contracts in order to keep related code bundled together without having one single giant file with everything in it.The subcontract inheritance for the main kitty contract looks like this:contract KittyAccessControlcontract KittyBase is KittyAccessControlcontract KittyOwnership is KittyBase, ERC721contract KittyBreeding is KittyOwnershipcontract KittyAuction is KittyBreedingcontract KittyMinting is KittyAuctioncontract KittyCore is KittyMintingSo KittyCore is ultimately the contract address the app points to, and it inherits all the data and methods from the previous contracts.Let\u2019s walk through these contracts one by one.1. KittyAccessControl: Who Controls the Contract?This contract manages the various addresses and constraints for operations that can be executed only by specific roles. Namely CEO, CFO, and COO.This contract is for management of the contract, and isn\u2019t related to the game mechanics at all. It basically has \u2018setter\u2019 methods for the \u201cCEO\u201d, \u201cCOO\u201d, and \u201cCFO\u201d, which are Ethereum addresses that have special ownership and control over particular functions of the contract.KittyAccessControl defines some function modifiers like onlyCEO (which restricts a function so that only the CEO can perform it), and adds methods to do things like pause / unpause the contract or withdraw funds:modifier onlyCLevel() {    require(        msg.sender == cooAddress ||        msg.sender == ceoAddress ||        msg.sender == cfoAddress    );    _;}//...some other stuff// Only the CEO, COO, and CFO can execute this function:function pause() external onlyCLevel whenNotPaused {    paused = true;}The pause() function was probably added so that the developers could update it with a newer version in case there were any unforeseen bugs\u2026 But as my colleague Luke pointed out, this would actually allow the developers to freeze the contract completely, making it so no one can transfer, sell, or breed their kitties! Not that they would ever want to do so \u2014 but it\u2019s interesting to point out, since most people assume that a DApp is totally decentralized just because it\u2019s on Ethereum.Moving on\u20262. KittyBase: What is a Kitty, Really?This is where we define the most fundamental code shared throughout the core functionality. This includes our main data storage, constants and data types, plus internal functions for managing these items.KittyBase defines a lot of the core data of the app. First, it defines a Kitty as a struct:struct Kitty {    uint256 genes;    uint64 birthTime;    uint64 cooldownEndBlock;    uint32 matronId;    uint32 sireId;    uint32 siringWithId;    uint16 cooldownIndex;    uint16 generation;}So a kitty is really just a bunch of unsigned integers\u2026 I guess.Breaking down each piece of this:genes \u2014 a 256 bit integer representing the cat\u2019s genetic code, the core piece of data that determines what a cat looks likebirthTime \u2014 a timestamp of the block when the cat was borncooldownEndBlock \u2014 the minimum timestamp after which this cat can engage in breeding againmatronId & sireId \u2014 the ID of the cat\u2019s mother and father, respectivelysiringWithId \u2014 this is set to the ID of the father if the cat is currently pregnant, zero otherwisecooldownIndex \u2014 the current cool down duration for this cat (how long the cat has to wait after breeding before it can breed again)generation \u2014 the \u201cgeneration number\u201d of this cat. The first cats minted by the contract have generation 0; the generation for new cats is the larger of their parents generations, plus 1.Note that in CryptoKitties, cats are asexual and any 2 cats are allowed to reproduce together \u2014 thus a cat does not have a gender.The KittyBase contract then goes on to declare an array of theseKitty structs:Kitty[] kitties;This array holds the data of all the Kitties in existence, so it\u2019s kind of like a master Kitty DB. Whenever a new cat is created, it is added to this array, with it\u2019s index in the array becoming the cat\u2019s ID, like Genesis here having an ID of \u20181\u2019:My array index is \u201c1\u201d!This contract also contains a mapping from the cat\u2019s ID to the address of its owner to keep track of who a kitty is owned by:mapping (uint256 => address) public kittyIndexToOwner;Some other mappings are also defined, but for the sake of keeping this article a reasonable length, I\u2019m not going to go over every detail.Whenever a kitty is transferred from one person to the next, this kittyIndexToOwner mapping is updated to reflect the new owner:Transfering ownership sets `kittyIndexToOwner` of the Kitty\u2019s ID to the recipient\u2019s `_to` address.Now let\u2019s look at what happens when a new kitty is created:So this function is passed the IDs of the mother and father, the kitty\u2019s generation number, the 256-bit genetic code, and the address of the owner. It then creates the kitty, pushes it to the master Kitty array, and then calls _transfer() to assign it to its new owner.Cool \u2014 so now we can see how CryptoKitties defines a kitty as a data type, how it stores all the kitties on the blockchain, and how it keeps track of who owns which kitties.3. KittyOwnership: Kitties as TokensThis provides the methods required for basic non-fungible token transactions, following the draft ERC721 spec.CryptoKitties conforms to the the ERC721 token spec, a non-fungible token type that lends itself really well to tracking ownership of digital collectables like digital playing cards or rare items in an MMORPG.Note on Fungibility: Ether is fungible, because any 5 ETH is just as good as any other 5 ETH. But with non-fungible tokens like CryptoKitties, not every cat is created equal, so they\u2019re not interchangeable with each other.You can see from its contract definition that KittyOwnership inherits from an ERC721 contract:contract KittyOwnership is KittyBase, ERC721 {And all ERC721 tokens follow the same standard, so the KittyOwnership contract fills in the implementation of the following functions:Since these methods are public, this provides a standard way for users to interact with CryptoKitties tokens in the same way they\u2019d interact with any other ERC721 token. You can transfer your tokens to someone else by interacting directly with the CryptoKitties contract on the Ethereum blockchain without having to go through their web interface, so in this sense you really own your kitties. (Unless the CEO pauses the contract \ud83d\ude09).I won\u2019t go over the implementation of all these methods, but you can check them out on EthFiddle (search for \u201cKittyOwnership\u201d).Intermission: Want to Build Your Own Ethereum Game?This article received a ton of positive feedback when it was first published, so we built CryptoZombies: an interactive tutorial for building your own games on Ethereum. It will walk you step by step through learning to code Solidity, and building your own Ethereum game. If you\u2019re enjoying the article, check it out!4. KittyBreeding: Cats Get Down and DirtyThis file contains the methods necessary to breed cats together, including keeping track of siring offers, and relies on an external genetic combination contract.The \u201cexternal genetic combination contract\u201d (geneScience) is stored in a separate contract, which is not open source.The KittyBreeding contract contains a method for the CEO to set the address of this external contract:They did it this way so the game would not be too easy \u2014 if you could just read how a kitty\u2019s DNA was determined, it would be a lot easier to know which cats to breed in order to get a \u201cfancy cat\u201d.This external geneScience contract is later used in the giveBirth() function (which we\u2019ll see in a bit) to determine the new cat\u2019s DNA.Now let\u2019s see what happens when two cats are bred together:So this function takes the ID of the mother and father, looks them up in the master kitties array, and sets the siringWithId on the mother to the father\u2019s ID. (When siringWithId is non-zero, it indicates that the mother is pregnant).It also executes triggerCooldown on both parents, which makes it so they can\u2019t breed again for a set amount of time.Next, we have a public giveBirth() function which creates a new cat:The in-line commenting on the code is pretty self-explanatory. Basically the code first performs some checks to see if the mother is ready to give birth. It then determines the child\u2019s genes using geneScience.mixGenes(), assigns ownership of the new kitty to the mother\u2019s owner, then calls the _createKitty() function we looked at in KittyBase.Note that the geneScience.mixGenes() function is a black box, since that contract is closed-source. So we don\u2019t actually know how the child\u2019s genes are determined, but we know it\u2019s some function of the mother\u2019s genes, the father\u2019s genes, and the mother\u2019s cooldownEndBlock.5. KittyAuctions: Buying, Selling, and Pimpin\u2019 of CatsHere we have the public methods for auctioning or bidding on cats or siring services. The actual auction functionality is handled in two sibling contracts (one for sales and one for siring), while auction creation and bidding is mostly mediated through this facet of the core contract.According to the devs, they split this auction functionality into \u201csibling\u201d contracts because \u201ctheir logic is somewhat complex and there\u2019s always a risk of subtle bugs. By keeping them in their own contracts, we can upgrade them without disrupting the main contract that tracks kitty ownership.\u201dSo this KittyAuctions contract contains the functions setSaleAuctionAddress() and setSiringAuctionAddress(), which like setGeneScienceAddress() can only be called by the CEO, and sets the address of an external contract that handles these functions.Note: \u201cSiring\u201d is referring to pimping out your cat \u2014 putting it up for auction, where another user can pay you Ether for your cat to breed with theirs. Lols.This means that even if the CryptoKitties contract itself were immutable, the CEO has the flexibility to change the address of these auction contracts down the line, which would change the rules of the auctions. Again, not necessarily a bad thing since sometimes developers need to fix bugs, but something to be aware of.I\u2019m not going to go in depth into how exactly the auction & bidding logic is handled to keep this article from getting too long (it\u2019s already long enough!), but you can check out the code in EthFiddle (search for KittyAuctions).6. KittyMinting: The Gen0 Cat FactoryThis final facet contains the functionality we use for creating new gen0 cats. We can make up to 5000 \u201cpromo\u201d cats that can be given away (especially important when the community is new), and all others can only be created and then immediately put up for auction via an algorithmically determined starting price. Regardless of how they are created, there is a hard limit of 50k gen0 cats. After that, it\u2019s all up to the community to breed, breed, breed!The number of promo cats and gen0 cats the contract is able to create is hard-coded here:uint256 public constant PROMO_CREATION_LIMIT = 5000;uint256 public constant GEN0_CREATION_LIMIT = 45000;And here\u2019s the code where the \u201cCOO\u201d can create promo kitties and gen0 kitties:So with createPromoKitty(), it looks like the COO can create a new kitty with whatever genes he wants, and send it to whoever he wants (up to a max of 5000 kitties). I\u2019m guessing they use this for early beta testers, friends and family, to give away free kitties for promotion purposes, etc.But this also means that your cat may not be as unique as you think, since he can potentially print 5000 identical copies of it!For createGen0Auction(), the COO also provides the genetic code for the new kitty. But instead of assigning it to a specific person\u2019s address, it creates an auction where users would bid Ether to buy the kitty.7. KittyCore: The Master ContractThis is the main CryptoKitties contract, which is what is compiled and running on the Ethereum blockchain. This contract ties everything together.Because of the inheritance structure, it inherits from all the contracts we looked at prior to this, and adds a few more final methods, like this function for getting all a Kitty\u2019s data using its ID:This is a public method that will return all the data for a specific kitty from the blockchain. I imagine this is what is queried by their web server for displaying the cats on the web site.Wait\u2026 I don\u2019t see any image data. What determines what a kitty looks like?As we can see from the code above, a \u201ckitty\u201d basically comes down to a 256-bit unsigned integer that represents its genetic code.There\u2019s nothing in the Solidity contract code that stores a cat\u2019s image, or its description, or that determines what that 256-bit integer actually means. The interpretation of that genetic code happens on CryptoKitty\u2019s web server.So while this is a really clever demonstration of a game on the blockchain, it\u2019s not actually 100% blockchain-based. If their website was taken offline in the future, unless someone had backed up all the images, you would be left with only owning a meaningless 256-bit integer.In the contract code, I did find a contract called ERC721Metadata, but it never ends up getting used for anything. So my guess is they originally planned on storing everything in the blockchain, but later decided against it (too cost prohibitive to store a lot of data in Ethereum?) and so they ended up needing to store it on their web server instead.Tying It All TogetherOk\u2026 So to sum everything up, here we\u2019ve looked at:How kitties are represented as dataHow all kitties in existence are stored in a single smart contract, and how it keeps track of who owns whatHow gen0 kitties are producedHow kitties are bred together to form new kittiesThis was just a top-level overview.

But can the blockchain support it? If not, how far away are we?Requirements to building scaled decentralized applications (dApps)There are two requirements to building scaled dApps:Having all of the necessary parts of the dApp developer stack. I\u2019d say we are 70% to a shaky first version of each.2. Scalability of these components. I think this will be the main limiting factor and what will be discussed in this post.Facebook as a measuring stickLet\u2019s do the math on running something like Facebook. Facebook handles about 175k requests per second (900k users on the site in any given minute, assume an action is taken every 5 seconds). And this probably doesn\u2019t include API requests, which are a better analogue and probably 3\u20134x higher.Where is Ethereum now?First, a note: I am not an Ethereum maximalist, but I think Ethereum is the furthest along and best suited for thinking about scalability right now.At the moment, Ethereum can handle about 13 transactions per second, which cuts in half to about 7 transactions per second for tokens (4.7m gas limit, 21k avg gas price for standard txn = ~220 standard txns every block, current avg block time 17s = 13 txns/sec, gas requirement roughly doubles for token transactions). And this doesn\u2019t include more expensive smart contract execution.By this estimate we\u2019re roughly 250x off being able to run a 10m user app and 25,000x off being able to run Facebook on chain. And since these systems are open rather than proprietary, we\u2019ll see applications bigger than Facebook. This estimate isn\u2019t perfect because the dApp stack functions differently in places than the current Web 2.0 stack. But I believe it\u2019s in the right ballpark. This is why I believe scalability will be the primary bottleneck for the industry for the foreseeable future.Scaling to billions of usersSo how do we get closer to supporting billions of users? Here\u2019s a summary of the scaling efforts I\u2019m aware of:This high level view makes a few things clear:These are hard computer science and game theory problems. Most of them have never been solved before. Estimating completion can be hard and can be far off.Large apps can\u2019t run solely on chain and likely never will. They need off-chain scaling solutions.While it\u2019s tricky to make accurate estimates when combining scaling improvements, it\u2019s conceivable we could see a 100x improvement by the end of 2018, which would allow a 1\u201310m user app.Scaling is multidimensional. Different methods address different things. So it\u2019s hard to measure with a single and global \u201ctransactions per second\u201d metric.These projects have very few people working on them \u2014 in most cases less than 5 people. The people currently working on them are exceptionally talented, so that is not at all a knock on their efforts. If you are a developer getting into the space and want to work on hard problems with large impact, I\u2019d suggest getting in touch with one of these projects. Talk to the Ethereum core devs (for on-chain solutions) by joining the Ethereum Core Gitter chat or contact Vitalik or Vlad, get into payment channel networks by contacting Jeff Coleman or the Raiden Network, or contact Truebit by responding to their active hiring thread on reddit.How can Ethereum systematically scale better?Finally, it is worth thinking about the how this scaling work can be best supported in the future. Capital was the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s biggest constraint in January, and it has prudently managed its finances. However, given recent ETH price changes, the Foundation has over $150m (750k ETH, $30m fiat) and expenses are ~$250k a month. The Foundation can now hire more developers at rates competitive to companies like Google, allowing forward thinking developers to take the plunge. Working in the industry is developing it\u2019s own risk spectrum. Working on Ethereum could be similar to working at a Google: lower risk with broad impact right away. Working on a token is similar to working on a startup: higher risk and lower initial impact but higher upside potential. How core protocol work is best funded beyond the initial Ethereum Foundation endowment is an open question, but likely further out.The community may also want to scale beyond central coordination by the Ethereum Foundation over time. As the chart above shows, this is already happening to a small extent. A simple idea would be feature bounties which the community can request and approve when completed. The community could easily crowdfund $1,000,000+ and let many teams compete like in the DARPA Grand Challenge that kicked off the self driving car push. It\u2019s also possible the Ethereum Foundation moves closer to a decentralized governance model (a DAO) over time, which would have the same effect.ConclusionEverything will be tokenized and connected by a blockchain one day. Scalability is the crux of that journey at the moment. Ethereum is orders of magnitude off from being able to support applications with millions of users at the moment. Yet in true decentralized fashion there are a diverse set of efforts attempting to solve that problem. The biggest bottleneck to solving scalability is the number of people working on the problem. If current efforts are well executed, Ethereum could be ready for a 1\u201310m user app by the end of 2018.Thanks to Joey Krug, Vlad Zamfir, Joseph Chow, Dan Finlay, Simon de la Rouviere, Vitalik Buterin, Chris Dixon, Dan Romero, Ryan Zurrer, Panashe Mahachi, and Matt Huang for ideas and clarifications in this post.", "responses": 156, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Ethereum", "Tech", "Bitcoin", "Startup"]}, {"title": "Announcing instant bitcoin, ethereum and litecoin purchases on Coinbase", "post_link": "https://blog.coinbase.com/announcing-instant-bitcoin-ethereum-and-litecoin-purchases-on-coinbase-c29d8a94e152?source=search_post", "author_name": "David Farmer", "author_link": "https://blog.coinbase.com/@Dfarmer", "publish_date": "2017-10-12", "last_modified_date": "2019-01-05", "readtime": "0.87", "claps": 8285, "voters": 1126, "content": "Announcing instant bitcoin, ethereum and litecoin purchases on CoinbaseDavid FarmerFollowOct 12, 2017 \u00b7 1 min readWe are excited to announce the ability for customers to instantly purchase digital currency using a US bank account.

This is the year when early adoption will test the limits of the network, renewing focus on technologies built to scale ethereum.Ethereum is still in its infancy. Today, it isn\u2019t safe or scalable. This is well understood by anyone who works closely with the technology. But over the last year, the ICO-driven hype has begun to far exaggerate the current capabilities of the network. The promise of ethereum and web3 \u2014 a safe, easy to use decentralized internet, bound by a common set of economic protocols, and used by billions of people \u2014 is still on the horizon, and will not be realized until critical infrastructure is built.The projects working to build this infrastructure and expand the capabilities of ethereum are commonly referred to as scaling solutions. These take many different forms, and are often compatible or complimentary with each other.In this long post I want to dive deep into one category of scaling solution: \u201coff-chain\u201d or \u201clayer 2\u201d solutions.First, we\u2019ll discuss the scaling challenges of ethereum (and all public blockchains) in general.Second, we\u2019ll cover the different approaches to solving the scaling challenge, distinguishing between \u201clayer 1\u201d and \u201clayer 2\u201d solutions.Third, we\u2019ll delve into layer 2 solutions and explain how they work \u2014 specifically, we\u2019ll talk about state channels, Plasma, and TruebitThis article focuses on giving the reader a thorough and detailed conceptual understanding of how layer 2 solutions work. But we won\u2019t dig into code or specific implementations. Rather, we focus on understanding the economic mechanisms used to build these systems, and the common insights that are shared between all layer 2 technologies.1. The scaling challenges of public blockchainsFirst, it\u2019s important to understand that \u201cscaling\u201d isn\u2019t a single, specific problem. It refers to a collection of challenges that must be overcome to make ethereum useful to a global user base of billions of people.The most commonly discussed scaling challenge is transaction throughput. Currently, ethereum can process roughly 15 transactions per second, while in comparison Visa processes approximately 45,000/tps. In the last year, some applications \u2014 like Cryptokitties, or the occasional ICO \u2014 have been popular enough to \u201cslow down\u201d the network and raise gas prices.The core limitation is that public blockchains like ethereum require every transaction to be processed by every single node in the network. Every operation that takes place on the ethereum blockchain \u2014 a payment, the birth of a Cryptokitty, deployment of a new ERC20 contract \u2014 must be performed by every single node in the network in parallel. This is by design \u2014 it\u2019s part of what makes public blockchains authoritative. Nodes don\u2019t have to rely on someone else to tell them what the current state of the blockchain is \u2014 they figure it out for themselves.This puts a fundamental limit on ethereum\u2019s transaction throughput: it cannot be higher than what we are willing to require from an individual node.We could ask every individual node to do more work. If we doubled the block size (i.e., the block gas limit), it would mean that each node is doing roughly double the amount of work processing each block. But this comes at the cost of decentralization: requiring more work from nodes means that less powerful computers (like consumer devices) may drop out of the network, and mining becomes more centralized in powerful node operators.Instead, we need a way for blockchains to do more useful stuff without increasing the workload on individual nodes.Conceptually, there are two ways we might go about solving this problem:I. What if each node didn\u2019t have to process every operation in parallel?The first approach rejects our premise \u2014 what if we could build a blockchain where every node didn\u2019t have to process every operation? What if, instead, the network was divided into two sections, which could operate semi-independently?Section A could process one batch of transactions, while Section B processed another batch. This would effectively double the transaction throughput of a blockchain, since our limit is now what can be processed by two nodes at the same time. If we can split a blockchain into many different sections, then we can increase the throughput of a blockchain by many multiples.This is the insight behind \u201csharding\u201d, a scaling solution being pursued by Vitalik\u2019s Ethereum Research group and others. A blockchain is split into different sections called shards, each of which can independently process transactions. Sharding is often referred to as a Layer 1 scaling solution because it is implemented at the base-level protocol of ethereum itself. If you want to learn more about sharding, I recommend this extensive FAQ and this blog post.II. What if we could squeeze more useful operations out of ethereum\u2019s existing capacity?The second option goes in the opposite direction: rather than increase the capacity of the ethereum blockchain itself, what if we could do more things with the capacity we already have? The throughput of the base-layer ethereum blockchain would be the same, but in practice we would be able to do many more operations that are useful to people and applications \u2014 like transactions, state updates in a game, or simple computations.This is the insight behind \u201coff-chain\u201d technologies like state channels, Plasma, and Truebit. While each of these is solving a different problem, they all function by performing operations \u201coff chain\u201d instead of on the ethereum blockchain, while still guaranteeing a sufficient level of security and finality.These are also known as Layer 2 solutions because they are built \u201con top of\u201d the ethereum main-chain. They do not require changes to the base level protocol \u2014 rather, they exist simply as smart contracts on ethereum that interact with off-chain software.2. Layer 2 solutions are cryptoeconomic solutionsBefore diving into specific layer 2 solutions, it\u2019s important to understand the underlying insight that makes them possible.The basic power of a public blockchain is in cryptoeconomic consensus. By carefully aligning incentives and securing them with software & cryptography, we can create networks of computers that reliably come to agreement about the internal state of a system. This is the key insight of Satoshi\u2019s whitepaper, which has now been applied in the design of many different public blockchains including bitcoin and ethereum.Cryptoeconomic consensus gives us a core hard kernel of certainty \u2014 unless something extreme like a 51% attack happens, we know that on-chain operations \u2014 like payments, or smart-contracts \u2014 will execute as written.The insight behind layer 2 solutions is that we can use this core kernel of certainty as an anchor \u2014 a fixed point to which we attach additional economic mechanisms. This second layer of economic mechanisms can extend the utility of public blockchains outwards, letting us have interactions off of the blockchain that can still reliably refer back to that core kernel if necessary.These layers built \u201con top\u201d of ethereum won\u2019t always have the same guarantee as on-chain operations. But they can still be sufficiently final and secure to be very useful \u2014 especially when that slight decrease in finality lets us perform operations much faster or with lower overhead costs.Cryptoeconomics didn\u2019t begin and end with Satoshi\u2019s whitepaper \u2014 it\u2019s a body of techniques that we are only learning to apply. Not just in the design of core protocols, but in the design of second layer systems that extend the functionality of the underlying blockchain.I. State channelsState channels are a technique for performing transactions and other state updates \u201coff chain\u201d. However, things that happen \u201cinside\u201d of a state channel still retain a very high degree of security and finality: if anything goes wrong, we still have the option of referring back to the \u201chard kernel\u201d of certainty found in on-chain transactions.Most readers will be familiar with the idea of a payment channel, which has been around for several years, and recently implemented on bitcoin through the lightning network. State channels are the more general form of payment channels \u2014 they can be used not only for payments, but for any arbitrary \u201cstate update\u201d on a blockchain \u2014 like changes inside a smart contract. State channels were first described in detail by Jeff Coleman in 2015.The best way to explain how a state channel works is by looking at an example. Keep in mind that this is a conceptual explanation, meaning that we won\u2019t get into the technical details of a specific implementation.Imagine that Alice and Bob want to play a game of tic tac toe, where the winner receives 1 eth. The naive way to do this would be to create a smart contract on ethereum that implements the rules of tic tac toe and keeps track of each players\u2019 moves. Every time a player wants to make a move, they send a transaction to the contract. When one player wins, as determined by the rules, the contract pays out the 1 eth to the winner.This works, but is inefficient and slow. Alice and Bob are having the entire ethereum network process their game, which might be overkill for what they need. They have to pay gas costs every time a player wants to make a move, and they have to wait for blocks to be mined before making the next move.Instead, we can design a system that lets Alice and Bob play tic-tac-toe with as few on-chain operations as possible. Alice and Bob will be able to update the state of the game off-chain, while still having full confidence that they can revert back to the ethereum main-chain if necessary. We call this system a \u201cstate channel\u201d.First, we create a smart contract \u201cJudge\u201d on the ethereum main-chain that understands the rules of tic-tac-toe, and can identify Alice and Bob as the two players in our game. This contract holds the 1 eth prize.Then, Alice and Bob begin playing the game. Alice creates and signs a transaction describing her first move, and sends it to Bob, who also signs it, sends back the signed version, and keeps a copy for himself. Then Bob creates and signs a transaction describing his first move, and sends it to Alice, who also signs it, sends it back, and keeps a copy. Each time, they are updating the current state of the game between them. Each transaction contains a \u201cnonce\u201d, which simply means that we can always tell later in what order the moves happened.So far, none of this is happening on-chain. Alice and Bob are simply sending transactions to each other over the internet, but nothing is hitting the blockchain yet. However, all of the transactions could be sent to the Judge contract \u2014 in other words, they are valid ethereum transactions. You can picture this as two people writing a series of blockchain-certified cheques back and forth to each other. No money has actually been deposited or withdrawn from a bank, but each has a stack of cheques that they could deposit whenever they want.When Alice and Bob are done playing the game \u2014 perhaps because Alice has won \u2014 they can close the channel by submitting the final state (e.g. a list of transactions) to the Judge contract, paying only a single transaction fee. The Judge ensures that this \u201cfinal state\u201d is signed by both parties, and waits a period of time to ensure that no one can legitimately challenge the result, and then pays out the 1 eth award to Alice.Why do we need this \u201cchallenge period\u201d where the Judge contract waits?Imagine that instead of sending the real final state to the Judge, Bob sent an old version of the state \u2014 one where he was winning ahead of Alice. The Judge is just a dumb contract \u2014 on its own, it has no way of knowing whether this is the most recent state or not.The challenge period gives Alice a chance to prove to the Judge contract that Bob has lied about the final state of the game. If there is a more recent state, then she will have a copy of the signed transactions, and she can submit those to the Judge. The Judge can tell that Alice\u2019s version is more recent by checking the nonce, and Bob\u2019s attempt to steal the win is rejected.Features and limitationsState channels are useful in many applications, where they are a strict improvement over doing operations on-chain. However, it\u2019s important to keep in mind the particular tradeoffs that have been made when deciding whether an application is suitable for being channelized:State channels rely on availability. If Alice lost her internet connection during a challenge (maybe because Bob, desperate to claim the prize, sabotaged her home\u2019s internet connection) she might not be able to respond before the challenge period ends. However, Alice can pay someone else to keep a copy of her state and maintain availability on her behalf.They\u2019re particularly useful where participants are going to be exchanging many state updates over a long period of time. This is because there is an initial cost to creating a channel in deploying the Judge contract. But once it is deployed, the cost per state update inside that channel is extremely low.State channels are best used for applications with a defined set of participants. This is because the Judge contract must always know the entities (i.e. addresses) that are part of a given channel. We can add and remove people, but it requires a change to the contract each time.State channels have strong privacy properties, because everything is happening \u201cinside\u201d a channel between participants, rather than broadcast publicly and recorded on-chain. Only the opening and closing transactions must be public.State channels have instant finality, meaning that as soon as both parties sign a state update, it can be considered final. Both parties have a very high guarantee that, if necessary, they can \u201cenforce\u201d that state on-chain.At L4, we\u2019re building Counterfactual: a framework for generalized state channels on ethereum. Our general purpose, modular implementation will let developers use state channels in their application without needing to be state channel experts themselves. You can read more about the project here. We\u2019ll be releasing a paper describing our technique in Q1 2018.The other notable state channels project for ethereum is Raiden, which is currently focused on building a network of payment channels, using a similar paradigm as the lightning network. This means that rather than have to open up a channel with the specific person(s) you want to transact with, you can open up a single channel with an entity connected to a much larger network of channels, enabling you to make payments to anyone else connected to the same network without additional fees.In addition to Counterfactual and Raiden, there are several application-specific channel implementations on ethereum. For instance, Funfair has built state channels (which they call \u201cFate channels\u201d) for their decentralized gambling platform, Spankchain has built one-way payment channels for adult performers (they also used a state channel for their ICO), and Horizon Games is using state channels in their first ethereum-based game.II. PlasmaOn August 11 2017, Vitalik Buterin and Joseph Poon released a paper titled Plasma: Autonomous Smart Contracts. The paper introduced a novel technique that could enable ethereum to reach many more transactions per second than currently possible.Like state channels, Plasma is a technique for conducting off-chain transactions while relying on the underlying ethereum blockchain to ground its security. But Plasma takes the idea in a new direction, by allowing for the creation of \u201cchild\u201d blockchains attached to the \u201cmain\u201d ethereum blockchain. These child-chains can, in turn, spawn their own child-chains, who can spawn their own child-chains, and so on.The result is that we can perform many complex operations at the child-chain level, running entire applications with many thousands of users, with only minimal interaction with the ethereum main-chain. A Plasma child-chain can move faster, and charge lower transaction fees, because operations on it do not need to be replicated across the entire ethereum blockchain.plasma.io/plasma.pdfIn order to understand how Plasma works, let\u2019s walk through an example of how it could be used.Let\u2019s imagine that you\u2019re creating a trading-card game on ethereum. The cards will be ERC 721 non-fungible tokens (like Cryptokitties), but have certain features and attributes that lets users play against each other \u2014 like in Hearthstone, or Magic the Gathering. These kinds of complex operations are expensive to do on-chain, so you decide to use Plasma instead for your application.First, we create a set of smart-contracts on ethereum main-chain that serve as the \u201cRoot\u201d of our Plasma child-chain. The Plasma root contains the basic \u201cstate-transition rules\u201d of our child chain (things like \u201ctransactions cannot spend assets that have already been spent\u201d), records hashes of the child-chain\u2019s state, and serves as a kind of \u201cbridge\u201d that lets users move assets between the ethereum main-chain and the child-chain.Then, we create our child-chain. The child-chain can have its own consensus algorithm \u2014 in this example, let\u2019s say that it uses Proof of Authority (PoA), a simple consensus mechanism that relies on trusted block producers (i.e. validators). Block producers are analogous to miners in a \u201cProof of Work\u201d system \u2014 they are the nodes that receive transactions, form blocks, and collect transaction fees. Let\u2019s keep our example simple, and say that you (the company that created the game) are the only entity that is creating blocks \u2014 i.e. your company runs a few nodes that are the block producers for our child-chain.Once the child-chain is created and active, the block producers make periodic commitments to the root contract. This means they are effectively saying \u201cI commit that the most recent block in the child-chain is X\u201d. These commitments are recorded on-chain in the Plasma root as a proof of what has happened in the child-chain.Now that the child-chain is ready, we can create the basic components of our trading card game. The cards themselves are ERC721\u2019s, initially created on the ethereum main-chain, and then moved onto the child-chain through the plasma root. This introduces a crucial point: Plasma lets us scale interactions with blockchain-based digital assets, but those assets should be created first on the ethereum-main chain. Then, we deploy the actual game application smart-contracts on the child-chain, which contains all of the game logic and rules.When a user wants to play our game, they are only interacting with the child chain. They can hold assets (the ERC721 cards), buy and trade them for ether, play rounds of the game against other users \u2014 whatever our game lets them do \u2014 without ever interacting directly with the main-chain. Because only a much smaller number of nodes (i.e. block producers) have to process transactions, fees can be much lower and operations can be faster.But how can this be safe?By moving more operations off the main-chain and onto a child-chain, it\u2019s clear we can perform more operations. But how secure is it? Are transactions that happen on the child-chain actually considered final? After all, we\u2019ve just described a system where a single entity controls the block production for our child chain. Isn\u2019t that centralized? Can\u2019t the company steal your funds or take your collectible cards whenever it wants?The short answer is that even in a scenario where a single entity controls 100% of block production on a child chain, Plasma gives you a basic guarantee that you can always withdraw your funds and assets back onto the main chain. If a block producer starts acting maliciously, the worst that can happen is they force you to leave the child-chain.Let\u2019s walk through a few different ways block producers could behave badly, and see how Plasma deals with those scenarios.First, imagine that a block producer tries to cheat you by lying \u2014 by creating a fake new block where suddenly your funds are controlled by them. They are the only block producer, so they\u2019re free to introduce a new block that doesn\u2019t actually follow the rules of our blockchain. Just like other blocks, they will have to publish a commitment to the Plasma root contract containing evidence of this block.As mentioned above, the user always has an ultimate guarantee that they can withdraw their assets back to main-chain. In this scenario, the user (or rather an application acting on their behalf) would detect the attempted theft, and withdraw before the block producer can try and use the assets they\u2019ve \u201cstolen\u201d.Plasma also creates a mechanism to prevent fraud short of withdrawing to main-chain. Plasma includes a mechanism whereby anyone \u2014 including you \u2014 can publish a fraud proof to the root contract, to try and show that the block producer has cheated. This fraud proof would contain information about the previous block, and allows us to show that according to the state-transition rules of the child-chain, the false block doesn\u2019t properly follow from the previous state. If fraud is proven, the child-chain is \u201crolled back\u201d to the previous block. Even better, we construct a system where any block producer who signed off on the false block is penalized by losing an on-chain deposit.plasma.io/plasma.pdfBut submitting a fraud proof requires having access to the underlying data \u2014 i.e. the actual history of blocks that are used to prove the fraud. What if the block producers are also not sharing information about previous blocks, to prevent Alice from being able to submit a fraud proof to the root contract?In this case, the solution is for Alice to withdraw her funds and leave the child-chain. Essentially Alice submits a \u201cProof of Funds\u201d to the root contract. After a delay period during which anyone can challenge her proof (e.g. to show she actually spent those funds in a later valid block), Alice\u2019s funds are moved back to the ethereum main-chain.plasma.io/plasma.pdfLastly, block producers can censor users of the child-chain. If they wanted, block producers could simply never include certain transactions in their blocks, effectively preventing a user from performing any operations on the child-chain. Once again, the solution is simply to withdraw all of our assets back onto the ethereum main-chain as above.Withdrawals themselves pose risks, however. One concern is what would happen if everyone using a child-chain tried to withdraw at the same time. In the case of a mass withdrawal, there might not be enough capacity on the ethereum main-chain to process everyone\u2019s transactions within the challenge period, meaning users could lose funds. Although there are many possible techniques for preventing this, e.g. by extending the challenge period in a way that is responsive to demand for withdrawals.It\u2019s worth noting that it doesn\u2019t need to be the case that all block producers are controlled by one entity \u2014 this is simply the extreme case in our example. We can create child-chains whose block production is spread among many different entities \u2014 i.e. actually decentralized in a way that is more similar to public blockchains. In those cases, there is less risk that block producers would interfere in the way described above, and so less risk that a user would have to move their assets back to the ethereum main-chain.Now that we\u2019ve covered both state channels and Plasma, it\u2019s worth noting a few points of comparison.One difference is that state channels can perform instant withdrawals when all of the parties in the channel consent to the withdrawal. If Alice and Bob agree to close out a channel and withdraw their funds, so long as they both agree to the final state they can get their assets out of the channel immediately. This is not possible on Plasma, where users must always go through a withdrawal process that involves a challenge period, as described above.State channels should also be less expensive per transaction than Plasma, and be faster. This means that we will likely build state channels on Plasma child-chains. For example, in an application where two users are exchanging a series of small transactions. Building a state channel at the child-chain level should be cheaper and faster than performing each of those transactions on the child-chain directly.Finally, it\u2019s worth noting that this is only a partial description that leaves out many details. Plasma itself is in very early stages. If you\u2019re interested in learning more about current work on Plasma, check out Vitalik\u2019s recent proposal for a \u201cMinimal Viable plasma\u201d (i.e. a stripped-down plasma implementation). There\u2019s work being done by a group based in Taiwan, which you can find in this repo. OmiseGo is working on an implementation for their decentralized exchange \u2014 they posted a recent update about their progress here.III. TruebitTruebit is a technology to help ethereum conduct heavy or complex computation off-chain. This makes it different from state channels and Plasma, which are more useful for increasing the total transaction throughput of the ethereum blockchain. As we discussed in the opening section, scaling is a multi-faceted challenge that requires more than high transaction throughput. Truebit won\u2019t let us do more transactions, but it will let ethereum based applications do more complex things in a way that can still be verified by the main-chain.This will let us do operations useful to ethereum applications that are too computationally expensive to do on chain. For instance, validating Simple Payment Verification (SPV) proofs from other blockchains, which could let ethereum smart-contracts \u201ccheck\u201d whether a transaction has happened on another chain (like bitcoin or dogecoin).Let\u2019s walk through an example. Imagine that you have some expensive computation \u2014 like an SPV proof \u2014 that needs to be performed as part of an ethereum application. You can\u2019t simply do it as part of a smart contract on ethereum main-chain, because SPV proofs are far too computationally expensive. Remember, it\u2019s very costly to perform any computation on ethereum because every node must perform that operation in parallel. Blocks in ethereum have a maximum gas limit that sets a cap on how much computation can be done by all the transactions combined in that block. But an SPV proof is so computationally expensive that it would require many multiples of the entire gas limit for an individual block, even if it were the only transaction inside.Instead, you pay someone else a small fee to do the computation off chain. The person you paid to do this is called a solver.First, the solver pays a deposit held in a smart contract. Then, you give the solver a description of the computation they need to execute for you. They run the computation, and return the result. If the result is correct (more on that in a second), their deposit is returned. If it turns out that solver did not properly perform the computation \u2014 i.e. they cheated or made a mistake \u2014 they lose their deposit.But how can we tell whether the result was correct, or false? Truebit uses an economic mechanism called the \u201cverification game\u201d. Essentially, we create an incentive for other parties called challengers to check the solvers\u2019 work. If a challenger is able to prove through the verification game that a solver submitted a false result, then they collect a reward, while the solver loses their deposit.Because the verification game is performed on-chain, it cannot simply compute the result (which would defeat the entire purpose of the system \u2014 if we could do the computation on-chain, we wouldn\u2019t need Truebit). Rather, we force both the solver and challenger to identify the specific operation that they disagree about. In effect, we are backing both parties into a corner \u2014 finding the actual line of code where they disagree about the outcome.Simplified conceptual diagram of TruebitOnce that specific operation is identified, it\u2019s small enough to actually be executed by the ethereum main-chain. We then execute that operation through a smart-contract on ethereum, which settles once and for all which party was telling the truth and which was lying or mistaken.If you want to learn more about Truebit, you can read the paper here, or this blog post by Simon de la Rouviere.ConclusionLayer 2 solutions share a common insight: once we have the hard kernel of certainty provided by a public blockchain, we can use it as an anchor for cryptoeconomic systems that extend the usefulness of blockchain applications.Now that we\u2019ve surveyed some examples, we can be more specific about how layer 2 solutions apply this insight. The economic mechanisms used by layer 2 solutions tend to be interactive games: they work by creating incentives for different parties to compete against or \u201ccheck\u201d one another. A blockchain application can assume that a given claim is likely true, because we\u2019ve created a strong incentive for another party to provide information showing it to be false.In state channels, this is how we confirm the final state of the channel \u2014 by giving parties a chance to \u201crebut\u201d each other. In Plasma, it\u2019s how we manage fraud-proofs and withdrawals. In Truebit, it\u2019s how we ensure that solvers\u2019 tell the truth \u2014 by giving an incentive to verifiers to prove the solver wrong.These systems will help address some of the challenges involved in scaling ethereum to a massive global user base. Some, like state channels and Plasma, will increase the transaction throughput of the platform. Others, like Truebit, will make it possible to conduct more difficult computation as part of a smart contract, opening up new use cases.These three examples represent only a small portion of the possible design space for cryptoeconomic scaling solutions. We\u2019ve not even covered the work being done on \u201cinter-blockchain protocols\u201d like Cosmos or Polkadot (although whether these are \u201clayer 2\u201d solutions or something else altogether is a topic for another post). We should also expect to invent new and unexpected layer 2 systems that improve on existing models or offer new tradeoffs between speed, finality, and overhead.More important than any particular layer 2 solution is further development of the underlying techniques and mechanisms that make them possible in the first place: cryptoeconomic design.These layer 2 scaling solutions are a powerful argument for the long-term value of programmable blockchains like ethereum. Building the economic mechanisms underlying layer 2 solutions is only possible when a blockchain is programmable: you need a scripting language to write the programs that enforce the interactive games. This is much more difficult (or in some cases, like Plasma, probably impossible) on blockchains like bitcoin, which offer only limited scripting possibilities.Ethereum lets us build layer 2 solutions to access new points on the tradeoff matrix between speed, finality, and overhead cost. This makes the underlying blockchain more useful for a larger variety of applications, since different types of applications with different threat models will have natural preferences towards different tradeoffs. For high value transactions where we want protection against even nation-states, we use the main chain. For trading digital collectibles where speed is more important, we can use Plasma. Layer 2 lets us make these tradeoffs without compromising the underlying blockchain, preserving decentralization and finality.Further, it\u2019s very hard to predict in advance what scripting capabilities will be needed for a given scaling solution. When ethereum was being designed, Plasma and Truebit had not yet been invented. But because ethereum is fully programmable, it is capable of implementing virtually any economic mechanism we can invent.The only way to take full advantage of the value of blockchain technology \u2014 that core kernel of certainty created by cryptoeconomic consensus \u2014 is with a programmable blockchain like ethereum.Thanks to Vitalik Buterin, Jon Choi, Matt Condon, Chris Dixon, Hudson Jameson, Denis Nazarov, and Jesse Walden for their comments on an earlier draft of this article.", "responses": 35, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Ethereum", "Cryptoeconomics", "State Channels"]}, {"title": "How to beat FOMO: What are Bitcoin & Ethereum worth in 2020?", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@bobbyullery/how-to-beat-fomo-what-are-bitcoin-ethereum-worth-in-2020-bc9c84961025?source=search_post", "author_name": "Bobby Ullery @bobbyullery", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@bobbyullery", "publish_date": "2017-06-13", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-20", "readtime": "5.04", "claps": 1890, "voters": 505, "content": "How to beat FOMO: What are Bitcoin & Ethereum worth in 2020?6/13/17 Edit: updated with feedback from a few RedditorsBobby Ullery @bobbyulleryFollowJun 13, 2017 \u00b7 6 min readIt\u2019s been a big year for cryptocurrencies, with the total market cap for crypto jumping 6x since January 1st - from $18B to over $111B as of June 13th.The FOMO (fear of missing out) is real. New money is entering the market at a staggering rate - to the degree that many exchanges have had problems on-boarding and verifying their new customers to keep up with demand.These new investors are coming in droves after hearing about sky-high returns from a friend or friend\u2019s friend or a friend of a friend\u2019s friend.Once they\u2019ve gotten through the verification process on Coinbase or Gemini or Kraken, they execute their first market order and the rush of the cryptocraze washes over them. To the MOON!Then price drops by 10%, our new investor freaks out, convinces themselves that they\u2019re hardly ever right, that ETH or BTC is going to $0 and that they should just cut their losses. They panic sell, adding fuel to the micro-bear run and the price continues to drop. Whew, that was close. Got out just in time.A short time later, they see that the price is not only retracing back toward their entry price, soon they\u2019ll realize that it will exceed it. They just bought high and sold low. They leave the market.Recent moments of FOMO in BTC & ETH tradingWe\u2019ve seen this play out a number of times this year, and as an investor myself, I too get concerned when I see the price of ETH & BTC begin a FOMO trend. I\u2019ve seen the value of my portfolio drop by 20\u201350% in hours.However, in order to counteract FOMO and any knee-jerk panic selling reaction I might have, I\u2019ve done two things:First, I\u2019ve taken my coins off of the exchanges. This prevents me from having my finger on the trigger and selling in any sell-off or panic. I suggest you do the same, even if only for the security of storing your coins in a wallet to which you alone own the private key.Second, I\u2019ve quantified what I think Ether and Bitcoin will be worth in 2020. This personal thesis keeps me confident of the longer term state of crypto and in my investment. I\u2019m not here to day trade, I\u2019m here for the long term \u2014 and this helps me weather the storms. I\u2019m not even saying I\u2019m right, but it changes my long term perspective and makes be a more patient investor.I think Bitcoin and Ethereum will share a $4.5 trillion market cap by 2020.Uh ok, whoa partner, how did you arrive there? Here\u2019s my simple explanation:Sizing the world economyThe nominal GDP of the world economy (as of 2016) is $78 trillion. By 2020 the IMF estimates the nGDP will be $91 trillion:http://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/NGDPD@WEO/OEMDC/ADVEC/WEOWORLDAsk yourself, in three years, do you think that 5% of the world\u2019s GDP could be stored and exchanged using blockchain technology?Me too \u2014 for many reasons: The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance; the massive investment that world banks are making in blockchain technology; the interest in digitizing the currencies of countries like Russia, China and others; the leveling of global political power; because it\u2019s cheap, faster and more secure than current financial technologies.Ok, assumption granted. Now some math. If 5% of the world\u2019s GDP in 2020 is housed on the prevailing blockchains, then the value of crypto will be ~$4.55 trillion.If ETH/BTC are the anointed blockchains, what are the value of those networks?For simplicity and bi-partisanship, let\u2019s assume that BTC & ETH are equally dominant, each with 25% of the total market size of crypto, with the remaining 50% distributed across hundreds of other coins, perhaps private bank and treasury networks.This means that BTC and ETH would each represent 25% of that $4.55 trillion, or $1.1375T each.How much could one Bitcoin be worth?In 2020, there will be ~18,375,000 BTC in circulation. $1,137,500,000,000 divided by 18,375,000 = $61,900 per coin, ~+2,200% from today.How much could one Ether be worth?This is a little harder to calculate due to the somewhat unknown supply of Ether in the future, how Proof-of-Stake might change new Ether issuance, and the impact that the Ice Age will have on time between new ETH issuance.The original 2014 issuance model, stated a projection of ~162M ETH in circulation in 2020, however /u/manly_ pointed out that Vitalik has said it would be closer to 100M, so for our rough math we\u2019ll use 100M ETH.$1,137,500,000,000 divided by 100,000,000 = $11,375 per coin, ~+4,000% from today.Ok, what if BTC and ETH are much more dominant than a combined 50% of crypto?If BTC and ETH represent 33% of the total market opportunity each, then each would have a total value of $1.502 trillion.BTC would be worth $81,742 ~+2,900% from today.ETH would be worth $15,020 ~+5,300% from today.Again, this is just an apples to apples comparison, it doesn\u2019t take into account market speculations, dividends from Proof-of-Stake or incentives from new BIPs or EIPs, or other external forces that could factor in.So, if 5% of nGDP by 2020 is achieved, the question becomes which could be the dominant coin?I don\u2019t know the answer to that. However, I do believe that there is room in the sandbox for not only BTC and ETH, but others as well. If I had to choose, I think ETH is not only at parity to BTC in it\u2019s ability to store and transmit value, but is also the underpinning for additional value-add networks to be built on top of it, in any industry. This might tip the scales in ETH\u2019s favor, but I do not believe this is a winner take all, zero sum game. What\u2019s good for BTC is good for ETH, what\u2019s good for ETH is good for BTC.What\u2019s good? Adoption.In conclusionDon\u2019t FOMO your coins, the long term implications of blockchain technology are bigger than any one company, bigger than any one market segment. Keep your eye on the long term and hold your investment through short-term dips.I\u2019m not saying my projections are correct either, I simply want to put into world how I foresee the value of ETH/BTC, where I get my justification for holding long-term, and how I am at peace during FOMO or any other market volatility.Edit: some readers pointed out a mistake in my math. I actually did the calculations based on 5% of the current GDP and not 2020\u2019s.

You can read more about Ethereum Classic here. You can read more about what a cryptocurrency fork is here.Q: When will trading be available?Per our public process for adding new assets, we will now begin the engineering work (Step 4) for supporting Ethereum Classic. As part of this process, customers can expect to see public-facing APIs and other signs that the asset is being added. When we reach the final testing phase of the technical integration, which we expect to occur over the next few months, we will publicly announce a launch date for trading via our blog and Twitter (Step 5).Q: How will you roll out trading support for a new asset?When we reach the final testing of the technical integration, we will announce a date that customers on Pro and Prime can begin placing limit orders on the Ethereum Classic order book on Coinbase Markets. Once that resting market reaches sufficient liquidity, we will then enable trading.Q: What geographies will you offer support for Ethereum Classic?We plan to offer support for Ethereum Classic in all geographies where the asset is compliant with local law.Q: How did you control for material nonpublic information when deciding to add support for Ethereum Classic?We followed our public process for adding new assets to Coinbase. Also, any personnel at Coinbase who were aware of the company\u2019s plans to add Ethereum Classic were subject to a trading blackout.Q: What assets are you adding next?We have previously announced our intention to support the ERC20 technical standard and Bitcoin forks. We will announce the intention to add specific assets within those categories prior to final engineering integration. This is consistent with our public process for adding new assets.Q: I had Ethereum on GDAX at the time of the July 2016 hard fork and I did not withdraw my Ethereum Classic prior to January 2017. Will I receive an Ethereum Classic credit when trading launches?Yes. Note that Ethereum was only supported on GDAX at the time of the July 2016 hard fork. Support for Ethereum on Coinbase\u2019s consumer interface was added after the hard fork, so only exchange users that had Ethereum balances were subsequently eligible for Ethereum Classic withdrawals.", "responses": 17, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Ethereum Classic", "Coinbase"]}, {"title": "Why Ethereum 1.0 failed and Bitcoin succeeded", "post_link": "https://medium.com/coinmonks/why-ethereum-1-0-failed-and-bitcoin-succeeded-72e9594b9789?source=search_post", "author_name": "Noah Ruderman", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@noahruderman", "publish_date": "2019-01-22", "last_modified_date": "2019-05-21", "readtime": "6.10", "claps": 3440, "voters": 462, "content": "Why Ethereum 1.0 failed and Bitcoin succeededNoah RudermanFollowJan 22 \u00b7 7 min readIntroductionEthereum 1.0 wouldn\u2019t be undergoing a complete redesign unless it had major flaws. So how did we get here? And why did Bitcoin seem to fare much better? Two important factors are user experience and economics. At a minimum, for a product to succeed it needs to be a compelling alternative to an existing problem, and the transaction fee must not exceed the economic value of the actual transactions. Together these point to an upwards trajectory for Bitcoin and a downwards trajectory for Ethereum 1.0.Competing on User ExperienceThere\u2019s a saying that for one product to replace another with network effects, it needs to be ten times better. Specifically it must be good enough to justify the painful switching costs. Here we examine that first competitor and if those improvements could arguably be called a 10x better experience.Bitcoin was 10x betterWho was Bitcoin\u2019s first competitor? Gold comes to mind, but Bitcoin\u2019s inflation in the early years was very large, far exceeding that of physical gold mining. There was little Bitcoin had to offer gold bugs in terms of longevity, inflation, decentralization, at least for now. It was not yet a competitive product.Rather, Bitcoin\u2019s first competitor was the wire / ACH transfer. In the developed world it\u2019s hard to think of someone without a bank account, and the base of people with experience using these workflows is about as high as the number of people who have ever filed taxes. Moving money could cost $30 for a wire, and take one business day which could mean three total days given that banks often don\u2019t operate on the weekend. ACH transfers are cheaper but much slower, taking 3\u20135 business days to process.Bitcoin was an obvious 10x improvement on the wire / ACH transferBitcoin was an obvious improvement with 10 minute block times and fees that were for a very long time under a penny. Unlike banks, Bitcoin didn\u2019t shut down after 5 PM or on weekends. It was an obvious 10x improvement, so much so that years later many continued to think of Bitcoin as a consumer payments network rather than a settlement layer.That Bitcoin is today thought of as an alternative to gold rather than the wire transfer is irrelevant. During its most formative years it was able to onboard users by providing a clear alternative to bank transfers.Ethereum turned out to be 10x worseWho was Ethereum\u2019s first competitor? Many think it was Bitcoin, but it was hardly better equipped to offer a substantial improvement with respect to payments. Rather, than being engineered for payments, it was a general purpose platform and originally branded a \u201cworld computer\u201d.This world computer where anybody could write their own decentralized applications was often referred to as ushering in Web 3.0, where Ethereum would presumably be the backbone of a secure and decentralized internet. Since the contemporary web is referred to as Web 2.0, I think it\u2019s a fair thing to say it was Ethereum\u2019s first competitor. Both the internet and Ethereum share the common trait of being permissionless platforms that anyone can build on.Ethereum was unfortunately 10x worse than the web 2.0 it sought to replaceThe contemporary web is built out using the client-server model and is extremely scalable thanks to horizontal scaling (analogous to sharding). This ability to scale is its superpower: there are billions of internet connected users, tens of billions of internet connected devices, and room for more. Latency is often so small it\u2019s often not neurologically perceivable. Bandwidth is good enough to stream video and costs are largely free, subsidized by advertising.Ethereum is not exactly a platform ready in any sense to offer improvements on the contemporary web. Its bandwidth isn\u2019t enough to upload small images (the most data that can be uploaded per block is about 13 KB). At 15 transactions per second only about 1 million daily active users can be supported. Latency is far longer than the 2 second limit that will frustrate users on the web. Every state change is approximately $0.06, which bodes poorly given how much interactivity is part of the normal web browsing experience.Ethereum is unfortunately not the 10x improvement anyone is looking for. If we\u2019re polite, it\u2019s a 10x worse experience. And if we\u2019re honest, it\u2019s several orders of magnitude worse still. Ethereum was picking a battle that couldn\u2019t be won here. Web 2.0\u2019s superpower was scalability and that was Ethereum\u2019s weakness.Economics of transactionsIt\u2019s an economic reality that the value of the transactions must at a minimum exceed the transaction fees paid. Without this, we can\u2019t realistically expect to onboard users. Nobody is interested in leaving money on the table. Single fee markets behave like you might expect, but multiple competing fee markets can crowd out applications with low economic value.Bitcoin\u2019s single-application platform was smooth sailingTransactions on Bitcoin were intended for wealth transfer. Although there were secondary uses of Bitcoin such as gambling and storing data, the primary function had the highest economic value. This meant that using the platform as intended was not impeded by secondary uses.Ethereum\u2019s multi-application platform had unexpected interactionsTransactions on Ethereum were meant to power dapps. Wealth transfer was meant to be a secondary use that unfortunately could not be designed out of Ethereum. So what happens when a low-value application is on the same platform as a high-value application? Unless they both offer comparable economic value, the low-value application may be entirely priced out. Picture dapp A\u2019s bottom 1st percentile of transactions justifying a fee of above $0.06 and dapp B\u2019s top 99th percentile of transactions justifying a fee of below $0.06.Wealth transfer out-priced dapps on EthereumIn Ethereum\u2019s case, despite its intended use case being for decentralized applications, the most popular use of Ethereum is still just transferring wealth without the assistance of dapps. Ironically, what was surely considered to be a secondary use of Ethereum is now setting a transaction fee baseline that\u2019s putting dapps out of business.Interacting with the web, unlike transferring wealth, is not a high-risk workflow. If you try to authenticate to a website or update your Facebook status and there is some interruption or error, you can try again. There is no real risk of catastrophic loss and consequently little need for security, legal systems, or insurance like with wealth transfer. This is largely the reason that software engineering doesn\u2019t require licenses to work in, in contrast with other fields like medicine or other engineering fields.Web 3.0 applications have been crowded out by wealth transfer. This has been the fate of most dapps, failing to deliver economic value on a per transaction basis greater than the current median fee of $0.06.The Ethereum 1.0 dapps that survived lacked tractionWith that said, there have been a few categories of dapps which have provided enough economic value to survive. Most notably they are gambling, decentralized exchanges for on-chain tokens, prediction markets, ICOs, and collateral-backed loans. What they share is that people are willing to pay on par with baseline transaction fee for these workflows. (It is not a coincidence that they involve moving potentially large sums of money at once.) The problem, however, is that these are niche applications whose values are way out of line.0x, one of the most popular dex protocols, has collected only $2000 in lifetime transaction fees despite having a market cap of $160M. The token is also not necessary for the protocol to function and will likely be forked out by major relayers. Augur, the most popular prediction market, has only $40k staked in predictions yet has a $170M market cap. No dapp has more than 1000 daily active users on a regular basis and only a couple dozen have more than 100 daily active users. Something is not right with these numbers.ConclusionsSo why did Bitcoin do so well and Ethereum always seemed to struggle?Bitcoin was a 10x improvement over the wire / ACH transfer. Bitcoin only had one use case which also had high economic value, so the fee market adjusted to what users were willing to pay.Ethereum 1.0 was 10x worse compared to contemporary web architecture. It was an unherently unscalable system (monolithic blockchain) competing with an extremely scalable system (modern web). The situation is so bad that they need a complete rearchitecture. Wealth transfer on Ethereum (not intended to be the primary use-case) created a baseline transaction fee which drowned out all applications with low economic value (i.e. most dapps). The dapps that did survive were less numerous and successful than what was expected.", "responses": 31, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Ethereum", "Bitcoin", "Cryptocurrency", "Technology"]}, {"title": "Want to buy VIT?

It represents the public\u2019s chance to purchase VIT and take part in a revolution in the adult industry \u2014 the creation of an adult entertainment ecosystem in which everybody who accesses the platform will be rewarded.Here\u2019s how the crowdsale works. VIT uses Ethereum, a decentralized blockchain platform that runs smart contracts, to generate VIT proxy tokens to customers in exchange for ETH cryptocurrency paid out of customers\u2019 Ethereum wallets.It is important to note that buyers who want to participate in the VIT crowdsale MUST pay for their VIT out of an Ethereum wallet.A digital wallet is simply a method of storing your crytptocurrency and/or crypto tokens. Certain kinds of wallets support certain types of platforms. In order to buy VIT, you need to have an Ethereum-compatible wallet and load it up with the amount of ETH you want to use to buy VIT. There are several different Ethereum-compatible wallets available. Buyers who attempt to purchase VIT using an Exchange or any other type of wallet or funding source will lose the currency paid, so it\u2019s crucial to set up your Ethereum wallet before you try to buy.VIT smart contractsSales of VIT are driven by smart contracts. These are applications that define the rules and terms of an agreement or transaction, as well as automatically enforce those rules. A smart contract ensures that a transaction occurs exactly as agreed without any middleman needed.One of the smart contracts involved in the VIT sale is the ERC20 token, or the token contract. This governs the token itself, including managing transfers and other functions, based on globally agreed Ethereum-powered (ERC20) standards.Another smart contract runs the sale itself. The VIT sales contract holds proxy tokens for buyers once the buyers\u2019 ETH are paid. The VIT sales contract includes a unique refund functionality. After the crowdsale ends, buyers can either claim their proxy tokens, which are immediately released into the customer\u2019s Ethereum wallet, or the buyer can request a refund, and the original ETH paid will be refunded back into the customer\u2019s wallet and the refunded VIT tokens will revert to Vice industry.While the refund function will expire on June 28, 2018, buyers will be able to claim purchased tokens indefinitely. After the refund contract expires, purchasers will also be able to redeem their claimed proxy tokens for the native Vice Industry Tokens from Vicetoken.com.The refund function was introduced in order to offer early buyers the opportunity to use and experiment with the platform to ensure that the VIT network offers them value.Looking for more details about Vice Industry and the VIT?

Ethereum has a fair chance of becoming a scalable global platform for collaboration. However, while they are a first-mover, they may not achieve scalability first.To arrive at a platform for new economic systems will require a level of scalability that might honestly take Ethereum years to achieve. During that time, any number of other projects could eclipse it importantly in the scalability aspect; this is why it\u2019s so important.Increasingly Ethereum has off-chain techniques such as Plasma, Plasma Cash and State Channels. However, when even Vitalik Buterin says present day blockchain \u201csucks\u201d, you know today\u2019s public blockchains could be disrupted. Ethereum does decentralization better; however Silicon Valley and China can beat them to scalability without the decentralization aspect \u2014 to monetize the public blockchain model better.Ethereum has attracted developers to blockchain, built communities, facilitated blockchain startups to achieve viability and introduced many protocols into how we think of dApp development. The entire ecosystem of open-source software projects working on building different aspects of Ethereum is rather impressive.Smart Contract Languages (Solidity, Vyper)RPC Libraries (web3js, ethers, Nethereum)Development Tools (truffle, ganache, solc, solium)Ethereum has given us hope for things like open-source decentralized systems, though the scalability bottleneck appears rather serious for Ethereum\u2019s future sustainability. However, Ethereum is migrating its consensus protocol from proof-of-work to proof-of stake. It\u2019s trying to adapt. By 2020, its fate will be known. The next couple of years are critical.If Sharding is how Ethereum will realize the performance gains necessary to scale, it will take years!DfinityDfinity has raised $167 million according to Crunchbase, it\u2019s actually closer to $200 million. DFINITY is your classical copy cat, where it\u2019s taken many of the concepts of Ethereum and replicated them with a flashier brand. The preposterous analogies here are blindingly of the \u201cfake it till you make it\u201d variety. Cloud 3.0, The World Computer, Ethereum on Steroids, The NASA of blockchain \u2014 but in spite of the marketing gimmicks, the terminology of their stack is rather appealing.Dfinity proposes a decentralized cloud model. It sees itself as being similar to Ethereum but with fewer performance restrictions that will ultimately have unlimited capacity.Dfinity includes an innovative governance system called the Blockchain Nervous System (BNS) that is by design able to implement retroactive state changes without the need/option to fork.Dfinity aims to finalize computations at least 50X faster than on Ethereum, so it often compares itself to Ethereum as its baseline. Dfinity likes to invent terms and audaciously wants to be that neighborhood virtual computer in cyberspace that will support software systems, business applications and enterprise IT systems.Dfinity, for all its buzzword prowess, is probably one of the contenders to scale public blockchains in the race to scalability. However, in some respects Dfinity sees itself like a blockchain Cloud whereby it could improve on the traditional tech stack and one day perhaps rival AWS, Azure, Google Cloud. But then who knows, when it\u2019s calling itself an Internet Computer, akin to a blockchain supercomputer?Cardano\u2019s founder Charles Hoskinson.CardanoCardano is very well respected and sees itself as a technological platform that will be capable of running financial applications currently used every day by individuals, organisations and governments all around the world. Its academic roots are very strong with peer-reviewed quality.Cardano offers scalability and security through layered architecture and might be considered more mature than Ethereum and NEO. With an emphasis on scientific philosophy and peer-reviewed academic research, it\u2019s less gamified than EOS and is rooted as a second-generation blockchain.With a founder who was one of the original founders of Ethereum, he sees blockchain as the leading and dominant model of technology by 2030. With startups like Bakkt, indeed, the once visionary intersection of cryptocurrency and Wall Street appears to be manifesting.Cardano has ties in Hong Kong and Japan and a strong academic basis. With a lack of provisions for scalability he believes Ethereum is flawed and this is why Cardano too must be considered in the race of public blockchains to achieve scalability first.Cardano focus on solving problems ofScalabilityInteroperabilitySustainabilityIt definitely feels on point without being too gimmicky or trying to raise too much capital. Cardano\u2019s emphasis on philosophy and science feels credible in the sense of building a \u201ccollection of design principles, engineering best practices, and avenues for exploration.\u201dCardano sees scalability as a three-headed hydra:Transactions per second/ ThroughputNetworkData ScalingThe consensus mechanism of Cardano is called Ouroboros. It is a provably secure proof-of-stake algorithm that was peer reviewed back in 2017. Proof of stake will make the entire mining process virtual and replace miners with validators. Cardano is well underway to implementing how next-gen decentralization networks might work: for instance, Cardano is looking at a new type of technology called RINA, Recursive Inter-Network Architecture created by John Day.RINA\u2019s goal is to create a heterogeneous network which promises to give:PrivacyTransparencyScalabilityFor Data scaling Cardano is a firm believer that not everyone needs to see everything. The techniques that Cardano is looking into are:PruningSubscriptionsCompression.Cardano\u2019s work on Interoperability and side chains is also not to be overlooked. Cardano\u2019s vision is to create an \u201cinternet of blockchains\u201d and that\u2019s one that\u2019s compatible with the reality of a world with one foot in blockchain and the other in legacy systems.These guys are so new they don\u2019t even have a working website yet.Harmony ProtocolHarmony wants to build open consensus for 10 billion people. Again, here is a team with a plan to implement scalability and the engineering talents are experienced in companies such as Microsoft, Apple, Google and so forth.They have received seed money and come with new ideas on how scalability could occur. They seem aligned with how Waymo and automation will occur and are poised to align with it as the Harmony protocol was created to build an open market place on a Google scale for a decentralized economy.Scalability here means a merging with accelerating layers of the technology stack itself.1 \u2014 Transport network (Google\u2019s UDP, Bloom tables, 5G mobile)2 \u2014 Consensus protocol (Byzantine committees, acyclic graphs, monopolist fees)3 \u2014 System tooling (unikernels, multi-core in Rust, zero-copy streaming).What they lack in blockchain dev experience I think they make up for with a strong engineering-experienced team. They could grow up to be a serious rival of Dfinity which is in the same neighborhood. Their focus on scalability is a bit more grounded.For their Transport Network the way they will use Google\u2019s UDP (Google\u2019s User Datagram Protocol), notably known as QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) seems on point. This is also because QUIC improves the combination of different cases and achieves the latency of Zero Round-trip. Thus, broadcasting without the round-trip latency makes synchronization stronger and resistant to change and instability.They\u2019re aiming for all the right stuff:High throughoutLow LatencyLow-fee Consensus platformGlobal scale marketplace for digital assets and servicesAccording to Nick White, their testnet of 10,000 nodes and 25 shards achieved 10,184 transactions per second.They have been growing their team this summer and looking for exceptional talent. Their thought leadership has been pretty low key up until now, however a good starting point is this intro post. I just get a sense that this team will turn out to be something important in the landscape as their approach is highly cerebral and in tune with the best technology currently available.A quick look at their team inspires confidence. Their spirit of inclusion and entrepreneurship feels a bit more sincere than Dfinity\u2019s. They may not \u201ccare\u201d about decentralization the way the Ethereum community does, but they can solve the problem of scalability from a 2018 standpoint in a much more concrete way, able to develop a solution from what we already know now.Nervos can bring public blockchain to China in a way few projects can.NervosFinally we come to Nervos, one of my favorite newcomers to the public blockchain domain. Here we have a team that\u2019s incredibly experienced with some of China\u2019s top blockchain engineers.Their CKB and Cell model feels very original and highly adaptable to scalability factors.They have a ton of experience from when the chief architect built a permissioned blockchain called CITA, a fast and scalable blockchain for enterprise users. So their understanding of blockchain research, academia, enterprise and what\u2019s needed to connect the dots in a public blockchain is unparalleled.Being located with a team in China is also a huge advantage for funding purposes and collaboration with an existing blockchain community there. It\u2019s arguably a better place to be than Silicon or Crypto valley even as they increase their U.S. based community and marketing.Nervos Network is an underdog in this race, compared to some of the others on this list, but I predict they won\u2019t be for long. You don\u2019t have to look far to see the errors in Ethereum or NEO\u2019s model. Blockchain 3.0 platforms are designed to solve scalability right off the bat, and that\u2019s the point of the future of decentralized applications. For mass adoption to occur, scalability needs to be solved and transaction speed optimized.Ultimately the future of public blockchains that I think 2019 will reveal will have less to do with Ethereum 2.0 than it will an army of contenders to become the heir apparent of scalable decentralized blockchain. Satoshi Nakamoto would not want us to stop at Bitcoin or Ethereum, but keep evolving the paradigm. The world might need Cardano, Dfinity, Harmony and Nervos to push Ethereum to keep evolving and it if cannot, others will take its place.There are many smart talented people working on making Ethereum awesome, but Ethereum is not the end-all and the be-all of the future of public blockchains as I think we\u2019ll find out before 2020.", "responses": 19, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Ethereum", "Cryptocurrency", "Future", "Technology"]}, {"title": "Getting Started as an Ethereum Web Developer", "post_link": "https://medium.com/hackernoon/getting-started-as-an-ethereum-web-developer-9a2a4ab47baf?source=search_post", "author_name": "Alex Miller", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@asmiller1989", "publish_date": "2017-04-11", "last_modified_date": "2019-04-26", "readtime": "11.2", "claps": 1497, "voters": 475, "content": "Getting Started as an Ethereum Web DeveloperAlex MillerFollowApr 11, 2017 \u00b7 12 min readUPDATE: I have created a repo for you to play around with that showcases most of the stuff covered in this article.I routinely build web applications that use Ethereum and I think I take for granted the amazing toolset that I use every day. Our ecosystem is growing rapidly and I think a lot of newcomers are feeling overwhelmed. Ethereum is an amazing technology, but it is also nascent and there simply hasn\u2019t been enough time for expertise to sufficiently permeate. I want people to know that Ethereum development is actually very compatible with modern web developer workflows \u2014 it\u2019s relatively easy to integrate Ethereum functionality into any web application, and you can start today.Because I fancy myself a champion of Ethereum on a mission to show mainstream developers the light, I have decided to put a bunch of scattered knowledge into one place (not very decentralized, I know). You will of course need to consult the proper documentation at each step, but my hope is that this article will show you how everything, more or less, fits together.If you\u2019re ready to learn, please let me be your spirit guide. Come join the Ethereum ecosystem and help us conquer the world.Step 1: Get a blockchainThere are lots of clients to choose from, but I suggest not yet worrying about geth vs parity vs pyethapp (the up and coming python client \u2014 represent!). For everyone who just wants a freaking blockchain so they can start building stuff (e.g. you), I suggest testrpc for all your development needs. Once you have it installed, you can start it with:testrpcCongratulations, you now have a blockchain. Note that by default testrpc does not mine blocks, but the -b flag allows you to specify a block interval (e.g. 1 second). I like this configuration for a bunch of reasons I won\u2019t get into, but just keep in mind that it is available.Step 2: Talk to the blockchainOnce you have your blockchain spinning, you need a way to talk to it. You have probably already downloaded web3.js. If you haven\u2019t, you must be really new. Well, go ahead and make sure you have web3 installed, then open up a config.js file and put this in it:var web3 = require('web3');var web3_provider = 'http://localhost:8545';var _web3 = new web3();_web3.setProvider(new web3.providers.HttpProvider(web3_provider));exports.web3 = _web3;Any time you want to talk to the blockchain on your backend server, just do this:var config = require('./config.js');config.web3.eth.XThe X (i.e. whatever web3 API function you want) can be found here.Step 3: Write some smart contractsI\u2019ll save you some time here: you\u2019re going to be using solidity to write smart contracts. If you think smart contracting is scary, don\u2019t. For many applications, it\u2019s actually really easy as long as you follow one rule: keep your contracts simple.There are 2 reasons you want to always always always keep your contracts as absolutely stupid simple as is humanly possible:Every compute/storage operation costs gas, which equals ether, which equals money. We\u2019re talking the difference between paying $0.05 and $1.50 to call your contract. The point of Ethereum is not to replace your database (at least not in my opinion), so keep the logic short and the storage minimal.More complexity = more places for things to go wrong. This is bad when your code is responsible for people\u2019s money and can\u2019t be rolled back. Please take a minute to let that last sentence sink in.Okay, simple contracts \u2014 got it. Let\u2019s move on.Step 4: Deploy those smart contractsIf you haven\u2019t heard of truffle, you should definitely check that out now. I like to manage my tester contracts in a truffle directory. The neat thing about this is that you can easily work it into your testing framework. Consider this script in package.json:\"scripts\": {  \"test\": \"cd truffle && truffle deploy && truffle test ./myTruffleTest.js && cd .. && npm run myOtherTests\"}What this is doing is 1. deploying your contracts, 2. running your truffle test, 3. running your regular tests \u2014 all in the same script!Note that your truffle tests are \u201cspecial\u201d in that they inject a bunch of cool blockchainy stuff into your testing scope. There are a variety of ways to pass this information to the rest of your test suite. I personally use a truffle test to save the contract addresses into a config file and then import that config into my regular mocha tests. As long as I have the proper addresses, I can interact with my contracts in any test via web3.js. Anyway, you\u2019ll figure out what works best for you.Back to the main show. You can deploy your smart contract(s) by going to your truffle directory and typing:truffle deployNote that testrpc must be running in another window!This will print the address of your freshly deployed contract, which you will need later. As I mentioned, you can always save this address programmatically in a truffle test, but for now you can just copy and paste it into your config.js file:exports.contract_addr = '0xe73e8e0a4442e140aea87a4b150ef07b82492500'Step 5: Make a smart contract callNow that we have a contract, we need to call it. Okay this one is going to seem janky \u2014 we\u2019ll be calling contracts with pure hex strings. Sure there are libraries to make this easier, but when it comes to contract calls, I kick it old school. And remember, I am your sensei.The first thing to note is that everything must be in hex (see appendix for more details). Numbers, strings, etc. The second thing to note is that words in Ethereum are 256 bits. This means you need to left-pad everything with zeros to 64 characters. The third thing to note is that types must be declared canonically in the function definition.Okay this is getting really neckbeardy. Let\u2019s go through an example:function add(uint x, uint y) public constant returns (uint) {  return x + y;}Let\u2019s say you want to add 1 and 2. Here\u2019s how you call this function:1: Take the first 4 bytes of the keccak 256 hash of your tightly packed, canonical function definition.Say what? Well, I didn\u2019t make this up, but you can just type your function declaration into this website and take the first 8 characters. What do I mean by canonical? Well, in Ethereum there are canonical types and shorthand types (e.g. uint256 is uint\u2019s canonical type). I actually don\u2019t know where they\u2019re all defined, but check out the Ethereum ABI definition for examples as well as this post.Anyway, this is what our declaration looks like:add(uint256,uint256)Which returns the keccak256 hash:771602f7f25ce61b0d4f2430f7e4789bfd9e6e4029613fda01b7f2c89fbf44adOf which the first 4 bytes (8 characters) are:771602f72: Pad your parameters to 256 bitsThis one\u2019s a little easier to get a grasp on:x=1 is:0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001y=2 is:0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002And together they are:000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000023: Pack everything together and add a 0x prefixPretty self explanatory:0x771602f700000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000010000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002\u2014Now that we have our payload, we can call the contract with web3:var config = require('./config.js');var call = '0x771602f700000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000010000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002'var to = config.contract_addr;var res = config.web3.eth.call({ to: to, data: call });After that, you should get back 3 for res. Actually, you\u2019ll get a BigNumber object:res.toString()>'3'You should probably read this to learn more about why you should use BigNumbers throughout your app.Okay fine, you can use the library I was talking about earlier.Wait, we\u2019re not done yet! I have only just shown you how to call a contract. But what if you want to write to it (i.e. update state)? The above will not work! You need to sign a transaction with your private key, but before that, you need some ether.Step 6: Setup your accountLet\u2019s go back to truffle. In our test, we need to add something like this:var keys = require(`${process.cwd()}/../test/keys.json`);it('Should send me some ether.', function() {  assert.notEqual(keys.me.addr, null);  var eth = 1*Math.pow(10, 18);  var sendObj = {    from: accounts[0],    value: eth,    to: keys.me.addr  }    Promise.resolve(web3.eth.sendTransaction(sendObj))  .then(function(txHash) {    assert.notEqual(txHash, null);    return web3.eth.getBalance(keys.me.addr)  })  .then(function(balance) {    assert.notEqual(balance.toNumber(), 0);  })})Important note: we are actually sending 1 ether which is the same as 10^18 wei. We always make calls/transactions with wei values.Now, I\u2019m skipping a step here. You need to first get an Ethereum account, which is derived from a private/public keypair that you generate. I like using eth-lightwallet for key management on the backend. If you want more details/instructions on that, they are in the appendix.To keep things simple, let\u2019s just pretend I have this variable hardcoded in my ever growing config.js:exports.me = {  addr: \"0x29f2f6405e6a307baded0b0672745691358e3ee6\",  pkey: \"8c2bcfce3d9c4f215fcae9b215eb7c95831da0219ebfe0bb909eb951c3134515\"}Obligatory reminder: never share your private key, upload it to github, or publish it on Medium if there is or will ever be any money on it.Back to the test, you can see that ether is being moved from accounts[0] , which by default has a bunch of ether, to me.addr, which is in your config file.Step 7: Transacting with your smart contractsNow that your account has some ether, it\u2019s time to spend it. There are 3 ways to spend ether:Sending it to another address as valueCalling a contract function that updates the state of the network, which requires gas to incentivize the miner to process your update.Call a contract that updates state, but also accepts ether as payment (FYI there is a payable modifier in solidity) \u2014 value will be sent and you will also have to pay for gas.What we\u2019re going to do next falls into category #2. Suppose we have the following function that keeps track of a user\u2019s balance of something:function addUserBalance(uint balance)public returns (bool) {  if (!accounts[msg.sender]) { throw; }  if (accounts[msg.sender].balance + balance < accounts[msg.sender].balance) { throw; }  accounts[msg.sender].balance += balance;  return true;}Note the second if statement, which is necessary because adding and subtracting in solidity can lead to numerical overflow and underflow \u2014 be careful! Also note the undeclared msg object living in your function scope. This has all sorts of neat stuff you can reference in your function.When we call this function by sending a transaction, we are asking to update the global state of the network to say the following:The balance of msg.sender's account, within the scope of this contract, has been increased by balance.We don\u2019t have the power to update state ourselves, so we need a miner to do it for us. We pay him or her for this service with gas, which translates to ether.To appropriately call this function, we need to use ABI again:addUserBalance(uint256) --> 22526328 --> 0x225263280000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001And we use this data to form an unsigned transaction:var data = '0x225263280000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001';var nonce = config.web3.eth.getTransactionCount(keys.me.addr);var gasPrice = 20 * Math.pow(10, 9);var gasLimit = 100000;var txn = {  from: config.me.addr,  to: config.contract_address,  gas: `0x${gasLimit.toString(16)}`,  gasPrice: `0x${gasPrice.toString(16)}`,  data: data,  nonce: `0x${nonce.toString(16)}`,  value: '0x0'}As mentioned above, gas is required to make a transaction (i.e. update the state). gas * gasPrice is the amount of wei the miner can possibly spend to execute your transaction. If the operations cost more than what you provided, the transaction will not update the state and the miner will keep all your gas money. If less than the gas provided is used, you are refunded the remainder.If we submit this object to the network, it will fail because there has been no proof that I am actually authorizing this transaction. Who knows, some stranger could be updating my balance to 1 billion (although it\u2019s unclear why anyone would do that).Anyway, what I need to do is sign the transaction with my private key. Remember that old thing hanging out in your config file that I told you not to share with anyone? Do this with it:var Tx = require('ethereumjs-tx');var privateKey = Buffer.from(config.me.pkey, 'hex')var tx = new Tx(txn);tx.sign(privateKey);var serializedTx = tx.serialize();Here we are using one of my favorite libraries to sign a transaction object given your private key. This should return something like the following:0xf8aa808504a817c800830f424094a0f68379088f9aee95ba5c9d178693b874c4cd6880b844a9059cbb000000000000000000000000053b2188b0b100e68299708864e2ccecb62cdf0d000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000746a5288001ca01f683f083c2d7c741a1218efc0144adc1749125a9ca53134b06353a8e4ef72afa07c50fb59647ff8b8895b75795b0f51de745fa5987b985f7d1025eb346755bca0Now, finally, we can submit this to the blockchain via web3. It will return a transaction hash that is simply a hash of the transaction provided (this is, very importantly, not proof that the transaction was successful!)var txHash = config.web3.eth.sendRawTransaction(raw_txn);Which looks something like this:0xac8914ecb06b333a9e655a85a0cd0cccddb8ac627098e7c40877d27a130a7293Now there\u2019s one last step, which is strictly speaking optional, but important to verify that your transaction has been accepted and processed: getting your transaction receipt.var txReceipt = config.web3.eth.getTransactionReceipt(txHash);If this returns null your transaction was not picked up (perhaps you signed with the wrong private key?). If it\u2019s not null, there may still be various other clues that your transaction failed that I won\u2019t get into now.Okay, just one clue \u2014 if your gasUsed is equal to the total gas sent, it means your function call failed. This means either 1. you didn\u2019t provide enough gas and/or 2. your contract encountered a throw.And that\u2019s a wrap!ConclusionI know, that was a lot of stuff.If you\u2019re feeling overwhelemed, I suggest you take it slow and use this article as a reference. You will probably need to spend a lot of time at each step reading documentation and playing around.That said, what I\u2019ve described above is 80% of the battle. Once you\u2019ve mastered these things, I would personally consider you a capable Ethereum developer.If you\u2019re interested, start tinkering!

You can run it with plain old node keygen.js <account_name> and you should be good. I use this for test accounts, but you can reuse the functions if you need to e.g. automatically generate accounts.Hacker Noon is how hackers start their afternoons.

You can think of smart contracts as a set of rules governing something, which cannot be modified ever in the future. They allow a developer to write anything in the form of a smart contract that gets executed by the network. Consider the example:If A and B place a bet about the next day\u2019s weather, the bet can be carried out in a trustless manner using a smart contract. Both of them can submit their betting amounts to the smart contract. At a predefined time on the next day, the contract will make an API call to the Open Weather API to see if the weather is sunny or rainy. Depending on the weather, the total amount will be sent to either of the two.Because this contract is no more than a software program and gets executed on a stranger\u2019s computer, it had to be made sure that the programmer cannot exploit the stranger\u2019s computer or the whole network. To fix the problem, Ethereum came up with its native programming language \u2014 Solidity. Although the language is Turing-complete, which means any program can be written in it, there\u2019s still a steep learning curve \u2014 and the developer community is in its infancy.These two limitations have made Ethereum be perceived as merely an ICO platform, rather than a world computer.Besides these Ethereum-specific disadvantages, it also faces the problems of the blockchain in general \u2014 slow speed and no native identity on the blockchain. But blockchains are evolving \u2014 we are living in the first few years when the internet was invented. It\u2019s slow, expensive, clunky; but hey, it\u2019s the future!Is the future anywhere near?\u201cYou cannot escape the responsibility of tomorrow by evading it today.\u201d \u2014 Abraham LincolnAs a huge advocate of blockchain in general, I am quite excited by the research and development happening in the space. With recent developments, we are seeing new blockchains coming up in the industry that offer so much more: They make developers move to using these newer blockchains for building their decentralized apps and ICOs.I am particularly excited by development in the blockchains that allow general computations to happen in a decentralized manner. The newer generation of such blockchains offers much more than the ability to write smart contracts.Support for programming language\u201cA programming language is low level when its programs require attention to the irrelevant.\u201d \u2014 Alan PerlisWhen it comes to writing a smart contract, the biggest obstacle that I hear from the Ethereum developer community is the requirement to learn a new programming language. I agree that the syntax looks very similar to JavaScript, but it still is a different language and requires you to think of a problem with a different mindset.Tezos blockchain decided to go with a functional programming language for the smart contracts. Most developers are alien to functional programming and might find the learning curve steeper than Ethereum\u2019s Solidity.Another blockchain, NEO, promises to offer support for .Net and Java to begin with, and eventually will allow programs written in Python and Go on its platform. With these four languages supported by NEO, it will already serve about 90 percent of the developer community from the get-go.Qtum is another blockchain that allows developers to write Ethereum-like smart contracts, but using Bitcoin\u2019s UTXO format. In bitcoin, there\u2019s no concept of an account and balance. Instead of tracking every account\u2019s balance, the unspent transactions are tracked (the transactions that were sent to your wallet and are not spent yet). The sum of those transactions make up your balance. It is very efficient and lightweight to maintain these records as compared to accounts on an Ethereum-based model. Qtum thus allows for very lightweight smart contracts.It\u2019s interesting to see how different blockchains are adopting various programming paradigms for their blockchains. Some are targeted toward consumers and some toward large enterprises.Native blockchain identity\u201cEveryone thinks that a new place or a new identity will jumpstart a new life.\u201d \u2014 Caroline LeavittOn the Ethereum blockchain, your identity is the public key whose private key you own. Every smart contract you deploy gets its own public address (identity).Unlike the pseudonymous model of Ethereum, blockchains like NEO offer users a native identity that can be used across the apps on the blockchain. Imagine if the internet had allowed every user to have a native identity, then you\u2019d have never been required to create a separate one for every service you use on the internet.Some say blockchain is the new internet. There are several mental models in which to fit blockchain, and I, too, believe considering it as the new internet is not a bad analogy. A native identity on the blockchain will have a native identity that can be used to access anything that gets built on the blockchain.There are several teams working to solve the identity problem on blockchains. For instance, on Ethereum, Civic allows a user to record his/her identity that he/she can later use for other apps on the blockchain.I find blockchain-level native identity a worthy proposition because if there\u2019s no native identity, the teams that are solving the identity problem will make the ecosystem fragmented.Consensus protocol\u201cA genuine leader is not a searcher for consensus but a molder of consensus.\u201d \u2014 Martin Luther King, Jr.The current generation of blockchains gets criticized for how much energy it consumes to power the network. The costs are high because of the consensus method Bitcoin or Ethereum blockchain uses.In any blockchain, periodically all the nodes in the network will have to agree to the updated state of the system. Because the nodes are geographically distributed and are not always keeping track of every other node in the network, they would be required to sync themselves and agree upon the new state of the network.Currently, the most popular consensus method is proof of work, where every node tries to claim the updated state of the network by solving a cryptographic puzzle. Whoever solves it first gets to tell the network what the updated state is. Everyone agrees to it and proceeds ahead.The disadvantages of this method are that it is slow and expensive. There are several solutions to this problem, with their own pros and cons. While Ethereum is on its way to move consensus to proof of stake, Qtum and Tezos launched with a version of a proof of stake consensus protocol from the start. Interesting is that Tezos and Qtum go a step ahead and offers a decentralized way of governance to adopt any major upgrades to the protocol. Every major upgrade is proposed and voted upon, making the hard forks theoretically rare.On the other hand, NEO uses a delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance (dBFT) consensus mechanism that makes it possible to sync up the network a lot quicker without spending a lot of energy. It supports up to 10,000 transactions per second as compared to Ethereum\u2019s 15 transactions per second.Blockchain is the future \u2014 but how does the future look?Google wasn\u2019t the first search engine, and Facebook wasn\u2019t the first social network \u2014 they were the best ones.We might see a similar trend when it comes to the blockchain world. Bitcoin and Ethereum have shown us something that we considered impossible before. But they are far from being perfect.While blockchain is the future, I do not believe the future is what we are living today. We are living among the experiments. What we see around us might be in ruins tomorrow. What we get as our future might not have been invented yet.With hopes still high and a sharp eye on the industry, I am waiting for the ultimate blockchain. Will it be Ethereum? Or NEO? Or Qtum? Or Tezos? Or something else? I don\u2019t know. For now, I am excited to witness one of the largest shifts a human life can live through. Even if the future does not appear to be near, the future is not far either.Thanks for reading! :) If you liked it, please support by clapping \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb and sharing the post.

SpencerFollowSep 4, 2018 \u00b7 5 min readThe fate of cryptocurrencies is dynamic, the roadblocks to ETH are considerable. Last year we loved to speculate about Bitcoin, this year we are talking about Ethereum a bit more, it\u2019s only natural. This is also since decentralized app platforms and their interactions with cryptocurrencies and altcoins are more intimately tied to the evolution of public blockchains than niche coins such as privacy, stable or crypto assets.Ethereum is like a promise to the future that decentralization will one day actually matter.There\u2019s been talk lately that ETH the asset will inevitably be worth nothing one day, that its collapse is inevitable. That\u2019s an amusing dialogue since it forces us to consider just how fast things are moving. ETH has problems to mass adoption:ScalabilityTransactions are too expensiveThe technology is getting oldNewer more scalable blockchains will eclipse itDevelopers will migrate to more \u201cshiny\u201d ecosystemsIt\u2019s feasible in 2018 to talk about how many of the things Ethereum set out to do, others will do better. Ethereum has a massive community and is decentralization-orientated in a way that feels much more genuine than many other projects; however that\u2019s not to say that its value as ETH is eternal.It doesn\u2019t run unstoppable applications. It\u2019s created a shared global infrastructure for ICOs, something we must admit has damaged the reputation of crypto to be synonymous with fraud and scams, in dire ways. Bitcoin purists have many valid points for being critical of Ethereum. It\u2019s scaled \u201cmistrust\u201d, probably more than it\u2019s scaled trust and used blockchain to create a new world.Blockchain is and crypto is in early garden modeAs TechCrunch points out, there\u2019s no future for GAS in its current state. It\u2019s expensive AF. ETH fees are not a sustainable model as they work circa 2018. The Gas metaphor is legit but an ugly model as the same time:The Ethereum network is like a shared car. When a contract wants to be driven by the shared car, the car uses up fuel, which you have to pay the driver for. How much gas money you owe depends on how far you had to be driven and how much trash you left in the car. \u2014 TechCrunchBut we need blockchain platforms and dApps with the equivalent of self-driving and electric cars. We need clean energy. Is Ethereum ever going to be that model? In 2018 as dominant a position as ETH has, relative to other cryptocurrencies, we can\u2019t say it\u2019s so, or will be so. The ERC-20 won\u2019t be relevant forever, that\u2019s a given.Crypto has a regulation problem, there\u2019s a lot of manipulation in the space. Smart contracts are just in their infancy. Ethereum is the first-mover, not the end-game of this stuff. It\u2019s inspiring, rather than a delightful product. That\u2019s okay, that\u2019s how technology works and how innovation happens.But is Etheruem the solution to cryptoeconomics and economic abstraction obstacles?Lack of software support for economic abstractionDifficulty in pricing many tokensExistence of contracts not tied to tokens (speculative)Need for ETH for Proof-of-StakeIn the evolution of our understanding of cryptoeconomics, we can probably do better than ETH. It\u2019s what we compare public blockchains and some ecosystems to, (like how DFINITY chose to copy their branding lingo), but is it the end-game of public blockchains? Certainly not.ETH is in some respects, I think, a compromise between Vitalik Buterin and Vlad Zamfir, which is not necessarily a bad thing but doesn\u2019t solve all problems of economic abstraction. This and the scaling issue mean basically that ETH is vulnerable to disruption.Whatever issues in software support, market pricing, non-token contracts and PoS ETH might have, it\u2019s certainly still the dominant model in public blockchain cryptoeconomics today. We should be critical of the standard bearer, that\u2019s only fair. But then decentralization advocates have a way of turning crypto influencers into prophets. Google may have tried to hire him as an intern recently, but we have to remember he\u2019s just some mid-20s person who is dedicated to the development of the blockchain.Do we Need More Crypto Prophets?We have Satoshi Nakamoto, do we really need to evangelize the personal brands of more crypto influencers? Does Vitalik Buterin really want that kind of scrutiny and influence? Do we want him to think, like Musk or Trump, that Twitter is somewhat important to his legacy?Vitalik Buterin (Ethereum Foundation) at TechCrunch Disrupt SF 2017The papers he works on with E. Glen Weyl, may turn out to be his most important contributions to humanity: Liberal Radicalism: Formal Rules for a Society Neutral Among Communities.ETH felt very new in 2017, but we have a tendency to get wrapped up too much in the cult of crypto. Bitcoin is a perfect example of this. The utility of these things as the founding crypto Bitcoin and the founding ecosystem Ethereum, is that they are inspirational and will not live forever.The current crypto marketplace has attracted a lot of free-riders, scammers, profiteers, pump-and-dump investors, shitcoins and regulatory hoodwinkers, and Ethereum is at least somewhat responsible for this. If Technology as a whole has trust issues, it\u2019s nothing in 2018 compared to the trust issues crypto has. In an era defined by misinformation, cyber hacking and fraud online, being skeptical is the least we can do.Free-riders are people or businesses that profit from the under-provision of public goods. While Vitalik Buterin explores this in his recent paper with Microsoft researcher Glen Weyl and Ph.D. of economics at Harvard Zo\u00eb Hitzig, the irony is ETH is being exploited by such types. So much for decentralization guys. ETH\u2019s ethereal value is a cryptoeconomics and decentralized use-case and obstacle in and of itself.TechCrunch argues that in a stateless ecosystem, replacing ETH is a Pareto Improvement (i.e., all parties are better off). That\u2019s an interesting interpretation to me. ETH is a success in terms of developer opt-in and public blockchain enthusiasm, but for technical reasons it does appear to be flawed. Ethereum\u2019s contribution to to the evolution of cryptoeconomics may or may not be important, it\u2019s too soon to tell.When the cryptocurrency entrepreneur Jeremy Rubin wrote the TechCrunch article where he outlines and stipulates that the price of ETH is bound to plummet it was nice to see that Vitalik Buterin agreed in a response on Reddit, \u201cIn Ethereum as it presently exists, this is absolutely true.\u201d Timeless Ethereum, immortal Bitcoin, what are we going to do with you?", "responses": 31, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Ethereum", "Cryptocurrency", "Future", "Economics"]}, {"title": "WTF is Ethereum?", "post_link": "https://medium.com/hackernoon/wtf-is-ethereum-c65e0d67ac09?source=search_post", "author_name": "Mohit Mamoria", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@mohitmamoria", "publish_date": "2017-08-14", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-12", "readtime": "8.92", "claps": 6373, "voters": 939, "content": "WTF is Ethereum?The ultimate guide to understand why Ethereum is not just another cryptocurrency.Mohit MamoriaFollowAug 14, 2017 \u00b7 9 min readAlthough \u2018Bitcoin\u2019 and \u2018Ethereum\u2019 are terms that are often paired together, the reality is that they are vastly different. The only thing Ethereum shares with Bitcoin is that it\u2019s a cryptoasset running on top of blockchain.Instead of being just a cryptocurrency, like Bitcoin, Ethereum also has features which effectively makes it a huge decentralized computer.To understand Ethereum, one must understand how blockchain works. If you already understand it, or have already read my ultimate guide to understand blockchain, feel free to go directly to the next section.By the way, I am curator of a weekly newsletter, Unmade, which delivers one idea from the future to your inboxes.What is a blockchain?A blockchain, simply put, is a database. It\u2019s an ever growing database of certain kind of data and has quite remarkable properties:Once data is stored in the database, it can never be modified or deleted. Every record on a blockchain is permanent for eternity.No single individual or organization maintains the database; several thousand individuals do, and everyone has a copy of the database with themselves.To understand how several people are able to keep their copies of the database in sync with everyone else, imagine there are ten individuals in a network. Everyone is sitting with an empty file folder and an empty page in front of them. Whenever anyone does something important in the network, like transferring money, they announce it to everyone in the network.Everyone makes a note of the announcement on their pages until the page is filled. When it does, everyone has to seal the contents of the page by solving a mathematical puzzle. Solving the mathematical puzzle ensures that everyone\u2019s page had same contents and that they can never be modified. Whoever does it first, gets rewarded with some amount of cryptocurrency.Note: Want to know how exactly the process is carried out? Read the ultimate guide to understand blockchain.Once the page is sealed, the page is added to the file folder, a new page is brought out and the process continues forever.BlockchainAs time passes, these pages (blocks) that contain important records (transactions) are added to the folder (chain), thus forming the database (blockchain).What does a blockchain store?A blockchain can be used to store any kind of data, and the kind of data a blockchain stores, gives it its value. Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain stores the records of financial transactions, therefore, making it analogous to a currency like dollars or pounds. Bitcoins serve no additional purpose than what dollars serve. Ethereum is different.Ethereum is not merely a currency like dollars, pounds or bitcoin. Ethereum has a purpose higher than just being a currency. Ethereum is this:Ethereum is basically a huge computer! However it\u2019s an extremely slow one \u2014 about five to 100 times slower than regular computers today \u2014 and very expensive. The \u2018Ethereum computer\u2019 has about the same power as one of the rare 90\u2019s smartphones; so it can\u2019t really do much more than some very trivial things.That doesn\u2019t really sound so impressive, so why is there so much hype around Ethereum? Well, that\u2019s a really good question. Ethereum is taking the world by storm because it\u2019s a completely decentralized computer that is distributed across the globe. Understanding how Ethereum\u2019s blockchain works will reveal how it acts like a world computer.How does Ethereum work?Like any other blockchain, Ethereum needs several thousand people running a software on their computers to power the network. Every node (computer) in the network runs something called Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Think of EVM as a operating system that understands and executes the software written in Ethereum specific programming language. The software/apps executed by Ethereum Virtual Machine are called \u2018smart contracts.\u2019To get anything done on this world computer, you need to pay a price. However, you don\u2019t pay it in regular currency like dollars or pounds. Instead, everything has to be paid with a cryptocurrency native to the network, called ether. Ether is exactly like bitcoin except that it can also be used to pay for executing smart contracts on Ethereum.A human being and a smart contract are both seen as users on Ethereum. Whatever a human user can do, a smart contract can do too, and then some.Smart contracts act exactly like any other human user in the network. Both of them can send and receive ether just like any other currency.But unlike human users, smart contracts can also execute a predefined computer program to perform various actions when triggered. To understand the power of a smart contract, let\u2019s consider an example.Power of smart contractsImagine you and I place a bet about tomorrow\u2019s weather. I bet that it\u2019ll be sunny tomorrow while you bet it\u2019ll be rainy. We agree that the loser has to give the winner $100. How can we do this and ensure that the loser will keep his promise? I can think of three distinct ways:1. Trust each otherThe simplest way to do this would be to trust each other. If we\u2019ve been friends for a long time now, trusting each other is pretty easy. I know where you live and you know all kinds of embarrassing stuff about me. But things get more difficult if we\u2019re complete strangers. You have no reason to trust me and I have no reason to trust you.2. Sign a legal agreementAnother plausible way is to formulate our bet as a legal agreement. We\u2019ll both sign an agreement that defines all the terms of our bet in detail \u2014 including what happens if the loser violates the agreement.The agreement would makes us legally obligated to pay the winner, but it wouldn\u2019t serve any practical purpose because forcing the agreement through the legal route would be more expensive than what the bet was worth.3. Get help from a mutual friendWe could find a mutual friend who we both trust and we\u2019d both give him/her $100 each for safekeeping. The nextday, he/she would check the weather and give the total $200 to whoever won the bet. Simple and easy, except that it isn\u2019t: What if the trusted friend runs away with $200?Now we have three different ways of doing the bet but each option has its shortcomings. Because we are strangers, we cannot trust each other. Forcing a legal agreement will be so expensive that it wouldn\u2019t be practically feasible. Getting help from a mutual friend brings up the question of trust again.Ethereum\u2019s smart contract can save the day in such a situation. A smart contract is like the trusted mutual friend but written in code. Ethereum allows us to write a software that accepts ether worth $100 from both of us, and then the next day, uses the open weather API to check the weather and transfer the total ether worth of $200 to the winner.Once a smart contract has been written it cannot be edited or altered in any way. Therefore, you can be sure that whatever the contract dictates, it will be executed no matter what.But how is a smart contract executed? And how does it relate to blockchain?How does smart contract relate to blockchain?Whenever a smart contract is executed, it records the information about the execution on a block as a transaction. On a very high level, a transaction on Ethereum blockchain looks like this:The fields are self explanatory except the last one. The \u2018data\u2019 field is what gives Ethereum its unique power. The \u2018data\u2019 field is used to record creation and execution of smart contracts as a transaction. Any given block on the Ethereum blockchain can contain three kind of transactions:1. Regular transfers of ether from one user to a human userThese are the regular bitcoin-like transactions in the network. If you send ether directly to your friend the data field will be left empty.2. Transfers of ether from one user to no oneWhen a transaction without a recipient is made, it means that the purpose of the transaction is to create a smart contract in the network using the contents present in the \u2018data\u2019 field. The \u2018data\u2019 field contains the software code that will be made to act like any other user in the network.3. Transfers of ether from a user to a smart contractWhenever a user (or a smart contract) wants to execute a smart contract, he/she/it is required to make a transaction to the smart contract and put the instructions for the execution in the \u2018data\u2019 field.Just like in any other blockchain, whenever any of the three events mentioned above happen, it\u2019s announced to the whole network and everyone makes a note of it. In addition to making note of it, each node also executes the instructed smart contract to bring the state of their EVM in sync with the rest of the network.Each node executes a piece of software, thus, making the whole network act as a giant (but slow) distributed computer. Every tiny execution is then stored on the blockchain to make it permanent.Wait, I\u2019ve heard about something called Gas \u2014 what\u2019s that?I told you that the user using a smart contract must pay a certain price to execute it. This price is paid to the node that actually spends memory, storage, computation and electricity to execute the smart contract.To calculate the prices of smart contracts, every statement has an assigned cost to it. For example, if you execute a statement that uses the node\u2019s memory, those type of statements have a specific cost. If you execute a statement that uses the node\u2019s disk storage, those kind of statements have a specific cost attached to them. The unit in which the cost is defined is called Gas. Eventually, Gas is converted to ether using an exchange rate.Whenever you execute a smart contract, you have to define the maximum Gas to be consumed. The execution will stop either when the execution is completed or when the Gas Limit is reached. This is done to avoid infinite loops in smart contracts, preventing the program getting stuck executing a set of statements repeatedly without proceeding further.Such situations occur because of programmer\u2019s carelessness. With every repetition, some of the assigned Gas will be used, thus making any infinite loop a finite one. It doesn\u2019t make any sense for a node to be stuck in execution because of a programmer\u2019s mistake. The concept of Gas solves this problem.And that, ladies and gentleman, is EthereumEthereum isn\u2019t just a cryptocurrency to be traded; its real value lies in its purpose. Ethereum\u2019s purpose is to allow the owner to use the distributed world computer that several thousand nodes are powering.Of course, because every tiny statement has to be executed by every node in the network, the decentralized, distributed computer becomes slow and expensive. But slow compared to what? The faster but centrally controlled servers.To enjoy the lower costs of using a centralized computer, we give them the power to control us. If the central computer (server) goes down or gets hacked, it takes down with it all the clients attached to it. A decentralized computer will only go down if every single node goes down, making it a computer that will always be available. Wherever there\u2019s internet, there\u2019s Ethereum.\u2014About the authorMohit Mamoria is the CEO of godtoken.org and editor of a weekly newsletter, Unmade, which delivers one startup idea from the future to your inboxes.Have feedback?

And despite efforts from digital rights owners and sellers, the problem still persists today:1. Music FilesSome music re-sellers, such as Apple, embed Digital Rights Management (\u201cDRM\u201d) code into digital music to inhibit their transfer. But DRM-free copyrighted music files can still be shared illegally between individuals.2. Airline TicketsAirline tickets are generally non-transferable, and it is virtually impossible for a person who can not make a flight to sell it to another person.3. Live Event TicketsAfter an event creator sells a ticket, it is virtually impossible to regulate anything about the secondary ticket market \u2014 creating an opportunity for bots, brokers and scalpers to jack up prices and sell illegal duplicates.Enter Ethereum Quantum ProtocolsThe Ethereum blockchain can solve these problems by combining ERC-721 non-fungible tokens with ERC-20 fungible tokens in a system I call a \u201cQuantum Protocol.\u201dWhat Are ERC-721 ContractsERC-721 tokens are an untapped resource in the Ethereum protocol. The most well-known project to use them so far is CryptoKitties. CryptoKitties created new digital assets, each of which was unique, and can therefore only be represented with non-fungible contracts such as ERC-721\u2019s. High demand for Cryptokitties bogged down the Ethereum blockchain, demonstrating the limitation of ERC-721\u2019s as a tradable token.But focusing on CryptoKitties misses the whole point of ERC-721 tokens. The project barely tapped into the real functionality of ERC-721 tokens. ERC-721\u2019s allow each individual contract to have different characteristics. This is unlike ERC-20 tokens that, like a currency, do not allow for any variability.You don\u2019t need to invent new asset classes when there are already millions of examples of real-world uniquely identified digital assets that do have value, yet struggle with problems associated with ownership, use and transfer. Real-world digital assets that could be represented with ERC-721 tokens are live event tickets, airline tickets, digital music downloads and many others.How Quantum Protocols Can WorkUsing non-fungible ERC-721 tokens, you can solve the problems of proof of ownership, fraud prevention and transfer of ownership of digital assets. But in order to truly solve these problems, you have to do two things:1. Keep the ERC-721 Smart Contract Logic Lightweight:To prevent the system overload that CryptoKitties caused, you must build a standard protocol that limits the amount of information embedded into the smart contract. To do this, a separate metadata layer is created that stores and regulates non-essential information related to the asset.CryptoKitties was unregulated, and tokens could be created that were so large they bogged down the entire Ethereum blockchain. You can still encode a powerful amount of data in a limited ERC-721 token, such as a digital fingerprint, and a transfer protocol that sends transaction fees back to the creator, and access to additional perks or privileges, etc. But the system must set limitations on the total data capacity of each token to ensure fast transactions.2. Make non-fungible ERC-721 tokens interchangeable with fungible ERC-20 tokens, which can be easily bought and sold:You could do this with Ethereum itself or any of the tokens built on it, like Metal, or Binance or Tron, but you could also create your own native ERC-20 token. This could allow any company to create a marketplace for the ERC-721s that they issue, where they are bought and sold using their own native ERC-20 tokens. That would give them a powerful way to fund their project and also incentivize activity in the marketplace they create.This \u201cQuantum Protocol,\u201d \u2014 the combination of ERC-721s with a native ERC-20 token \u2014 would support any number of use cases. And it provides a way for each project to earn legitimate income from regular business functions surrounding their application. By creating a safer, trustless marketplace for digital assets that previously had all kinds of problems with security and fraud, you provide value, and you would be able to earn money on transaction fees, for example.3. To combine the whole system, use a trustless consensus protocol to ensure that the system remains decentralized:In order to ensure that the integrity of the ERC-721\u2019s and ERC-20\u2019s remain intact, the metadata layer must be regulated by a consensus protocol so no new information can impact on existing assets, unless agreed upon by the consensus protocol. This way we can make sure that we do not have a central point of failure, malicious actor, or corrupt authority manipulating data in the metadata or application layer.Quantum Protocols can become the next evolution for blockchain.

In July, a hacker was able to steal $31M of Ether by exploting a bug found in Parity\u2019s wallets. Today, we have the worst hack yet, only this time, the stakes are even bigger and it is all just one big fuck-up.Two days ago, a user named \u2018devops199\u2019 opened an issue on Parity\u2019s Github, titled \u201canyone can kill your contract\u201d, seemingly wanting to let Parity, a company that provides smart contracts for users of the Ethereum network, know about a vulnerability in their smart contract.The smart contract that he was referring to, concerns a \u2018multi-signature-contract\u2019, which is used by a large amount of people as a \u2018digital wallet\u2019 to safely store their Ethereum. Apparently, this wallet had a \u2018bug\u2019 in its code. The bug, or, better said, security vulnerability, allowed Devops199 to make himself one of the \u2018owners\u2019 of the contract. This gave him the permission to do pretty much anything.What Devops199 did then, might just be one of the most expensive mistakes ever made:He \u2018killed\u2019 the contract.Essentially, he deleted the function of the smart contract that allowed the owners of the Ethereum to transfer their Ethereum. He locked the Ethereum up in the contract, rendering it completely useless \u2014 forever. Still, it seems like he did not quite understand what had just happened.\u201cWil ether transfer by owners work?\u201dNo\u2026 No it won\u2019t. You pretty much just deleted a f*ck load of money.Essentially, everyone who used this multi-sig wallet, can no longer access their Ethereum anymore. Estimations of how much Ethereum was actually in these contracts range from $150 million USD to $300 million USD.Parity, who also had their multi-sig wallets hacked in Juli, issued a \u2018Security Alert\u2019 once again, stating:\u201cWe very much regret that yesterday\u2019s incident has caused a great deal of stress and confusion amongst our users and the community as a whole, especially with all the speculation surrounding the issue. We continue to investigate the situation and are exploring all possible implications and solutions.\u201dThe last thing that we heard from Devops199:Providing a solutionIt should be noted that the Ethereum itself is not actually completely deleted. It still exists; it can simply not be accessed.Imagine that 280 million USD is stored in a deposit box. Somehow, a random guy was able to walk into the bank and say he was the owner of the security box. He was handed full access without a problem and subsequently permanently deleted the key to the deposit box. This key, was completely unique and can in no way be recreated again.At least, not under the rules of the network. There is, however, a solution to this problem. One that is pretty controversial.When the DAO, a decentralized investment vehicle, was hacked earlier this year, the situation was fixed with a \u2018hard fork\u2019. The Ethereum foundation released a new version of their client, in which they had injected new transactions to \u2018steal\u2019 the Ether back from the hacker controlled smart contracts. Of course, technically these new transactions were against the rules of the Ethereum network, but as they were hard-coded into the Ethereum clients, the \u201crules\u201d were specifically changed to allow these (and only these!) otherwise rule-breaking transactions.However, when the decision was made to hard fork the Ethereum network to recover the funds lost during the DAO hack, a part of the network did not agree with the decision. Those who did not agree with the provided solution, believe that \u2018Code is Law\u2019, and this change is illegal. As such, they kept using the \u2018original\u2019 software instead. Suddenly, there were 2 versions of Ethereum: Ethereum, and Ethereum Classic.Ethereum Classic still exists to this day, and at the time of writing, it\u2019s market capitalization is about $1.3 billion USD, whereas the \u2018forked\u2019 Ethereum chain (the one that reverted the hack) is worth around $30 billion USD.It is very doubtful that the Ethereum network will opt for a hard fork again, seeing the controversy it caused last time. No doubt, Ethereum classic would benefit as a result. After all, where is the monetary limit for the Ethereum foundation to advocate for a quick fix that goes against the rules of their own network?Edit: The original version of this piece had a mistake in it. Thanks to Rene Schneider for correcting me on it.Criticizing Ethereum, again.It might be time to take a step back and re-think the design of smart contracts. This is not the first time a bug in one of these contracts led to gigantic sums of money being compromised. The Ethereum Foundation likes to brag that Ethereum, as a smart contract platform, is \u2018turing-complete\u2019, meaning that pretty much anything can be coded and deployed on top of it. So far, this particular choice of design has resulted in more than half a billion dollar being compromised in one way or the other.Turing-completeness consistently leads to vulnerabilities, as a contract is naturally only as good as its developer. Ask any developer about how often they accidentally write bugs into their code, with or without noticing, and you might understand why the whole concept of un-audited \u2018turing-complete\u2019 smart contracts is terribly dangerous when there is this much money at stake. Design choices have their consequences, and at some point it is time to re-evaluate them. For example, it might make sense for a smart contracting platform to only allow the deployment of \u2018pre-vetted\u2019 smart contracts, that are made and audited by professionals.Of course, that is a very centralized process in a decentralized system. And sure, there are many trade-offs in the meta-design of a smart contract platform. But these trade-offs are worth thinking about, because Ethereum will always be plagued by security issues if nothing changes.Supporters of Ethereum will say that I should not blame the platform for the mistakes made by smart contract developers and that\u2019s a valid point to some degree. However, let\u2019s not forget that Parity is not run by some unknown, incompetent boy in his puberty, deploying his first smart contracts. No, it is founded Gavin Wood himself, one of the co-founders of Ethereum.If even his smart contracts consistently have such flaws, how secure will the majority of Turing-complete smart contracts be in the future?About the Author:Thijs Maas is a law student with a healthy obsession for the legal challenges that arise in relation to the wave of innovation brought by distributed ledger technologies.

Please see my beginner\u2019s guide to Ethereum for those new to this concept entirely. Ethereum tokens are simply digital assets that are being built on top of the Ethereum blockchain. They benefit from Ethereum\u2019s existing infrastructure instead of developers having to build an entirely new blockchain. They also strengthen the Ethereum ecosystem by driving demand for ether, the native currency of Ethereum, needed to power the smart contracts. This beginner\u2019s guide should help those who are new to digital assets to understand Ethereum tokens at a high level and how they are different than Ethereum.ComparisonEthereum is a platform that can be used to create any arbitrary smart contract including smart contracts that represent digital assets called Ethereum tokens. This is similar to the App Store providing a platform for iOS apps with some apps issuing their own digital currencies that are used within the game or system. However, with Ethereum there is no centralized entity like Apple that controls what gets added to the App Store. Anyone can create a token on top of Ethereum.Ethereum tokens can represent anything from a physical object like gold (Digix) to a native currency used to pay transaction fees (Golem). In the future, tokens may even be used to represent financial instruments like stocks and bonds. The properties and functions of each token are entirely subject to its intended use. Tokens can have a fixed supply, constant inflation rate, or even a supply determined by a sophisticated monetary policy. Tokens can be used for a variety of purposes such as paying to access a network or for decentralized governance over an organization.Tokens are often issued to the public through a crowd sale called an initial coin offering (ICO). The creators of the token will issue the token to others in exchange for ether and sometimes bitcoin and other digital currencies. There have been many ICOs recently and in a short time they have completely changed the way projects are funded. There is no requirement that tokens must be well distributed, although if you are building a decentralized application ideally you want the tokens to be owned by as many people as possible.Chart from thecontrol.coThere are multiple resources that can walk you through the process of creating a token and that explain how tokens work on a technical level. For example, Token Factory provides a simple user interface that allows you to create your own Ethereum token with custom parameters.Similar to bitcoin and ether, Ethereum tokens are also tracked on the blockchain which is the public ledger of all transactions that have occurred. This is because Ethereum tokens are just a specific type of smart contract that live on the Ethereum blockchain.Aragon\u2019s token tracked on Etherscan.ioAmong the largest Ethereum tokens by market cap are Augur\u2019s REP and Golem\u2019s GNT. Both projects are in development and have a combined market cap of about $450 million. I\u2019ll briefly go over how each of them work to provide a better understanding of the vastly different functions an Ethereum token can have.AugurAugur is a decentralized prediction market co-founded by Joey Krug and Jack Peterson. Prediction markets allow users to bet on the outcome of different events and can also be used for hedging purposes. For example, if you own 1 bitcoin that is worth $2,000 and want to hedge that holding, you can bet that the price of bitcoin will be below $2,000 by a certain date. That way if the price of bitcoin goes up your holdings will be more valuable but if it goes down you will offset your losses through the prediction market. There is no centralized source that reports on the outcome of events. This mitigates the risk of a corrupt reporter but also creates a need for a decentralized reporting source.Augur issued an Ethereum token called Reputation (REP). There is a fixed supply of 11 million REP tokens in existence, 80% of which were sold through a crowd sale raising $5.3 million. These tokens are used for reporting on the outcome of prediction market events. All active REP holders are required to report on the outcome of randomly selected events. This maintains the decentralized reporting pool needed to settle the outcome of Augur\u2019s prediction markets. As a reward for providing this critical reporting function, REP holders receive half of all transaction fees generated by prediction markets on the platform. If someone tries to lie and report on the outcome incorrectly then they will get penalized by having to give up some of their REP. In addition if the majority of REP holders are dishonest then people would not want to use Augur and the value of REP goes down. This incentivizes people to act honestly in the Augur system.GolemGolem is a project headed by Julian Zawistowski that allows people to rent out their spare computing power to others. The idea is that by creating a worldwide supercomputer, computing power will become less costly and more accessible to everyone.Golem issued an Ethereum token called Golem Network Token (GNT). There is a fixed supply of 1 billion GNT in existence, 82% of which were sold through a crowd sale raising $8.6 million. These tokens are required for interacting with the Golem network and is the currency used as payment when renting computing power. Since there is a limited supply of tokens for accessing this network if more people want to use Golem then the value of GNT increases. This theoretically aligns the incentives of people holding GNT with those using it.ERC20 tokenYou may hear the Ethereum community refer to ERC20 tokens. The initial ERC20 page \u201cdescribes standard functions a token contract can implement.\u201d ERC20 is a standard interface for tokens. ERC20 tokens are simply a subset of Ethereum tokens. In order to be fully ERC20 compliant the developer needs to incorporate a specific set of functions into their smart contract that at a high level will allow it to perform the following actions:get the total token supplyget the account balancetransfer the tokenapprove spending the tokenERC20 allows for seamless interaction with other smart contracts and decentralized applications on the Ethereum blockchain. Tokens that have some but not all of the standard functions are considered to be partially ERC20 compliant and can still be easy for external parties to interact with depending upon which functions are missing.ResourcesThere are many existing and upcoming Ethereum tokens.

Lock up CoinsLet Profits Run. Cut Losses. Watch 7d Price Change not 24h or 1hICOs are a Great Opportunity. Do Your Own Research.Research Micro-Caps that might rise by Orders of Magnitude. (I like KucoinShares $KCS. Buy at Kucoin Exchange.)Trade both ways by going short on margin. Sell Bitcoin on margin at BitMEX.Rule 1: Build the Portfolio on BitcoinBitcoin is the mother lode. It has been good to me and will always form the main part of my crypto portfolio.Those (mainly low-income copy & paste journalists) claiming Bitcoin is in a bubble are too lazy and/or stupid to become informed. There is no Bitcoin bubble for these reasons.GrowthBitcoin has had phenomenal growth in its price and MCap since inception. If we exclude other cryptoassets, Bitcoin has been the best performing asset in the world every year since 2009 through to December 2017 with the exception of 2014. It has beaten all global currencies, equities, commodities, bonds, ETFs, real estate throughout that period. Bubbles are by definition short-lived, they do not keep bubbling for eight years.As a result it has achieved a MCap of $56 billion and this place in a global table of iconic assets.Trading VolumesVolumes indicate the liquidity of an asset. The greater the liquidity the easier it is to buy and sell, even when there is turmoil, and the lower the Bid-Offer spread and therefore the cost of trading. You want to avoid assets with tiny liquidity as when the shit hits the fan it will be costly to exit. Bitcoin has world-class liquidity. I run a crypoasset analysis site named Blocklink.info. Here is a screen-grab of the most liquid assets in the world.Source: Blocklink.info. Volumes for cryptoassets are fetched from the Coinmarketcap API using the CRYPTOFINANCE Google Sheets Add-On. Volumes for stocks come from Google Finance. You can check the US stocks volume at the NASDAQ site.Bitcoin\u2019s trading volume is up there with the great iconic American stocks.Bitcoin\u2019s price will continue to be volatile, but Bitcoin is travelling along a secular bull trend road, and that spectacular volume is not going to evaporate overnight.Transaction FeesEvery month fees are ever higher which is watertight evidence of ever greater demand to use Bitcoin. That is, people want to send transactions across the blockchain, not just trade on the exchanges.Tx fees time-series data is maintained at Blockchair.comBitcoin and My PortfolioBitcoin holds a dominant place in my cryptoasset portfolio. As a result of recent changes in UK regulations I have allocated my entire personal pension (like a US 401k or retirement account) into Bitcoin via the XBTProvider ETN.Be more cautious about investing your 401k into Barry Silbert\u2019s Bitcoin Investment Trust $GBTC. The (European) XBT Provider ETN is an open-ended fund which means it maintains a premium to the NAV close to 0% at all times. The Bitcoin Investment Trust is an inferior investment vehicle because it is a closed-end fund (it does not increase its holdings of the underlying asset when demand for the product increases) which means it is subject to wild swings in its premium, which has been as high as 150%. So you could make the mistake of buying when the premium is high and suffer swingeing losses even when the Bitcoin price is stable.Rule 2: \u201cWhen you See it, Bet Big.\u201d George Soros.Something extraordinary is happening. The cypto space in June 2017 is like the Internet space in 1995. It is a great opportunity.Stanley Druckenmiller has written about his dealings with George Soros whom he quotes as saying \u2018When you see it, bet big\u2019. The funny thing is, I was mocked by a Hedge Funder on Twitter named Sarah Cone (@impcapital ) when I revealed that I had seen it and I had bet big. I bet big with my entire fucking pension.George Soros: When you see it, bet big.Here is Charlie Munger expressing a similar thought:Rule 3: Index Track the Top 10 CryptoassetsUntil 18 May 2017 I held very little Ethereum and zero Ripple in my portfolio.I made a great mistake in not buying Ethereum and Ripple in 2017 until 18 May. My mistake was Bitcoin Maximilism. I refused to have anything to do with Ethereum and Ripple because I didn\u2019t like them. As a result I missed these returns.Source: CryptoCurrencyChartI came to my senses on 18 May, 2017 when I underwent an epiphany. I then made a new (self-imposed) rule : broadly track the Top 10 cryptoassets in my portfolio, regardless of my opinion about their individual merits.I have applied a flexible, discretionary form of index-tracking since then.I execute index-tracking manually off this Google Sheet:At the time of writing, 20 June 2017, the results of index-tracking have been pleasing.YTD 2017 returns for Cryptocurrencies, 18 May 2017:My portfolio was up 106% YTD.YTD 2017 returns for Cryptocurrencies, 20 June 2017:My portfolio was up 281%. So in one month (18 May to 20 June) it has raced past Bitcoin, $GBTC, and Monero, and has made good ground in catching up with Global Cryptocurrencies.I ruled myself free to apply discretion in my index-tracking. It was very clear early on that Ripple was in a secular bear market against Bitcoin from 18 May and I quickly became and stayed underweight in Ripple.I also went underweight in Ethereum in mid-June at $350 \u2014 $360.Why? Because:Is Ethereum in a bubble?I don\u2019t know. Applying the same metrics used above to $ETH it does pretty well, but not as well as Bitcoin. But there are clear risks and as a result I am underweight in Ethereum compared to its share of the global Cryptoasset Market Cap.Growth (Price & MCap): Ethereum has outstanding growth in its short life, but it was only created in August 2015 so it lacks the 8-year track record of Bitcoin. This is significant. Ethereum\u2019s explosive performance in 2017 could indeed fit into the time-frame of a bubble.Trading Volumes & Volume/MCap Ratio: Great. Similar to Bitcoin.Transaction Fees: All good. They are rising quickly indicating true demand for this cryptoasset.Source: Bitinfocharts.comMetrics aside, Spencer Bogart makes great sense in this thread where he describes the regulatory risk and other risks that might bring the Ethereum house of cards down. It is possible that the SEC will rule that the ICOs are illegal sale of securities. People might go to prison. It is for these reasons that I am under-allocated.Note: If Governments decide to put a stop to the cryptoasset economy, there is a crucial distinction between Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin is truly decentralised. It has honeybadger, even cockroach qualities and is resistant to such measures. Ethereum is a registered commercial legal entity in Switzerland and can be shut down overnight.Rule 4: Scale Out (Take Some Profits)Anyone who has lived through a bubble knows the value of this.I have experienced several bubbles, namely London housing 1984\u20131988, DotCom in 1998\u20132000, London housing again 2002\u20132008, the Bulgarian property market (seaside apartments and ski apartments) 2004\u20132008.It\u2019s human nature to be cautious at first and then progressively relaxed, even reckless. My observations suggest that it is best to behave in the opposite, counter-intuitive way: commit yourself to the market with reckless abandon in the early days, and then start the scaling out process, applying the brakes and get the hell out when it appears to be the later stages.In all those bubbles I made great paper profits that disappeared in a matter of months. The paper profits were more than 2 million Euros in the Bulgarian property market. In none of them did I take profit off the table in the run-up. Christ did I regret that. I am taking profit off the table in the cryptoasset market.Finally, at the end, you must scale out completely. Jesse Livermore\u2019s advice for a bull market:It is not my opinion that we are near the last eighth:Rule 5: The Honeybadger Trade: Buy the Dip.Lots of influential actors \u2014 Governments, banks, regulators \u2014 fear Bitcoin and try to kill it on a regular basis. Bitcoin takes massive hit after massive hit, but it has always rode the punches and bounced back. Experienced traders have noted this and the advice is to buy the dip. This is the Honeybadger Trade.I like the idea of BTFD, as I truly believe in Bitcoin. BTFD! people on Twitter yell. But it has puzzled me for a while.There is a solution. Buy on margin at the dips. The beauty of this is that you do not need to add funds to your account, you merely avail yourself of the leverage already available. Use Bitmex Exchange.I permit myself to use margin in the specific case of BTFD.You need to get the timing of BTFD right. Beetcoin on Twitter provided this great analysis (thread) demonstrating that you should stay out for the first 48 hours of a dip and then BTFD.Do NOT Sell the DipYou need to be clear, is this a dip or is it a secular bear market? I BTFDd relentlessly in the DOTCOM unravelling in 2000 and lost every penny in the end.If it is an established, secular bear market then face the music and STFD.Rule 6: Don\u2019t Overtrade. Lock up CoinsI over-trade stupidly at at tiny whims when I am bored or drunk. A solution I have found is to lock coins away out of reach.One way is to keep Bitcoins and others in your hardware wallet. I use Trezor. It can store Bitcoin, Ethereum (+ all ERC-20 tokens), Ethereum Classic, ZCash, Litecoin, and Dash.Another way is to lock them into terms deposits at Cryptopia (applies only to Dotcoin). This gives you the added benefit of earning interest on coins at interest rates that just do not exist outside crypto (about 18% p.a.).Rule 7: Let Profits Run. Cut Losses.This guy turned $10,000 into $6 million by letting his profits run during the Ethereum run-up in the first half of 2017.Run profits Cut Losses is hard to do exactly. In my P&L Sheet I focus on the 7d (Price Change over 7 days) to decide whether to re-allocate my portfolio according to this rule. I largely ignore 1 h and even 24 h .Rule 8. Treat ICOs and other Examples of Herd Mentality with CareIn general you are better off holding Ethereum than going through the mad, greedy, FOMO process of buying ICOs.But ICOs or coins newly released on the exchanges can be great investments. Beetcoin played the IOTA new release on Bitfinex like a master. He turned 10 Bitcoin into more than 200 Bitcoin. He bought the $IOT Over the Counter (OTC) some time before Bitfinex listed it. He was ahead of the herd.Rule 9 Do Your Own Research. Examine Micro-Caps.I respect this strategy.I bought Elastic $XEL at the obscure Heat exchange. It was rather difficult discovering how to buy it because I was in this case ahead of the herd where the path was not well defined. In the end I bought it at a high price (average 31,367 Satoshis, should have got them at 25,000 Sats) as I got scammed over at Heat by a predator (Arsonic @Ars0nic on Twitter) playing the order book. We\u2019ll see how that plays out. I think the excessive price I paid will not matter too much.Rule 10 Be Careful as Hell with LeveragingObviously leveraging can work, as with the guy referenced above who has made $6 million relentless buy Ethereum on leverage since December 2016.I take out the rare leveraged position at Bitmex Exchange.It can also go horribly wrong when margin calls occur across the mass market.That said, those who lost everything were not the brightest traders. They could have avoided that by using judiciously set Stop-Limit orders, rather than plain Stop orders.So that is the Ten Rules.If you liked this please Clap and Follow me on Twitter: @ BambouClub", "responses": 25, "tags": ["Bitcoin", "Ethereum", "Investing", "Finance", "Cryptocurrency"]}, {"title": "Bitcoin might be the Crypto-Gold.

As such, they transcend the genre of crypto, and reach into the soul of blockchain for a new model humans could use to build a more transparent, decentralized and free society.That\u2019s a dream that\u2019s going to be popular with not just Millennials, but the GenZ and Alpha generations that grow up increasingly with artificial intelligence. If Millennials were mobile natives with an always-on internet, GenZ are video natives and Alpha are AI-natives.A number of progressive states have given us reason to believe their fiat currency will be on the blockchain before 2020, such as Estonia, Japan, Kazakhstan, India, Russia, China and others. While this doesn\u2019t mean they will be decentralized obviously, it means that cryptocurrencies are going mainstream, not just in terms of interest of investors, but by business and governments as well. Ethereum of all the crypto entities has the best chance of evolving into something much more persuassive and all-encompassing.Ethereum\u2019s market cap is on the way up, and as it scales its transaction frequency it can become something altogether unprecedented.If 2008 is known as the Great Recession, what will 2017 be known for? As American presidents become long forgotten footnotes, the blockchain will represent a significant crossroads of the web in its infancy and how it joined with artificial intelligence and a revolutionary kind of transparent system of trust for homo sapiens in the early 21st century.If altcoins are not always trustworthy, and if ICOs even can sometimes be fraudulent, a blockchain platform is trustworthy in a world that doesn\u2019t trust changing governments and rising and falling corporations, all of which amount to short-term interests.Even with many firms becoming blockchain as a service providers, Ethereum remains an attractive option for firms seeking secure transactions. Ethereum\u2019s founder recently spoke about a three to four year long-term plan for Ethereum.When one of the world leaders in blockchain is a 23-year old, there\u2019s a sense that we are in uncharted horizons of what the future might bring. Once the scalability problem is solved, Ethereum has the possibility of becoming one of the key blockchain platforms of the future, or could be overtaken by Chinese equivalent, NEO.We trusted Google because they weren\u2019t Microsoft and we trusted Facebook because it wasn\u2019t Google. Now we only trust in code. \u2014 Joaquim Pedro AntunesBlockchain can solve our collective epidemic of trust, and as wealth inequality keeps pushing young people down, it\u2019s more badly needed than ever to be solved in the challenging next two decades or rapid technological change and automation.If Bitcoin has a somewhat shady reputation among GenX, regulators, police authorities and as a means of covert exchange of funds on the dark web, Ethereum has a totally different aura, possibility and probably, another destiny altogether.Correct me if I am wrong?", "responses": 24, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Ethereum", "Cryptocurrency", "Bitcoin", "Millennials"]}, {"title": "Comparison of Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric and Corda", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@philippsandner/comparison-of-ethereum-hyperledger-fabric-and-corda-21c1bb9442f6?source=search_post", "author_name": "Philipp Sandner", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@philippsandner", "publish_date": "2017-06-25", "last_modified_date": "2018-08-11", "readtime": "9.49", "claps": 4722, "voters": 803, "content": "Comparison of Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric and CordaPhilipp SandnerFollowJun 25, 2017 \u00b7 10 min readAuthors: Martin Valenta, Philipp Sandner.Download the article as PDF file.

Our intention is to give decision makers new to DLT guidance for what use cases Hyperledger Fabric, Corda and Ethereum are most suitable.Three different frameworksFrom the white papers of Hyperledger Fabric, R3 Corda (in the following only referred to as Fabric and Corda, respectively) and Ethereum it becomes obvious that these frameworks have very different visions in mind with respect to possible fields of application. Development of both Fabric[i] and Corda[ii] is driven by concrete use cases, whereas Corda\u2019s use cases are drawn from the financial services industry. Consequently, this is where Corda sees its main field of application. In contrast, Fabric intends to provide a modular and extendable architecture that can be employed in various industries, from banking and healthcare over to supply chains. Ethereum also presents itself as utterly independent of any specific field of application.[iii] However, in contrast to Fabric, it is not modularity that stands out but the provision of a generic platform for all kinds of transactions and applications. Table 1 provides a summary of the three frameworks.Table 1: Comparison of Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric and CordaParticipation of peersWith conventional central data storage, only a single entity, the owner, keeps a copy of the underlying database, e.g. a ledger. Consequently, this entity controls what data is contributed and what other entities are permitted to contribute. With the advent of DLT this radically changes in favor of distributed data storage where multiple entities hold a copy of the underlying database and are naturally permitted to contribute. All entities that participate in distributed data storage form a network of so-called nodes or peers. Due to distributed data storage, the difficulty arises to ensure that all nodes agree upon a common truth, e.g. the correctness of a ledger, as changes made by one node have to be propagated to all other peer nodes in the network. The result of arriving at a common truth is called consensus among nodes and is described below.With respect to participating to consensus, there are two modes of operation: permissionless and permissioned. If participation is permissionless, anybody is allowed to participate in the network. This mode is true for Ethereum as a public blockchain. On the other hand, if participation is permissioned, participants are selected in advance and access to the network is restricted to these only. This is true for Fabric and Corda. The mode of participation, permissionless or permissioned, has a profound impact on how consensus is reached.ConsensusEthereum. With Ethereum, all participants have to reach consensus over the order of all transactions that have taken place, irrespectively of whether a participant has taken part in a particular transaction or not. The order of the transactions is crucial for the consistent state of the ledger. If a definitive order of transactions cannot be established there is a chance that double-spends might have occurred, that is, two parallel transactions transfer the same coin to different recipients, thus making money out of thin air. As the network might involve mutually distrusting and anonymous parties, a consensus mechanism has to be employed that protects the ledger against fraudulent or adverse participants that attempt double-spends. In the current implementation of Ethereum, this mechanism is established by mining based on the proof-of-work (PoW) scheme. All participants have to agree upon a common ledger and all participants have access to all entries ever recorded. The consequences are that PoW unfavorably affects the performance of transactions processing.[v] Concerning the data stored on the ledger, even though records are anonymized, they are nevertheless accessible to all participants, which is problematic for applications that require a higher degree of privacy.In contrast to Ethereum, Fabric\u2019s and Corda\u2019s interpretation of consensus is more refined and does not merely boil down to mining based on PoW or a derivative thereof. Due to operating in a permissioned mode, Fabric and Corda provide a more fine-grained access control to records and thus enhance privacy. Furthermore, a gain in performance is achieved as only parties taking part in a transaction have to reach consensus.Fabric. Fabric\u2019s understanding of consensus is broad and encompasses the whole transaction flow, starting from proposing a transaction to the network to committing it to the ledger.[vi] Furthermore, nodes assume different roles and tasks in the process of reaching consensus. This contrasts to Ethereum where roles and tasks of nodes participating in reaching consensus are identical.Within Fabric, nodes are differentiated based on whether they are clients, peers or orderers.[vii] A client acts on behalf of an end-user and creates and thereby invokes transactions. They communicate with both peers and orderers. Peers maintain the ledger and receive ordered update messages from orderers for committing new transactions to the ledger. Endorsers are a special type of peer, whereas their task is to endorse a transaction by checking whether they fulfill necessary and sufficient conditions (e.g. the provision of required signatures). Orderers provide a communication channel to clients and peers over which messages containing transactions can be broadcasted. With respect to consensus in particular, the channels ensure that all connected peers are delivered exactly the same messages with exactly the same logical order.At this point, the problem arises that there might occur faults in the delivery of messages when many mutually untrusting orderers are employed. As a consequence, a consensus algorithm has to be used in order to reach consensus despite faults, e.g. inconsistent order of messages, thus making the replication of the distributed ledger faults tolerant. With Fabric, the algorithm employed is \u201cpluggable\u201d, meaning that depending on application-specific requirements various algorithms can be used. For example, in order to deal with random or malicious replication faults as outlined above a variant of the Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) algorithms could be used. Furthermore, channels partition message flows, meaning that clients only see the messages and associated transactions of the channels they are connected to and are unaware of other channels. This way, access to transactions is restricted to involved parties only with the consequence that consensus has only to be reached at transaction level and not at ledger level as with Ethereum.The roles of nodes outlined above are now described in the context of the transaction flow: A client sends a transaction to connected endorsers in order to initiate an update of the ledger. All endorsers have to agree upon the proposed transaction, thus some sort of consensus has to be reached regarding the proposed ledger update. The client now successively collects approval of all endorsers. The approved transaction is now sent to connected orderers which again reach consensus. Subsequently, the transaction is forwarded to peers holding the ledger for committing the transaction.Without going further into detail, it becomes clear that Fabric allows fine-grained control over consensus and restricted access to transactions which results in improved performance scalability and privacy.Corda. Similar to Fabric, consensus in Corda is also reached at transaction level by involving parties only. Subject to consensus is transaction validity and transaction uniqueness[viii]. Validity is ensured by running the smart contract code (smart contracts are described in detail below) associated with a transaction, by checking for all required signatures and by assuring that any transactions that are referred to are also valid. Uniqueness concerns the input states of a transaction. Specifically, it has to be ensured that the transaction in question is the unique consumer of all its input states. In other words, there exists no other transaction that consumes any of the same states. The reason for this is to avoid double-spends. Consensus over uniqueness is reached among participants called notary[ix] nodes, whereas the employed algorithm is \u201cpluggable\u201d as with Fabric. So once again a BFT algorithm might be used.Smart contractsThe term \u201csmart contract\u201d causes considerable misunderstanding when first encountered as it evokes the idea of some sort of contract that intelligently acts on one\u2019s behalf. The contract\u2019s nature, however, remains vague, but intuitively appears to be linked to legal matters. That said, focal contracts are neither smart in the sense that they are e.g. driven by artificial intelligence, at least not yet, nor do they generally encode obligations and rights that are legally binding. Clark and colleagues[x] provide a useful terminology by highlighting two different ways the term \u201csmart contracts\u201d is commonly used. The first refers to smart contract code, the second to smart legal contracts, two distinctions that prove to be beneficial in the context of this comparison.Smart contract code simply denotes software written in a programming language. It acts as a software agent or delegate of the party that employed it with the intention that it fulfills certain obligations, exercises rights and may take control of assets within a distributed ledger in an automated way. Thus, it takes on tasks and responsibilities in the distributed ledger world by executing code that models or emulates contract logic in the real world, though its legal justification may be unclear.All DLTs feature smart contracts in the sense of smart contract code that can be written in Go or Java for Fabric[xi], in Solidity[xii] for Ethereum and in Java or Kotlin for Corda[xiii]. In Fabric, the term \u201cchaincode\u201d is used as a synonym for smart contract. As an illustrative example, the reader is reminded of the usage of a smart contract code in the consensus mechanism of Corda in order to ensure transaction validity. However, there is a notable difference between Fabric and Ethereum on the one hand and Corda on the other that is connected to the second way the \u201csmart contracts\u201d term is used.In Corda, smart contracts not only consist of code but additionally are allowed to contain legal prose. Thus above smart legal contracts are legal prose that are formulated in a way that they can be expressed and implemented in smart contract code. The rationale behind this is to give the code legitimacy that is rooted in the associated legal prose. Such a construct is called Ricardian Contract[xiv]. At this point, it again becomes clear that Corda was explicitly designed to account for the highly regulated environment of the financial services industry. Both Fabric and Ethereum lack this feature.Built-in currencyAnother noteworthy difference is that Ethereum features a build-in cryptocurrency called Ether. It is used to pay rewards to nodes that contribute to reach consensus by mining blocks as well as to pay transaction fees. Therefore decentralized apps (DApps) can be built for Ethereum that allow monetary transactions. Furthermore, a digital token for custom use cases can be created by deploying a smart contract that conforms to a pre-defined standard.[xv] This way, own currencies or assets can be defined.Fabric and Corda do not require a build-in cryptocurrency as consensus is not reached via mining. With Fabric, however, it is possible to develop a native currency or a digital token with chaincode.[xvi] With Corda, a creation of digital currencies or tokens is not intended.[xvii]Summary: customized vs. generic platformTo sum up, the examined DLTs span a continuum. On the one side, there is Fabric and Ethereum. They both are highly flexible, but in different aspects. Ethereum\u2019s powerful smart contracts engine makes it a generic platform for literally any kind of application. However, Ethereum\u2019s permissionless mode of operation and its total transparency comes at the cost of performance scalability and privacy. Fabric solves performance scalability and privacy issues by permissioned mode of operation and specifically by using a BFT algorithm and fine-grained access control. Further, the modular architecture allows Fabric to be customized to a multitude of applications. An analogy to a versatile toolbox can be drawn.Corda is located at the other end. It has been consciously designed as DLT for the financial services industry. Most notably, it takes the highly regulated environment into account by augmenting smart contracts with legal prose.Apparently, Corda\u2019s focus solely on financial services transactions simplified its architectural design compared to Fabric. Therefore, it might offer a more out-of-the-box experience. However, it might be possible that Fabric, due to its modularity, can be tailored to resemble Corda\u2019s feature set. Efforts exist that seek to integrate Corda into the Hyperledger project. Corda therefore cannot be seen as a competitor to Fabric but more as a complement.RemarksIf you like this article, we would be happy if you forward it to your colleagues or share it on social networks.Download the article as PDF file.

It is very much still accurate and worth reading, and I encourage that, but be aware that the landscape has changed (it\u2019s been 10 years in crypto-time \ud83d\ude02).You should read this blog post if:You\u2019re a professional software engineerYou want to have a deep working understanding of Ethereum and the related ecosystem.Prerequisites:You understand the concept of a blockchain and how Bitcoin uses it to create a trustless digital currency. No? Watch this short video or watch this long video. Hint, you should probably watch the long one.You\u2019re a professional software engineer. Seriously, I mean, nontrivial amounts of real-world software engineering experience. Understanding systems/architecture/math is a learning efficiency multiplier.Like a week of your free time. I told you we\u2019re skipping the nonsense.You understand the basic concept of a merkle tree and how it can be used to quickly verify information correctness.Note: you don\u2019t need to read the whitepapers, but you need to understand them. But it turns out that reading them is the fastest way to understand them. \ud83d\ude09I recommend reading the entirety of this post, absorbing the contents at a high level, and then diving into each link individually, over the course of a few days.You\u2019ll be surprised at how little of this technology is magic (read: none of it), despite the severe case of buzzword-itis the ecosystem has. Everyone is building off of the shoulders of giants; if you make a living as a professional software engineer you have the ability to understand all of these projects and technologies at a deep level. Just don\u2019t get distracted by the bullshit.EthereumEthereum is a distributed computer; each node in the network executes some bytecode (hint: Smart Contracts), and then stores the resulting state in a blockchain. Due to the properties of the blockchain representing application state, this results in \u201capplications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third party interference\u201d.Obviously an acceptable explanation won\u2019t fit into a paragraph. Go ahead and read the Ethereum whitepaper. Or one of the other trillion \u201chow do I Ethereum/Blockchain/Smart Contract\u201d posts on the internet. Or watch this video titled \u201cEthereum in 25 Minutes\u201d.Smart ContractA \u201cSmart Contract\u201d is literally just some code (seriously, that\u2019s it) that\u2019s executed in a distributed environment like the Ethereum platform. The platform on which it\u2019s executed gives this piece of code some properties such as: immutability, deterministic operation, distributed & verifiable state, etc. The state managed by this code is stored, immutably, on a blockchain and anyone can double check that the current state is correct by replaying all of the transactions from the beginning of the chain.In Ethereum, contracts are given an address to uniquely identify them (it\u2019s a hash of the creator\u2019s address and how many transactions they\u2019ve sent before). Clients can then interface with this address by sending it ether, calling functions, querying the distributed state that it manages, etc.Smart Contracts, again, are just some code with some distributed state managed by a blockchain. For example, multi-sid wallets that you\u2019re using to receive/send ETH is just a smart contract with a fancy UI on it.This concept is pretty powerful, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve already read all about it. If you haven\u2019t, browse your favorite mildly-technical new source (hey Medium!) and you\u2019ll be inundated with people telling you how much potential there is. Some buzzwords: asset/rights management, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), identity, social networking, etc.GasSmart Contracts (again, just blobs of code) are executed by every single full node in the network, which is a lot of redundancy (good) but this costs a lot of energy and time (bad). Because it costs money to perform computations, the cost of performing computations is directly tied to which computations your code performs. To say that another way, each low level opcode in the EVM costs a certain amount of \u201cgas\u201d to perform. The word \u201cgas\u201d is totally arbitrary; it\u2019s just an abstract label given to the cost of performing computation. There\u2019s also a network-enforced gas limit, to solve the halting problem; i.e., you can\u2019t write a program that never ends, because you\u2019d run out of gas and the computation would be rejected by the network.The \u201cprice\u201d of gas (i.e. \u201chow much $$$ does adding two numbers together on this distributed computer cost me\u201d) is determined by the market, similar to Bitcoin\u2019s transaction fees. If you pay a higher gas price, nodes will prioritize your transactions for that sweet sweet profit.In general, it\u2019s way more expensive to compute and store things on Ethereum than it would be to do it in a traditional environment, but Ethereum gives your code all those nice properties we discussed above, which can be just as valuable.In general, reading state is free and writing state costs gas. Here\u2019s a more in-depth overview of the concept of gas:Calculating Costs in Ethereum ContractsWhat are users storing when they hold Ether? In one sense, they are storing the ability to perform computation on the\u2026hackernoon.comDistributed App (dApp)A Distributed App is an app where the \u201cserver side\u201d is just one or more well-known Smart Contracts that exist on the Ethereum network.A Distributed App doesn\u2019t need to store all of its state and perform all of its computation on the blockchain, which would be pretty expensive for end-users, but a distributed app does eventually store trusted state on the Ethereum blockchain, which anyone can then read. Many distributed apps also use technologies like IPFS and Golem (discussed later) to handle computation and storage off of the Ethereum blockchain, but in an equally decentralized manner.The ethereum organization on github has a dapp-bin repository that has some references and examples. Make sure you check the activity on the file you\u2019re looking at, though, cause this kind of information gets stale very quickly.Also, we\u2019ve finally agreed on the proper capitalization of \u201cdApp\u201d via twitter poll (so you know it\u2019s statistically significant), so let\u2019s all just write it as \u201cdApp\u201d then, yeah?dApp ClientThese distributed applications are usually accompanied by some sort of user-friendly frontend because nobody wants to manually send transactions to/from contracts using a cli or manually craft requests with hashes and opcodes oh my.A dApp Client is literally just any \u201cclient\u201d or \u201cfrontend\u201d as you\u2019d normally use the term in programming, except this client interfaces with the Ethereum blockchain (perhaps in addition to other services) somehow. These clients are frequently written in JavaScript because we haven\u2019t yet finished converting everything in the world to NodeJS.More seriously, most dApp clients are written primarily in JavaScript because it can be run in a web browser and everyone\u2019s already got one of those. They\u2019re also frequently written in Go due to a superior state of existing tooling available. It\u2019s a viciously positive cycle of improvement, which means unless you really know what you\u2019re doing, you get to choose between JavaScript and Go (and to a certain extent, Rust) for interfacing with the Ethereum blockchain and the protocols being developed on top of it.* So there\u2019s a little bit of confusion/discussion around the exact terminology/definition of \u201cDistributed App\u201d: is it just the smart contract(s)? Is it the entire backend of a system which, at some point, interfaces with the Ethereum platform to store trust? Or maybe it includes the client code, too, and the user interface so the whole bundle of stuff is called a \u201cdApp\u201d?* I\u2019ve gone ahead and defined as \u201cthe backend of a system that interfaces with the Ethereum blockchain\u201d. This is different enough from \u201cSmart Contract\u201d to warrant its own concept and also implies (correctly) that anyone can create a client to interface with a distributed appdApp BrowsersA dApp Browser is exactly what it says on the tin; it\u2019s an application (a normal one that we\u2019re all familiar with) that makes using dApp clients (usually javascript that interfaces with an Ethereum node to communicate with smart contracts) easier.The primary purposes of a dApp browser are toProvide a connection to an Ethereum node (either to one hosted locally or remotely) and an easy way to change that connection to point to a different node (which might be connected to a different network),And provide an account interface (\u201cwallet\u201d) for the user so that they can easily interface with these dApps.Mist is the official Ethereum dApp browser. It\u2019s really just a pretty web UI for interfacing with an Ethereum node and sending transactions to/from Smart Contracts (dApps!).Status is a mobile browser with a unique approach to the UX of using dApps.Toshi is Coinbase\u2019s foray into building an Ethereum wallet and browser. It bets big on the \u201cwechat\u201d + \u201cchatbot\u201d vibes.MetaMask is a Chrome Extension that turns Chrome into a \u201cdApps Browser\u201d. Its core feature is that it injects web3, a JavaScript Ethereum client library, into every page, allowing dApps to connect to MetaMask\u2019s hosted Ethereum nodes. The Chrome extension allows you to manage wallets and connect to the different Ethereum networks available.Parity is a an Ethereum client (as well as a full-node implementation) that integrates with your web browser, turning it into a dApp browser.Ethereum NodesMostly everything you know about Bitcoin nodes applies here. Nodes store a copy of the blockchain and optionally execute all of the transactions to confirm the resulting state. Run yourself a full node or light client with geth (first-party, Go) or parity (third-party, Rust).Your node needs to know which blockchain to download and which peers to talk to; see below for a discussion of the different networks available.You should probably go ahead and run all of these node clients with docker and some sort of persistent storage. If you don\u2019t feel like running a node on your own, you can use a third party like Infura. There is also a way to run a local node for testing and development, discussed later.If you\u2019re distributing a dApp client to users, you don\u2019t necessarily need to provide access to an Ethereum node as well; dApp Browsers provide the connection to any client that needs it.Ethereum TokensSo you know how we can write code (a \u201cSmart Contract\u201d) that stores some state on a blockchain? What if, in that state, we stored a map of ethereum addresses to an integer. And called that integer your balance. Your balance of what? Let\u2019s just call them \u201ctokens\u201d. Oh.Yeah, all of the \u201ctokens\u201d that you hear about are just numbers in a distributed hash table with an API (aka protocol) to add and subtract. Here\u2019s what a basic token contract looks like (that\u2019s 38 lines of code, half of it comments and whitespace).Go ahead and read the ethereum.org tutorial on creating a crowdsale; you\u2019ll see that it\u2019s just a contract (Crowdsale) that interfaces with another contract (MyToken) which is just like the basic token contract linked above. It\u2019s not magic.People are using tokens for a variety of uses, and you\u2019ll quickly see that imagination has no limits. Tokens are frequently used to incentivize interaction with a protocol, prove ownership of assets, proof of voting rights, etc. Fred Ehrsam from Coinbase has a good talk about tokens, why they exist, and how they\u2019re being used.Vitalik recently wrote a blog post analyzing token sale models, which is a good read.ERC20 / ERC223 / ERC777 / ERC827 / All the TokensEveryone started defining their own protocol for interfacing with their Token contract and that got old pretty quickly, so some some people got together and created the ERC20 spec. It just says \u201chey, support these function signatures and we\u2019ll all have a much better time\u201d.Due to some issues with the ERC20 spec (namely that it was made quickly, has small security concerns, and requires two transactions for payments), now we have more proposed token standards.ERC223ERC777ERC827* there had been some confusion around ERC223 vs ERC23, but they are the same concept; the ERC number is 223, so this standard should be referred to as ERC223.ERC721 / NFT TokensERC721 defines a non-fungible token standard. Non-fungibility means that each token is not equal to another; one \u201ctoken\u201d can be worth more or less than another and have unique properties. The best example of this is something like CryptoPunks or CryptoKitties.* there was also ERC821 but its ideas have been merged via community consensus into ERC721An Artist\u2019s Guide to the Blockchain / Part 1Explore the potentials of this emerging technology, and become an active participant to help shape what\u2019s to come.medium.comInterfacing with Smart ContractsYou interface with your smart contract (aka, executing methods and reading state) by connecting to an Ethereum node and executing functions over a JSON RPC API. There are a variety of Ethereum node clients that perform this in a developer-friendly way. Both geth and parity provide consoles/browsers for interfacing with contracts.If you\u2019d like to programmatically interface with contracts, there are various Ethereum client implementations. For JavaScript, web3.js, ethjs, and ethers.js are popular. For golang, the abigen executable in go-ethereum provides go packages for interfacing with contracts. At the end of the day, though, it\u2019s just a standard JSON RPC API, so you can always write your own adaptor for the language of your choice if once isn\u2019t available. Some client libraries provide convenience functions as well, beyond simple function execution.Run a local ethereum node for testing and development with Ganache (previously called ethereumjs-testrpc).When you \u201cdeploy\u201d a smart contract, all you\u2019re really doing is sending a transaction to the 0-address ( 0x0 ) with the contract bytecode as an argument.Here\u2019s more information about transactions:Inside an Ethereum transactionEthereum can be thought of as a transaction based state machine, where transactions can change the state and the state\u2026medium.comTruffle, Embark, Populous, Perigord & OthersOnce you start writing smart contracts, you end up doing a lot of the same things over and over again; compiling your source code to bytecode and an abi, deploying it to the network, testing the deployed contract, etc. You probably also want a nice way to play around with new ideas.Frameworks like Truffle, Embark, Populous, and Perigord standardize and automate a lot of the minutiae. They provide a nice developer experience for writing contracts, deploying contracts, and incredibly importantly, testing contracts.Truffle (written in Node) has the most developer adoption and seems to have the most active development; follow the Getting Started guide to get up to speed.This post has a lot of good information and uses truffle to deploy and interface with a contract.The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to Smart Contracts in EthereumI\u2019ve been working with smart contracts for 4 years, mainly in the Bitcoin blockchain. Some projects I participated in\u2026blog.zeppelin.solutionsEmbark (Node) has similar but different ideas for how developers should structure projects.Perigord (Go) is very similar to Truffle.Populous (Python) is an actively developed python framework that satisfies the same niche.When you first start playing around with contracts, you should avoid using a framework until you understand the value it provides, much in the same way you shouldn\u2019t start learning how to write HTML with rails new . The easiest thing to do at first is use Remix to play around with the language and ideas.ETHPM & NPMSharing is caring, so ETHPM is a decentralized repository of smart contract packages. Using ETHPM, you can inherit from or link to other well-known contracts and libraries, reducing code duplication and ideally providing a strong foundation of good contracts for future development.Of note, you can also use NPM to provide smart contract code for distribution, which a lot of people do, notably Open Zeppelin.Read the spec for more information and background.State of the NetworksMainnet \u2014 the main Ethereum network, and generally the default in whatever client or browser you\u2019re using.Ropsten \u2014 The primary Ethereum testnet using Proof of Work. This network, because of low computation volume, is easy to DDOS, split, and otherwise mess with. It was recently revived and is usable again after being temporarily abandoned after a spam attack. It consistently has a very low gas limit, for no good reason, so many contracts will fail to deploy on this network.Kovan \u2014 A parity-client only testnet using Proof of Authority which advertises immunity to spam attacks and a consistent 4 second block time.Rinkeby \u2014 A geth-client only testnet using Clique Consensus, which is therefore more resilient to malicious actors, despite the low computation volume. (my personal favorite)You can also run your own private Ethereum network. The go-ethereum team built puppeth to configure a full network, complete with custom bootnodes, genesis block, and consensus rules, which is what powers the Rinkeby network. You can also run your own infrastructure, perhaps using kubernetes or docker-compose. But you probably won\u2019t need to run a private network any time soon.\u201cAccounts\u201d vs \u201cWallet\u201dAn Ethereum account is a private key and address pair. They basically just store Ether, and they don\u2019t cost gas to create (because they exist automatically with every possible address). All transactions on the Ethereum network originate from an account; contracts don\u2019t have the ability to initiate a transaction.A wallet is one of two things: it can be 1) a fancy interface for creating and sending transactions using your account (i.e. MyEtherWallet) or 2) just a smart contract (which, again, is just some code) that sends and receives ether; it\u2019s not a native concept. Here\u2019s the Solidity implementation of a wallet on GitHub that\u2019s used by the Mist browser. They can come in many flavors like multisignature, paper, etc.Now that we\u2019ve correctly defined the two, prepare to see people confusing the two terms everywhere and labelling anything that sends/receives Ether as a Wallet and calling anything and everything an account.EVM and the State of Smart Contract CreationThe code that is your Smart Contract runs on every full node in the network within the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine). It\u2019s your standard virtual machine that executes some bytecode, except the vm is specifically isolated from the network, the filesystem, processes, etc. Nobody wants to write bytecode, so we\u2019ve got some higher level languages that compile down to EVM bytecode.SoliditySolidity is the first-party language for describing smart contracts. It\u2019s the most popular and therefore has the most examples, references, and tutorials. You should probably learn this one unless you know what you\u2019re doing.Play around with Solidity in Remix, a web-based playground for Solidity contracts.Here\u2019s what Solidity looks like:pragma solidity ^0.4.11;contract BasicToken {mapping(address => uint256) balances;function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) returns () {    balances[msg.sender] = balances[msg.sender] - _value;    balances[_to] = balances[_to] + _value;  }function balanceOf(address _owner) constant returns (uint256 balance) {    return balances[_owner];  }}LLLLLL, which stands for Low-Level Lisp-Like Language, is exactly what it sounds like on the tin. While LLL isn\u2019t advertised as the primary language supported by the Ethereum team, it still receives updates and is hosted in the same repo as Solidity.Here\u2019s an example ERC20 contract in LLL.LLL looks something like:(seq  (def 'node-bytes  0x00)  (def 'owner    0x20) ; address  (def 'set-node-owner    0x5b0fc9c3) ; setOwner(bytes32,address)  (def 'get-owner (node)      (sload (+ node owner))).... this is just for illustration purposes, this definitely won't compile.If you\u2019re learning, you probably don\u2019t want to write anything in LLL.SerpentSerpent is a high-level python-esq language that compiles to EVM bytecode. It has been effectively deprecated due to the numerous critical-severity bugs found by Zeppelin. For a similar approach to the language, see Vyper.Serpent Compiler AuditThe Augur team asked us to review and audit the Serpent compiler. We looked at the code and now publish our results.blog.zeppelin.solutionsVyper (previously Viper)Vyper is also python-inspired and developed with a focus on security, simplicity, and no-surprises. It is still in development.BambooBamboo is a language designed to represent a smart contract as a finite state machine; your contract is a function of state and transaction and produces a new state. It is still in development.OthersThere are a bunch of other high-level languages in various states of usability and development and more will undoubtedly be developed. In order to reach wide adoption, though, a language and compiler must be thoroughly vetted and tested, which will take time.Smart Contract Decompilation/DisassemblyDecompile Ethereum smart contract bytecode with prosity or disassemble it with evmdis. This is a constantly evolving area, and new tools are being developed pretty quickly. The Awesome Ethereum Virtual Machine repo will contain more information.pirapira/awesome-ethereum-virtual-machineawesome-ethereum-virtual-machine - Ethereum Virtual Machine Awesome Listgithub.comSmart Contract SecurityOnce a smart contract is deployed to Ethereum, it is immutable and exists forever. If you write a bug, you don\u2019t get to take down the broken version; you can only fix-forward*.Because so many engineers developing for Ethereum and other smart contract platforms are coming from web development, this concept might be new and crazy.There are a variety of different security-related traps your code could fall into, both at a language level and from a high-level logic perspective. When you deploy a production smart contract that handles real money, you need to be 100% confident in the operation of the contract.ConsenSys has a beautiful repository of smart contract best practices that you should understand at a deep level.The Parity Wallet Hack ExplainedA vulnerability was found on the Parity Multisig Wallet, that allowed a hacker to steal over 150,000 ETH.blog.zeppelin.solutionsParity Wallet Hack 2: Electric BoogalooPostmortem: The what, when, and how of the Nov 6th Parity Wallet Hackhackernoon.comBefore you deploy a smart contract that\u2019ll handle real cash money, you should probably open a bug bounty and have it pentested. If you\u2019re handling RealMoney\u2122, you should have your code professionally audited.* there\u2019s a selfdestruct() function that a contract can use to remove itself from the network.WhisperWhisper is a messaging system build into Ethereum. It allows dApps to publish small amounts of information for the purpose of communicating with each other in non-real-time.It uses the protocol shh which is pretty cute. There\u2019s surprisingly little documentation and adopting of this protocol.Although it hasn\u2019t been updated in a while, here\u2019s an example dapp using Whisper to implement a chat client.Whether or not whisper is under active development is up for discussion.Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)This is an organization (like, a group of human beings) where, instead of using legal documents to enforce operation, they use a bunch of smart contracts. Your group of human beings then uses these contracts to do all the normal stuff an organization does, like vote on things and determine what color all the local co-op houses should be painted.A side effect of this is that decision making, governance, and what color the houses should be painted is immutably stored on the blockchain (in the state of those contracts). Cool stuff.Ethereum Classic and the DAO HackYou\u2019ve probably heard about the \u201cDAO hack\u201d and how big of a deal it was. The exploit occurred due to a now highly-recognized re-entrancy bug; a malicious contract could cause a non-infinite, recursive call to the contract, causing it to update internal state incorrectly. In the case of the DAO contract, this meant lots of money being sent to someone that should have only gotten small amounts of money. The community voted as a super majority to hard-fork the network and restore funds to the DAO contributors. This resulted in the birth of Ethereum Classic, where no funds were returned; the code that was written is the law of the land, and cannot be reverted.AragonAragon is also tackling the challenge of designing a company that operates according to smart contract logic, with a focus on creating a company, rather than an organization, that can accept investment, handle accounting, pay employees, distribute equity, and generally do business as we know it today. They\u2019re also building a beautiful dApp client to make using their protocol as easy as possible.Check out the aragon-core contracts for a better understanding of how it operates.SwarmSwarm is a decentralized storage network being developed within the Ethereum ecosystem as a first-party project. Read this wiki where the primary Swarm developer compare/contrasts the two projects, but the gist is that they\u2019re basically the same except they have slightly different philosophies and use different protocols under the hood.ProjectsIPFS & FileCoinIPFS (InterPlanetary File System) is a protocol (among other things) for distributing files. Think of it as a filesystem using the ideas behind bittorrent and git where data is content-addressable and immutable. IPFS stores information using a data model called IPLD, which you can learn about via the links below.While this is a new protocol, there is an http gateway and a filesystem adaptor, meaning you can fetch IPFS content via http and mount the entire world wide filesystem on your local disk at /ipfs . IPFS also provides a naming system called IPNS (InterPlanetary Name Space), which allows for mutable state (recall that everything in IPFS is immutable). You can even use DNS TXT records to direct your IPNS client, allowing you to generate human-friendly links to data.FileCoin is Protocol Labs\u2019 effort to create a distributed market for storage on IPFS; aka, an incentive layer for providing storage to the network. The FileCoin consensus protocol (mostly) does away with wasteful Proof of Work and uses Proof of Replication and Proof of SpaceTime (yes, really) to ensure that a piece of data is replicated a certain number of times and is stored for a specific amount of time.You should read the IPFS whitepaper, the FileCoin whitepaper, and the IPLD spec.While FileCoin isn\u2019t yet released, you can use the existing IPFS storage network to host the html/css/js of your dApp client as well as use it as a database using something like orbit-db.There\u2019s also some public backlash about how FileCoin is being implemented and distributed:The analysis Filecoin doesn\u2019t want you to readDigging into the dynamics of Filecoin\u2019s token sale and economymedium.comAugurAugur is a decentralized prediction market (well, two markets) that lets users wager on real-world event outcomes. On one side, you have the prediction market where users trade tokens to indicate belief in a specific outcome; once the outcome is realized, the winning tokens have full value. To facilitate this, you have the decentralized oracle protocol, which creates a market for providing knowledge of real-world events, incentivized by the REP (Reputation) protocol token.The contracts on GitHub for the Augur markets are a great read.Augur Master PlanAugur\u2019s purpose is to democratize and decentralize finance. We\u2019ll do this by enabling anyone, anywhere, at anytime in\u2026medium.comGnosisGnosis is also a decentralized prediction market with a lot of the same ideas and concepts as Augur.

Developers can build an exchange (technically a \u201crelayer\u201d) on top of their distributed application (aka smart contract collection) and users don\u2019t have to worry about trusting your app to settle trades; settlement is handled on the blockchain. The 0x protocol is designed to use off-chain third-parties (those \u201crelayers\u201d) to broadcast trades and manage order books (so orders can be created/updated/deleted without sending a slow & costly transaction to Ethereum) but use Ethereum for settlement.They\u2019ve started by implementing 0x Portal (previously 0x OTC), a dApp that uses their protocol to transfer tokens directly between users. You can check out their contracts on GitHub. They launched the contracts to the mainnet and are working with the community to build out Relayers.Skip the buzzwords and read the 0xProject FAQ.SwapConsenSys is working on Swap, which is very similar, but focused on communicating intents (rather than signed promises to trade) over \u201cindexers\u201d and then having the order be brokered p2p. Here\u2019s a whitepaper.Introducing Swap: A Protocol for Decentralized Peer-to-Peer Trading on the Ethereum BlockchainAt Swap, we\u2019ve been thinking about the best ways to grow the Ethereum token trading ecosystem. Today we are pleased to\u2026media.consensys.netBancorLiquidity of tokens is a relatively large problem in the crypto ecosystem. Trading between users requires satisfying both your desire to buy and the other party\u2019s desire to sell (or vise versa).Bancor is a protocol (and a set of smart contracts implementing that protocol) that lets you create a token that 1) prices itself based on orders and 2) provides instant liquidity by holding another token (like Ether or any ERC20) in reserve as collateral.Hey look here\u2019s a whitepaper that explains it very well.Stablecoins, MakerDAO, & DaiThe value of your arbitrary token managed by the Ethereum blockchain can fluctuate pretty arbitrarily; this sucks if you\u2019re trying to use that token for some sort of actual real-world process (like going to sleep and hoping it\u2019s still worth something). Stablecoins are considered a Big Deal\u2122 for the field of cryptoeconomics.The Maker DAO is a DAO that is managing the Dai stablecoin. Dai was recently released and is currently stable; managing to keep its value during two notably turbulent periods. There are various other Stablecoins being attempted, namely Tether, Fragments, Basecoin.Oraclize\u201cWhat if my Smart Contract needs an external piece of information, like the weather in New York? I\u2019d have to use a decentralized oracle protocol to ask a bunch of people the weather (expensive, slow), but if I wrote a service that provides this information from a central place, I\u2019d be betraying the core idea of a decentralized application.\u201dOraclize attempts to solve this issue by 1) delivering the data to your smart contract from an external source and 2) providing a proof that the information is from that source and unchanged. So if you trust random.org, you can use Oraclize to provide your smart contract with a random number.Their integration is pretty powerful; you can fetch URLs, parse JSON and XPATHs, query WolframAlpha, etc.BTCRelayBTCRelay functions as an oracle for transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain, meaning you can write smart contracts on Ethereum that respond to events on the Bitcoin blockchain. For example, you can let people pay for your service in BTC and a smart contract can verify that the payment has gone through and then perform your service.Open Zeppelin & zeppelin_osZeppelin is a technology firm doing some really awesome, professional stuff in the space. Honestly, they\u2019re doing a lot of things and it\u2019s tough to keep track of it all.They manage Open Zeppelin, a set of vetted smart contract best practices that you can inherit from and use in your own dApps. Check out their GitHub repo of solidity contracts for a great learning resource. Honestly you should probably just read every contract in there.They\u2019re taking that code reusability concept a step forward and creating zeppelin_os. Ignore the term \u201cOS\u201d; it\u2019s not an operating system in a classic sense. zeppelin_os is a collection of features, tools, and services that aim to provide a solid developer experience while maximizing smart contract security.One part of the zeppelin_os is the \u201czeppelin_os Kernel\u201d which is not a kernel, but is actually a set of well-known smart contracts that act as libraries. They\u2019re upgradeable via the proxy library model and can be independently upgraded in case of security patches. Because you\u2019re including less code in the contract itself, deployment costs less gas and developers cut down on code repetition.There are some other neat planned aspects of zeppelin_os, like the scheduler (async execution of contract functions, since by default contracts don\u2019t do anything until interacted with), a marketplace protocol, and off-chain developer experience tools. You can learn more about them via the whitepaper.Introducing zeppelinOS Whitepaper\u2019s First DraftLast month we announced zeppelinOS, the operating system for smart contract applications, and provided a technical\u2026blog.zeppelin.solutions* sidenote: I\u2019m really not a fan of people adopting these already well-defined terms (like OS and Kernel) and using them to describe things that aren\u2019t what we already understand to be an OS and a Kernel. It just adds more confusion to an already ridiculously definition-saturated space. Call your project what it is and don\u2019t fall into the AWS naming trap that requires blog posts like this to accurately describe what you\u2019re working on.ENS - Ethereum Name ServiceENS is a decentralized registry of human-readable names to addresses. Plus one for a descriptive project name. Various projects integrate with it, allowing you to pay .eth addresses or otherwise use it as a convenient lookup tool. You can also create DNS records that resolve to your .eth address.The Brave Browser & The Basic Attention TokenThe BAT is an attempt to decentralize digital advertising by monitoring \u201cuser attention\u201d and distributing value between publishers, advertisers, and users, cutting out the middlemen.Brave and the Basic Attention Token was started by Brendan Eich, who originally created JavaScript and then co-founded Mozilla.uPort & CivicuPort and Civic are tackling the problem of a decentralized identity system.district0xdistrict0x is a higher level approach to decentralized markets and communities. At its core, it\u2019s a bunch of smart contracts governing how people post listings, search and filter listings, manage reputation within the community, manage payments, etc. It can be used to build markets like Ethlance and NameBazaar.People and PlayersConsenSysConsenSys (like, the word consensus, but as a company name; it\u2019s pretty clever but I was pronouncing it as \u201ccon-SEn-SIS\u201d for the longest time so don\u2019t make that mistake) is a \u201cventure production studio\u201d.

Perhaps you want to understand how they work, maybe you want to build your own Dapp, maybe you want to launch the very first billion dollar ICO (sarcasm)... Regardless of your intentions, learning how smart contracts work is invaluable. The Ethereum platform possesses enormous potential to create Dapps that could change the way we interact on the web in the decades to come. While Ethereum deploys smart contracts that work much like a standard blockchain transaction, they yield a conditional statement that must be met before a function(s) is executed. Smart contracts can be used for voting, crowdfunding, blind auctions, multi-signature wallets and MUCH more.Don\u2019t Forget to Check out Part 1 of my Smart Contract Attacks Series!A Quick Smart Contract Example:Bob has his own scrap metal depot business in the United States, Eric is his iron scrap supplier. Eric is based out of China. Bob and Eric have a GREAT business relationship. They trust each other and have been doing business for a long time. Both have booming businesses, and Bob in particular sells out of iron scrap on a routine basis. Bob deploys a contract where once his iron scrap inventory reaches a certain range, he automatically sends an order out to Eric for X lbs of iron scrap at Y ether per ton. Eric agrees to the arrangement and accepts Bob\u2019s payment in ether right away. Eric gets to work right away and starts fulfilling Bob\u2019s order. Eric can exchange his ether at a local exchange online for Yuan for a tiny fee and it\u2019ll be processed instantaneously. Whether Eric decides to hold ether or convert to Yuan is his choice, but either way he can now put this capital to work right away!Both parties are ecstatic! Typically Bob has to contact his bank and request a money wire to be sent to Eric\u2019s bank in China. It typically takes ~48 hours to process the wire transfer, at which point Eric will have to wait another few days for his bank to clear the payment. Not only that, Bob\u2019s bank is going to charge him a fee for wiring money to Eric\u2026 Time and money out the window. To make matters worse, both parties have to deal with the headache of foreign exchange, turning the US Dollars into Chinese Yuan.So What Am I Going to Learn?As the saying goes, \u201cyou have to crawl before you can walk\u201d. Before we get to deploying our first contract it\u2019s important we learn a few basics. More importantly, I\u2019d like to point out that Ethereum\u2019s platform launched in 2016. While still in it\u2019s infancy, now is the perfect time to start learning about smart contracts.In this tutorial we\u2019re going to learn about:Ethereum NodesBuilding A Private Blockchain NetworkMetaMask Browser Plug InMist BrowserEthereum WalletWeb3 Ethereum JavaScript APIRemix Web Browser IDEGeth (Go Ethereum) Command Line InterfaceSolidity Programming LanguageImportant: If at any point you run into an issue with running a program, try launching it as administrator by right clicking on it and selecting \u201cRun as administrator\u201d.Setting Up An Ethereum NodeIn the simplest form, an Ethereum node is any device that is running the Ethereum protocol (blockchain). While nodes are typically running on desktops & laptops, development for mobile is on going. When we connect to the Ethereum protocol we are on the Ethereum blockchain network and are running a node. By running an Ethereum node we can connect to other nodes in the network, have direct access to the blockchain, and even do things like mine blocks, send transactions, and deploy smart contracts.Nodes are written in Go (Go Ethereum/Geth), C++, and Python. In this tutorial we\u2019re going to stick to the most popular of the three, Go. Important to also note that by downloading Geth we are downloading the ENTIRE Ethereum blockchain. That said, make sure you have ~35GBs of storage on your hard drive before continuing.Visit the Go Ethereum website and install GethVisit here: https://geth.ethereum.org/downloads/2. Download the latest release of Geth (currently 1.8.7) for Windows, make sure you download the 64-bit version.Geth Ethereum Downloadable Releases3. Once your download is complete, open the installer and click \u201cI Agree\u201d4. Make sure the Geth box is checked and click \u201cNext\u201d5. You\u2019ll be prompted to select a destination folder for your download. By default, Geth will install under C:\\Program Files\\Geth6. Close installation once complete7. Open up command prompt (I\u2019ll be using Git Bash \u2014 download here: https://git-scm.com/ , do make sure you add to PATH variables during installation) and navigate to the Geth directory by typing \u201ccd C:\\Program Files\\Geth\u201dGeth Path File8. Begin syncing to the Ethereum blockchain by typing \u201cGeth\u201d. Because this is your first sync you\u2019ll download the ENTIRE blockchain from other peers. This will take some time so get comfy\u2026What you\u2019ll see when launching Geth for the first time (post download)Done? Right on! You\u2019re now running an Ethereum Node. Let the fun begin\u2026Establishing Our Own Private Ethereum NetworkNow that we have access to the Ethereum protocol via our node, we\u2019re going to setup our own private server to develop & deploy our smart contract. Note that none of this will actually be deployed on the Ethereum blockchain, instead we\u2019ll deploy on our own blockchain. We\u2019ll start by initializing the very first block in our blockchain, the genesis block (genesis.json).Create a new folder on your desktop called \u201cPrivate Chain\u201d.Open command prompt in this folder and create a data directory folder for our chaindata by typing \u201cMkdir chaindata\u201d. You can open a command prompt in this folder by holding shift and right clicking, then select \u201copen command window here\u201d.Next, we need to create and save our genesis.json block in our Private Chain folder, as the genesis block will be used to initialize our private network and store data in the data directory folder \u201cchaindata\u201d.Open up notepad, copy & paste the code below into a new file called \u201cgenesis.json\u201d and save this file in our Private Chain folder.Learn more about genesis.json parameters visit the link below: https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/2376/what-does-each-genesis-json-parameter-mean{  \"coinbase\"   : \"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001\",  \"difficulty\" : \"0x20000\",  \"extraData\"  : \"\",  \"gasLimit\"   : \"0x2fefd8\",  \"nonce\"      : \"0x0000000000000042\",  \"mixhash\"    : \"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\",  \"parentHash\" : \"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\",  \"timestamp\"  : \"0x00\",  \"alloc\": {},  \"config\": {        \"chainId\": 15,        \"homesteadBlock\": 0,        \"eip155Block\": 0,        \"eip158Block\": 0    }}5. Now we want to initialize our private network in the chaindata directory by using our genesis.json file. We\u2019re going to tell Geth we want the data directory in the \u201cchaindata\u201d directory and where the genesis.json file can be found (make sure genesis.json is NOT in chaindata folder). Type the following command into the cmd line pointing to the Private Chain folder.geth --datadir=./chaindata/ init ./genesis.json6. You should then see that the genesis state was successfully written.7. Now we can start Geth and connect to our own private chain. As you will see the geth.ipc endpoint socket connection will be opened and so will port 30303.geth --datadir=./chaindata/Whenever we start Geth the IPC endpoint will open, which is used to process connections to Geth with programs like MetaMask, Ethereum Wallet, Mist, or for opening the Geth Javascript API console. We will discuss all of these next.Alright, alright, alright! We now have established our very own private geth network!What Is MetaMask Exactly?MetaMask is both an Ethereum browser and a wallet. Through MetaMask you can interact with Dapps and smart contracts on the web without having to download the blockchain or install any software. You simply add MetaMask to chrome as an extensions, create a wallet, and deposit ether. While currently only available for Chrome, expect to see a launch for Firefox in the near future.The biggest downfall to Metamask is that like any online wallet, you must trust MetaMask. The possibility of MetaMask being hacked or leaking your private key does exists, for your information is stored online.You can download MetaMask here: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?hl=enThe Mist BrowserMist is an electron application, meaning that its a desktop hybrid app with a web interface as well. This allows for faster development and changes of the Mist interface and helps with the browser part of Mist. Its important that you recognize Mist is in beta, so expect to run into a few issues here and there.Mist is powerful in that it includes a Geth node that runs in the background upon launch; a connection to the Ethereum blockchain is made right away. But because we want to practice developing a smart contract, we are going to run a node on our private network and will not need Mist to connect to the default Geth node.Read more about Mist: https://github.com/ethereum/mist/wikiWhat About The Ethereum Wallet?The Ethereum Wallet is just a Mist implementation that can only access a single Dapp \u2014 the wallet dapp, this is due to missing features in Mist. The Ethereum Wallet is written in pure HTML and Javascript code, makes use of web3.js to manage your accounts, and runs inside of the Mist browser. You can also download a standalone version if prefered. The wallet is not yet official released, bugs will exist.Ethereum Wallet: https://github.com/ethereum/meteor-dapp-walletLet\u2019s Download the Mist Browser & Connect To Our Private NetworkLet\u2019s take a second to download the Mist browser so we can connect with our private network.Navigate to the Mist download page and download the latest version of the Mist installer \u2014 https://github.com/ethereum/mist/releases2. Open the installer and click \u201cI Agree\u201d3. Confirm the download path C:\\Program Files\\Mist (default) by clicking \u201cNext\u201d4. Confirm the blockchain data to be stored at the default path under ..\\Roaming\\Ethereum and click \u201cInstall\u201dFeel free to open Mist and mess around with the UI to get a better feel for things, but we\u2019ll be opening up Mist shortly.Connecting Mist To Our Private NetworkNow that we knocked out initializing our private network with the genesis block, we can open a command line in our Private Chain folder and tell Geth to connect to our datadir. Type the following command into command prompt:geth --datadir=./chaindata/Geth will now start running and once we open Mist the geth.ipc endpoint will open; Mist will then make the connection to our private network. Make sure Mist is connected by confirming \u201cPrivate-Net\u201d exists in the upper right corner of the Mist launch window.Ignore \u201cLooking for peers\u201d, remember we\u2019re on our own network so you\u2019ll never connect to any other peers.The Basics Of MistLet\u2019s open up Mist and familiarize ourselves with a few things:At the top we can see our tool bar. Navigating to \u201cEthereum Node\u201d under the \u201cDevelop\u201d tab will show that we are NOT connect to Geth, as it is grayed out \u2014 we\u2019re running our own network. Much like Chrome, under the \u201cDevelop\u201d tab we can also access \u201cDeveloper Tools\u201d2. On the left side of the Mist browser we can see the various different tabs that are open, just like any other browser. By clicking on the green box we are opening the Ethereum Wallet. The wallet is a distributed application that makes it incredibly easy to interact with the JavaScript interface of Go Ethereum3. As you can see we\u2019re connected to the Ethereum wallet through https://wallet.ethereum.org/ , don\u2019t forget that Mist is simply a browser. From here we can do things like see past transactions, send ether, and even deploy or watch contracts.4. Under the \u201cWallets\u201d tab we can see our accounts, add new accounts, create wallet contracts (like single owner accounts, multi-signature wallet contracts, and even import wallets), and also examine past transactions5. Let\u2019s create an account by clicking \u201cAdd Account\u201d (synonymous with \u201cwallet\u201d), then \u201cCreate new account\u201d, and enter a super safe password (even though this is an account on our private network and will not be connected to the actual Ethereum network, it\u2019s a good habit). Click \u201cOK\u201d and create your walletUnder the \u201cSend\u201d tab we can send ether from one wallet to another, or even from a wallet to a contract. As you can see below, before hitting send we\u2019re given the option to set the gas (fee) for our transaction. All transactions require some amount of gas to incentivize processing. Depending on how fast we want to get the transaction processed and approved by the blockchain, we can adjust the amount of gas.Lastly, under the \u201cContracts\u201d tab we can deploy new contracts, watch existing contracts, and watch previously created tokens. Here is where we will create and deploy our \u201cHello World!\u201d contract.We can also see the option to watch contracts & tokens. If we have interest in interacting with a previous deployed contract, we can click on \u201cWatch Contracts\u201d and enter in the name of the contract, contract address, and the contract ABI (application binary interface). If we have interest in watching or spending ERC-20 tokens (tokens developed on the Ethereum blockchain), we can also input the token contract address, token name, and token symbol.Now for one of the more exciting parts\u2026 If we move over to the explorer tab (blue box w/ magnifying glass) we\u2018ll see that a browser with an address bar opens up at the top and a web page loads. If we click \u201cconnect\u201d in the upper right hand corner of the screen, we can connect the browser to our wallet. We\u2019 will have then connected to \u201cWeb 3.0\u201d and from here we can visit Ethereum powered distributed applications (Dapps) and use our wallet to interact with them. Try it out for yourself and visit https://www.stateofthedapps.com/ to see a few examples. Pretty cool, huh? As I mentioned before, this is all still relatively new so try and use your imagination for where this all could go\u2026just don\u2019t get lost in space\u2026you gotta come back and finish the rest of this tutorial\u2026Because we\u2019re on our private network, we will be able to connect our wallet to the browser but we do not have any real ether. Thus, we\u2019ll be limited to what we can do when interacting with these Dapps. In order to get the full experience you\u2019ll need to connect to the Ethereum network and deposit ether into your wallet, but that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t browse.Web3.js?! What the???You might be asking yourself \u201chow is Mist able to connect a wallet to a browser and interact with the Ethereum blockchain?\u201d Mist is merely a browser, a browser injected with Web3.js library and can communicate with an Ethereum node or transact with a smart contract deployed on the blockchain. The Web3.js library communicates with an Ethereum node through JSON RPC calls by connecting to an HTTP or IPC connection.If you would like to learn more about Web3.js, feel free to visit the GitHub documentation here at: https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JavaScript-APILet\u2019s Take A Breather For A Second\u2026Okay, so I\u2019ve thrown a lot at you so far. While a lot of it may not have stuck on the first go, I urge you to keep going. Next we\u2019ll be interacting with the Remix web IDE, write our first smart contract in solidity, deploy through Mist, and even interact with it.If something wasn\u2019t explained clearly or maybe I missed something, feel free to drop a comment down below! I\u2019m always happy to clear up any confusion and answer questions you may have. As always, Google is always a safe source for more information.Remix Web Browser IDELet\u2019s jump right into things and start writing our some code! While we can write directly into Mist, we\u2019re going to first write our Solidity code in the Remix web browser IDE. Why? Well, Remix has a handful of features that makes for a more comprehensive development experience (for now). It is typically best used for smaller sized contracts. Remix features include:Integrated debugger (step by step, instructions, monitoring variables, call data, call stack)Warnings such as unsafe code, gas cost, whether functions could be constant, and checks for overlapping variable namesIntegrated testing & deployment environmentStatic analysisSyntax & error highlightingWorks with injected Web3 objectsCan deploy directly to MetaMask or MistLets make our way over to Remix by visiting: https://remix.ethereum.org/Smack dab right in the middle of the page we can see our space for our code. In the upper left of the screen we can see a few different file options available: \u201cCreate New File\u201d, \u201cAdd Local File\u201d, \u201cPublish All Open Files to an Anonymous Github Gist\u201d, \u201cCopy All Files to Another Instance\u201d, and lastly \u201cConnect to Localhost\u201d. We can also see a list of current contracts under development.On the upper right side of our screen we have several tabs to select from. Our \u201cCompile\u201d tab allows for us to compile our contract once complete (set to Auto compile by default). If we click on \u201cdetails\u201d we get a list of several contract details ranging from metadata, to bytecode, to ABI, and even our contract\u2019s Web3 deployment code.The \u201cSettings\u201d, \u201cDebugger\u201d, \u201cAnalysis\u201d, and \u201cSupport\u201d tabs all have their use case and are worth familiarizing yourself with. In the interest of time we\u2019re going to be using the \u201cRun\u201d tab for the rest of this tutorial. If we click on the \u201cRun\u201d tab we can see a few different contract settings.Environment: There are 3 type of environments Remix can be plugged to. Both the Web3 Provider and Injected Web3 environments require external tools like MetaMask or Mist. JavaScript VM is what we\u2019ll stick to, as it will allow for execution to take place in our browser, in addition to our deployment in Mist.Account: Remix provides 5 different accounts with 100 Ether preloaded! These can be used during contract development if desired.Gas limit: Set a limit forthe amount of gas (fee) attached to the contract.Gas Price: Set a required amount of gas for the contract.Value: Deploy the contract with X amount of ether attached.Finally\u2026Hands On Solidity!For those of you familiar with Javascript I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll take notice to the overlaps with Solidity. Much like JS, Solidity is a contract-oriented, high-level language that is designed to target the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The code is statically typed, supports inheritance, libraries and complex user-defined types among other features.In our \u201cHello World!\u201d contract we\u2019re going to create a state variable called counter and assign it a starting value of 5. Then we\u2019re going to create a function that increases our state variable by 1, a function that decreases the variable by 1, a function that returns our counter , and lastly a function that will destroy the contract.The first bit of code that we\u2019ll type into Remix is the source code version. At the time of writing this Solidity 0.4.16 is the latest version that is recognized by Mist. We\u2019re going to call this version by typing at the top of our contract:pragma solidity ^0.4.16;The keyword pragma is called that way because generally pragmas are instructions for the compiler about how to treat the source code.More info on Solidity can be found here in the docs: https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/index.htmlFunctions & StatesLooking at the bare bones of a smart contract we can see that contracts are merely collections of code (its functions) and data (its states) that correspond to a specific contract address on the blockchain.For example, the line uint256 counter; sets the variable counter of type uint256 (unsigned integer of 256 bits). It can now be thought of as a single slot in a database that can be pulled by calling the function of the code that manages the database. We can even set a value for the variable counter while also setting the type as uint256.uint256 counter = 5;State variables are typically outside of functions, making them global variables, and usually are the first few lines in our contract. We\u2019ve now managed to set our variable counter as an uint256 and a value of 5. If we want to call a function to increase the value of counter by 1, we\u2019re going to create a function (we\u2019ll call it \u201cadd\u201d) and tell it to add 1 to counter .function add() public {  counter++;}After calling the function \u201cadd()\u201d, counter will have a value of 6.Building Out The ContractLets create our \u201cHello World!\u201d contract by first creating a contract called such:pragma solidity ^0.4.16;contract HelloWorld { }We can now include that counter state variable that we talked about early. Remember, we\u2019re going to assigning this state variable as an unsigned integer of 256 bits (unsigned meaning that this type can only be positive integers, not positive and negative. 256 bits in size is a design of the Ethereum Virtual Machine). Oh yeah, also set it to a value of 5.pragma solidity ^0.4.16;contract HelloWorld {    uint256 counter = 5;  }Go ahead and see if you can create 2 functions below this state variable assignment. We need 1). a function that increases counter by 1 and 2). a function that decreases the counter by 1.pragma solidity ^0.4.16;contract HelloWorld {  uint256 counter = 5; //state variable we assigned earlier function add() public {  //increases counter by 1  counter++; }  function subtract() public { //decreases counter by 1  counter--; }  }You\u2019ll see from the code above that we assigned both functions the modifier public . Since Solidity knows two kinds of function calls (internal ones that do not create an actual EVM call \u2014 also called a \u201cmessage call\u201d \u2014 and external ones that do), there are four types of visibilities for functions and state variables. Functions can be specified as being external, public, internal or private, the default is public . Aside from the fact that Remix will throw a warning message stating that no visibility is specified and it\u2019s defaulting to public , typing out the function visibility is a good habit to get into. It will allow us to better understand the contract settings when evaluating our code.We\u2019re getting close, but not quite there. Our state variable can change depending on the function we call, but we need a function that will output the value of counter . Try creating a function called \u201cgetCounter()\u201d that will return counter. This will be a read only action, so we need to tell our function that we\u2019ll be returning a constant. Additionally, when returning a state variable we must tell our function the type that is being returned, in this case we\u2019re returning an uint256 as discussed earlier.pragma solidity ^0.4.16;contract HelloWorld {  uint256 counter = 5; //state variable we assigned earlierfunction add() public {  //increases counter by 1  counter++; }  function subtract() public { //decreases counter by 1  counter--; } function getCounter() public constant returns (uint256) {  return counter;    } }While calling a functions on the Ethereum network will require a small amount of gas to be spent, no gas is required when returning a constant function.Awesome! So now we have a contract that allows us to change the value of our global variable counter . We can also increase it by 1, decrease it by 1, and return the value of our counter whenever we want. Let\u2019s give it a whirl\u2026Let\u2019s Test This ThangSo your code should be in Remix and \u201cAuto compile\u201d should be checked by default under the \u201cCompile\u201d tab. Make your way over to the \u201cRun\u201d tab. Default settings will have the environment set to JavaScript VM, an account will be selected, gas limit will be 3000000, and your gas price & value will be 0. Click on \u201cCreate\u201d under your \u201cRun\u201d tab. You should now see your contract created just like below.Notice the amount of ether on our account ticked down slightly from 100 after creating the contract.Right off the bat you can see the 3 functions that we had created \u2014 \u201cadd\u201d, \u201csubstract\u201d, and \u201cgetCounter\u201d. You can also see that our state variable has a value assigned to it of 5. Now, click \u201cadd\u201d to increase our counter by 1. Then go ahead and click \u201cgetCounter\u201d to call our newly modified counter . You should see the value has been updated to 6. Try it again for \u201csubtract\u201d.WOOHOO! Give yourself a pat on the back. You just done did it. Contract created!Deploying Contracts in MistNow that we\u2019ve tested and confirmed our code in Remix, let\u2019s start up Mist (make sure it\u2019s connected to the Private Network) and deploy it on our private network. Navigate to the \u201cContracts\u201d tab of the Ethereum Wallet in Mist. Then select \u201cDeploy New Contract\u201d and paste our code from Remix into the source code box.Before we can proceed any further, we need to have ether in our wallet. We can mine for ether on our private network by running the miner. We\u2019ll do this through the Geth JavaScript console.Open up ANOTHER command prompt window pointing to your private network folder (C:/users/name/desktop/private network) and type geth attach . Hit enter. You will see a Geth JavaScript console generated and you can now enter commands into Geth directly. Let\u2019s begin mining for some ether by typing miner.start(); . You will see that the console returns \u201cnull\u201d and mining has begun! Take a look at your wallet on Mist, you\u2019ll see increments of 5 ether continuously added to your wallet. You can stop the miner anytime by typing miner.stop(); in console\u2026or you can continue to mine fake ether\u2026whatever makes you happy!Learn more about JS console commands here: https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/JavaScript-ConsoleNow move back to the \u201cContracts\u201d tab, \u201cDeploy New Contract\u201d, make sure our code is in the source code box. To the right of the source code box select \u201cHello World\u201d as the contract to deploy, then click deploy.After you have entered your password, make your way back over to the wallets tab. Scroll down to \u201cLastest Transactions\u201d and you will see the contract we just deployed. You\u2019ll also notice that the contract shows 0 of 12 confirmations and is stuck in a perpetual state of \u201ccreating contract\u201d.The reason our contract hasn\u2019t been fully created is that there are no miners on our network confirming our newly deployed contract. Start mining again in the Geth JavaScript console we opened earlier ( miner.start(); ). Once we start mining again we will see that the number of confirmations will start to tick up, eventually fully deploying our contract.Now click on the contract name. From here we can do all sorts of things. We can transfer ether to the contract, copy the contract address, generate a QR code to be scanned, get the contracts interface (ABI), and even execute contract functions.As you can see our \u201cHello World\u201d contract is displaying our getCounter() function with the counter state variable of 5. Make your way over to \u201cselect function\u201d and select either \u201cadd\u201d or \u201csubtract\u201d function. Once selected, hit \u201cexecute\u201d. Do not forget, we\u2019re the only ones on our private network so we need to confirm the transaction by running our miner!And there we have it! Our contract has executed the subtract function and returned a value of \u201c4\u201d. We now have a live smart contract on our private Ethereum blockchain network that can be interacted with on Mist!Bonus: Adding a Self-Destruct FunctionAs mentioned above, when contracts are deployed they are officially added to the Ethereum blockchain and anyone with the contract address can interact with the contract, to a certain degree that is. What if we as the owner decide we want to remove the contract from the blockchain? Fortunately, Solidity offers an incredibly easy, maybe perhaps too easy, method for putting an end to the contract. We can perform the selfdestruct operation. When we selfdestruct the contract, all remaining Ether stored at the contract address is sent to a designated target and the contract is no more.While we want to have the optionality for destroying the contract, we want to make sure that such operation can only be performed by the creator of the contract. It could be CATASTROPHIC to neglect assigning selfdestruct privileges to a certain person(s). We need to first tell our contract who the owner of the contract is, which is the msg.sender . Go ahead and set the state variable owner as msg.sender . Because the msg.sender is associated with an address, we also need to tell Solidity that the state variable is going to be assigned as an address.pragma solidity ^0.4.16;contract HelloWorld {  uint256 counter = 5; //state variable we assigned earlier address owner = msg.sender; //set owner as msg.sender ........}We\u2019re going to call the self-destruct function \u201ckill\u201d and are also going to create a conditional if statement to ensure that the person executing the kill function is infact the owner. We will also set selfdestruct(owner); to tell the contract to send all contract funds back to the owner of the contract.pragma solidity ^0.4.16;contract HelloWorld {  uint256 counter = 5; //state variable we assigned earlier address owner = msg.sender; //set owner as msg.senderfunction add() public {  //increases counter by 1  counter++; }  function subtract() public { //decreases counter by 1  counter--; } function getCounter() public constant returns (uint256) {  return counter;    }  function kill() public { //self-destruct function,    if(msg.sender == owner) {    selfdestruct(owner);         }}We can now go back into Mist and redeploy a new contract with the kill() function added. To see the kill() function in full force, we\u2019re going to deploy the new contract, send ether to the contract, and then initialize kill() and see our ether return back to our wallet. Likewise, we also need to create a function that is executed whenever our contract receives Ether. In order to receive Ether, a fallback function must be marked payable in the contract. If such a function does not exist, the contract cannot receive Ether. A contract can have exactly one unnamed function, which is going to be the unnamed function that we\u2019ll mark as payable . Add the function below to our contract, the function can be placed below the kill() function.function () public payable {  }Great, now our contract can receive Ether from any wallet that has the contract\u2019s address! Go ahead and click \u201cDeploy\u201d to deploy our new contract and submit your password. Do make sure your miner is running to confirm the transaction. Once complete, go to the contract and click \u201cCopy address\u201d. You will get a warning message reminding you that you\u2019re on a test network, select \u201ccopy anyway\u201d.Let\u2019s Send Some Ether\u2026Awesome, we\u2019ve copied our contract\u2019s address and now we can send over some Ether to test our kill() function. Click on the \u201cSend\u201d tab and copy the contract address into the \u201cto\u201d field. Enter in however much ether you\u2019d like to send for this test, I\u2019m going to send over ~30,000 Ether.You know the routine by now\u2026scroll down and click \u201csend\u201d, turn on your miner, and wait for the transaction to get processed. You should notice right away your wallet no longer holds the ether we sent to the contract. Open the contract AGAIN under your \u201cContracts\u201d tab, you\u2019ll see that the contract now has ether attached to it. Select the kill function under the \u201cSelect function\u201d drop down and go ahead and self-destruct that bad boy. Enter your password, crank that miner. After 12/12 confirmations have been processed, your wallet will be restored with the Ether we sent to the contract. Now the contract is inoperable, but the contract\u2019s history does still exist on the blockchain.All In A Day\u2019s Work\u2026Aaaaaaandddd there you have it. Congrats on finishing the tutorial and having deployed (and killed) your very first smart contract! There is a lot that was covered here, surely somethings are still a bit of a head scratch. That\u2019s okay! You now know how to open a private network, write Solidity code, deploy in Mist & Remix, and interact with it. Plenty more to do and learn now that you know the basics.I hope this tutorial was helpful!

(Oh, no guarantee of course)Introduction (You can skip)It\u2019s impossible to not to hear about Cryptocurrencies related topics nowadays.It seems everyone is already on it, or want to start but not sure where to go, or completely stay away because feels like too late in a game, or too risky.A little bit about me. I\u2019ve worked in the financial industry for over 10 years of my currier in New York City.I was a part of the core development team building a new retail online trading platform at the most prestigious global financial services firm during the Lehman Shock era.Source: USA TodayThen lead the multiple cross-region teams for the implementation of a global market platform at the US headquarters of the largest Japanese bank.During this time, I\u2019ve learned basics of how the trading system works.Despite my exposure to many different trading systems and financial products, I\u2019ve never tried any short-term / long-term tradings myself, \u2014 until the arrival of cryptocurrencies...It was simply too tempting to miss this hype \u2014 the world phenomenon: the era of cryptocurrencies.Source: Daily BeastI was barely noticing when Crypt-trading was becoming popular among \u201ccrypt early adopters\u201d before Mid-2017.Bitcoin \u2014 Priced at around 2,500 USD at June 2017 (Coinbase.com)Bitcoin hits 4,500 USD in Aug 2017. At that time, like most people, I was rather skeptical about the whole thing.I even missed another opportunity \u2014 when Bitcoin price jumped to 10,000 USD in Nov 2017, then skyrocketed to $19,000 USD within a couple of weeks and bounced back to $14,000 USD at the end of 2017.\u2014 I only started mid-December 2017, which was pretty bad time to start\u2026How to start trading cryptocurrencies (If you don\u2019t know how)It\u2019s not difficult to start trading cryptocurrencies at all.You can google \u201chow to trade cryptocurrency\u201d and find sites like this one for easy reading.How to trade cryptocurrency: Simple tips to get started | finder.comCryptocurrencies are exploding. Between January and November 2017, bitcoin (BTC) grew from $997.69/BTC to $9,718/BTC\u2026www.finder.comYou need a credit card or bank account to put money in your crypto wallet (crypto wallet is like a checking account for cryptocurrency with a lot of volatility!!).In my case, I first sign up on \u201cCoinbase\u201d like many others. Coinbase was one of the easiest and trusted place to buy your first cryptocurrencies \u2014 in my case, a fraction* of one bitcoin at the price around 14,000 USD per coin.*don\u2019t invest more than your can afford to lose it all, because there is a very real chance that you actually lose the most.Coinbase - Buy/Sell Digital CurrencyCoinbase is a secure online platform for buying, selling, transferring, and storing digital currency.www.coinbase.comAfter purchasing tiny amount of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). I was soon bored with the limited capabilities/options at Coinbase, so I sign up for Binance \u2014 a Chinese digital asset exchange.Binance has more than 100 cryptocurrencies to trade with. You first need to deposit to your wallet, either Bitcoin or Ethereum to start trading with other coins. I sent Ethereum from Coinbase to Binance wallet.You can check this blog entry from Rusty Shackleford for how to sign up for Binance in detail.The Ultimate Beginner\u2019s Guide to Binance Exchange: Buy/Sell CryptocurrencySo you\u2019ve decided to step into the world of cryptocurrency. You\u2019ve bought your first Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) or\u2026medium.comMethod explained \u2014 Long-term hold with Short-term value dipsMy method consists of a long-term holding of multiple coins and short-term value dippings each day.This method takes full benefits of current growing cryptocurrency market caps and requires only few minutes each day for setting up dip coins for the day (low maintenance).It basically relays on the long-term growth of whole cryptocurrency market capitalization, but it could be more profitable and more resistant to \u201ccrush\u201d than simple long-term hold due to the diversities, daily value dipping, and safety net.In this method, you will have 4 categories of coins:(1) Base Coin \u2014 either Bitcoin and/or Ethereum for purchasing other coins.(2) Long-term Hold Coins* \u2014 Your selection of coins that has long-term values that you believe. In my case, BTC, ETH, NEO, RPX, IOTA, and TRX. More diverse the better. [*Update: Move these coins from Exchange to Personal wallet with your private key](3) Short-term Dip Coins \u2014 Your daily selection of coins for short-term value gain of 3%+ each. It also serves to monitor where the market is going overall since it forces you to look at many different coins and its performance.(4) Safety net Coin/Account* \u2014 Tether (USDT), Each USDT unit is backed by a U.S Dollar held in the reserves of the Tether Limited. This is still a cryptocurrency, but it has very low day to day volatilities. [*Update: To be completely safe, deposit to your original bank account. There is a risk of putting your money in Tether]You start with (1) Base Coin, then buy (2) Long-term Hold Coins and hold on to them through its good (ups) and bad (downs) time.Each day you buy small portions of (3) Short-term Dip Coins and sell for quick profits and re-invest the profits to all categories. Repeat.Execution Step 1 \u2014 Initial SetupLet\u2019s get into the action. Assuming you already have some Base Coin wallets setup (in my case, Ethereum) at some crypto exchange (in my case Binance).You open the trade screen and start picking and purchasing the coins you want to hold for a long-term. The current price doesn\u2019t really matter since you hold them long enough (although, it is definitely better to buy when it is cheaper of course).Depending on your confidence level, you can put more portion of your total asset into each Long-term hold coins. In any case, you should always start small and continue research on the coins you hold.You want to be sensitive to the future value of these coins. You may subscribe to cryptocurrency related news. I use Crypto Pro iOS app for reading news.My selections of these long-term hold coins at the time of Mid-December 2017 were ETH, BTC, NEO, RPX, and TRX in order of confidence.If I start fresh now, maybe I will pick something else, but I still want ETH to be my \u201cGo-To\u201d coin.Use different timescales to feel the market trend (Binance Trade Application)Execution Step 2 \u2014 Daily Value DipYou are looking for a short-term gain, not necessarily long-term value of the coin for the purpose. You will be looking at few characteristics of the coin for the selection.I am gonna state the obvious here \u2014 You make a profit when you sell higher than what you paid for.I have couple of suggestions for picking the right (higher probability of short-term gain) coins.Binance Trade Application Screen(1) look at the coins that lost values last 24 hours \u2014 Sort by % changes(2) look at 24 hr High/Low and Current Value to see if it\u2019s closer to Low side(3) look at the yellow line and if the current price is below the line(4) look at the Buy(green)/Sell(red) turned for Buy(green bar) sideIf you picked coins that meet all or some of these criteria, chances are much higher than random pick.If you don\u2019t see the coins fits this criteria. Just try at other time of the day.Do not buy a lot, just buy little at a time. When you buy, use Limit* order, don\u2019t buy at Market price. This way you have more control.*You may have more sophisticated options depending on the trading platformTo further improve your pick and confidence level, there are few more things you can check before you invest more.Check the trend by looking at the different timescale (longer than couple of hours).Binance Trade Application Screen with \u201cMutl-Invl\u201dThe image (above) shows \u201cMDA/ETH\u201d in different timescale graph (\u201cMutl-Invl\u201d).If you just look at time scale less than 1 mins interval (\u201cTime\u201d interval), you may pick this product as there was a recent value drop from the yellow line.However, if you look at the lifetime value of this product (\u201c1d\u201d interval), you notice that this product have never exceeded the initial value in this exchange. So you may avoid this product, as you can\u2019t determine the peak value of this product.Another consideration is, a trade volume. If you look at 24h volume, this product was not traded much. More trade volume is better for the short-term gain purpose.Binance Trade Application Screen with \u201cMutl-Invl\u201dOne more example, the image (above) shows \u201cPIVX/ETH\u201d trade and notice this product just came to this exchange. You may avoid trading till the price settle for this product.After you buy, set up Sell Limit order with 3%+(enough to make profit after transaction fees if any) higher value and leave it there for a day or longer.You will pick other coins, and repeat the same process.When you do this every day, it shouldn\u2019t take more than couple of minutes. If you are not sure the picks for the day, then don\u2019t buy or buy very small for a test run.Next day, you look at the open orders if any of these are filled, you made a quick profit, you can re-invest it to other categories.if some or many of the open orders are not filled yet (most likely), don\u2019t worry. Just let it sit there, till they clear (there is an advance topic on this, but may be next time).Pick another few coins, set up Sell \u201cLimit\u201d repeat.You shouldn\u2019t exceed investing more than 25% of your total asset into this category.Short-term trading is by nature, a gamble. but if you play it right (by the rule), you will have a higher chance of winning, just like a Black Jake and Poker.Another important aspect of this daily dipping is \u2014 it works as a daily check point of assessing what you hold and where the market is heading to.Through the bad time, and good time.The market sometimes crashes for a very little or no reason, which happens all the time.If you sense the market is going south through your trusted sources (regulatory news etc.), you move a higher portion of your total assets to Safety Net. However, chances are, when you notice the decline, you are too late \u2014 in that case, just hold tight. They usually recover at some point.The market also sometimes goes up \u2014 It\u2019s funny, people don\u2019t usually look for reasons why the price went up ;-)You feel pretty good looking at coins reporting all +10x% in green, then \u2014 you get greedy\u2026 soon after this, usually the price swings back, so when you see the green, take the profit in Safety Net.It is important to recover your initial investment as soon as you make profits \u2014 once you paid off, then you can truly enjoy the growth of your crypto-asset from the pure profits.Last but not least \u2014 TaxationI haven\u2019t quite figure out how to report recognize gain or loss.According to this article, it looks like we all need to track every single transactions for the calculation. Both Coinbase and Binance can download historical transaction records.I have a vested interest in BlockChain technology in conjunction with IoT (Internet of Things). I will write something next time!Meanwhile, let me know what you think about this method.Love to hear your opinions/suggestions!See you next time, Tack T.", "responses": 43, "tags": ["Bitcoin", "Cryptocurrency", "IoT", "Internet of Things", "Blockchain"]}, {"title": "The Year in Ethereum", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@jjmstark/the-year-in-ethereum-87a17d6f8276?source=search_post", "author_name": "Josh Stark", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@jjmstark", "publish_date": "2019-01-16", "last_modified_date": "2019-01-17", "readtime": "21.7", "claps": 9010, "voters": 538, "content": "The Year in EthereumJosh StarkFollowJan 16 \u00b7 22 min readby Josh Stark, Evan Van Ness, and Daniel ZakrissonEthereum began as a bold experiment. Can we build a universal platform for digital money and assets, un-censorable applications, and decentralized organizations?We started with a slightly smaller experiment: was it possible to launch a blockchain that could execute arbitrary programs? Over time, the Ethereum community began new experiments. Would developers find it interesting? What applications are actually useful? The community learned from its successes and failures, and iterated on their work. New people joined the community and started running their own experiments.In 2018, the Ethereum community ran more experiments than ever before. What did we learn? This summary of the year in Ethereum is our attempt to identify the most important developments \u2014 the things that we\u2019ll say mattered, 10 years out.These developments took place at every level of the Ethereum \u201cstack\u201d. This includes the core protocol and the clients that implement it, commonly referred to as \u201cLayer 1\u201d. It includes the supporting developer tools & infrastructure, that make engineering on Ethereum possible. It includes \u201coff chain\u201d technologies, that let developers build fast and performant applications. And it includes the products and businesses built on Ethereum.Keeping track of everything in this ecosystem is becoming more and more difficult every week. There are competing implementations of many infrastructure technologies \u2014 including two clients with ~50% (Geth) and ~40% (Parity) of the network. There are multiple competing off-chain technology stacks being built, multiple ETH 2.0 clients under development, and most markets have multiple competing businesses. It feels messy and chaotic \u2014 the Ethereum ecosystem is a bazaar, not a cathedral. While this can make it hard to follow, it\u2019s a credit to the community: we\u2019re too big to measure with simple tools.Our goal is to help you sort through that noise and see the bigger picture. In our view, here are the most important developments in 2018:1. More people started using Ethereum, for more things \u2014 but we\u2019re still far from mass adoption.2. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and stablecoins \u2014 a new class of applications that saw many product launches and some breakout successes.3. The year of #BUIDL \u2014 it became radically easier to build applications on Ethereum. Our development and security tooling improved significantly, we got better at sharing best practices, and hackathons became a trend.4. Layer 2 scaling \u2014 multiple \u201clayer 2\u201d applications launched, and we made critical progress towards making these scaling solutions easy to use for developers.5. Zero knowledge technology \u2014 this year it felt like every technical conversation in Ethereum was \u201cWe can do it this way right now, but of course once we have good zkSTARKs\u2026\u201d6. ETH 2.0 / Serenity \u2014 the roadmap solidified, and it moved from a research project to an engineering effort.1. Did adoption of Ethereum grow in 2018?From 2015\u20132017, it was an open question whether there would ever be any demand for Ethereum. Today, that answer feels settled: since late 2017, the Ethereum blockchain has continued to be used near maximum capacity:Source: Google Bigquery Ethereum public datasetThis graph shows the utilization of the Ethereum blockchain at different points in time. Specifically, it is a measure of the total gas used divided by the gas limit. When the line approaches 1, it means the Ethereum blockchain is being used at nearly 100% capacity.Yes, the graph above is encouraging \u2014 people are paying to use the Ethereum blockchain. But it means we started asking harder questions: we\u2019re near 100% capacity even with such a small user base? What would happen to fees if we on-boarded millions of users, when the total capacity of the network is so low? How many people actually use Ethereum? What are they using it for? And what are the right metrics to measure growth?Measuring \u201cuse\u201d of Ethereum isn\u2019t easy. For instance, we can get a basic picture using raw on-chain statistics, like the number of transactions on the network:Source: https://etherscan.io/chart/txBut this doesn\u2019t tell the whole story. If Ethereum was being used near full capacity, how can the number of transactions be declining? The composition of transactions on Ethereum shifted from a large number of simple ones, to a smaller number of complex ones. For instance, token transfers (~50K gas) or opening up a MakerDAO CDP (up to 900K gas) both \u201ctake up\u201d more of the network\u2019s capacity than a simple ETH transfer (21K gas).As Ethereum\u2019s app layer continues to grow, we should expect the transaction count to decline while the chain operates at full capacity. And as more activity moves into side chains, state channels, or plasma chains (see Layer 2), measuring on-chain transactions increasingly only tell part of the story.What are people using the network for?Many significant and long-awaited applications went live in 2018, and appear to be attracting users.Dai, the stablecoin launched by MakerDAO, has been live since late 2017, and the total supply of Dai grew to 69m as of December 31st, 2018.Source: mkr.toolsUsers of MakerDAO have locked more than 1.7% of all ether into smart-contracts that serve as collateral for the Dai stablecoin. As of December 31st, the value of that ether was over $275 million. We discuss MakerDAO, and other \u201cdecentralized finance\u201d applications, in detail in the next section.Augur, a decentralized prediction market under development since 2015, launched in July 2018 and has seen open interest (the amount of value currently \u201cbet\u201d on the system) grow to a high over over $2.96m in November 2018. However, the total number of users has remained low.Spankchain, a payment channels service for the adult entertainment industry, launched in April 2018 and processed $70,000 in payments to performers between April and December 2018.Many more applications launched in 2018, including many in the \u201cdecentralized finance\u201d category (see next section). Many others were games like Gods Unchained (beta, November 2018), or gambling services like FunFair (mainnet, September 2018). There are hundreds of other applications that use the Ethereum blockchain, which you can find listed here or here.Overall, consumer use of applications on Ethereum remains low. When we use measurements like daily active users who interact with a dapp\u2019s smart-contract on the blockchain, we see an average of between 10,000\u201315,000 users on any given day in 2018.However, note that this is a measurement of on-chain transactions and does not include, for example, someone opening an app and browsing their collectibles, or opening Veil (alpha, September 2018, mainnet January 15 2019) to view their open predictions on Augur.User adoption of new technology moves in phases. Users come to applications, creating demand for better infrastructure, and applications then build on that infrastructure to meet the expectations of users. We can analogize from web development that there is a reinforcing loop of app and infrastructure development.By the end of 2017, we had learned that there was demand from people who wanted to build applications on Ethereum. In 2018, the community shipped apps that were useful without scaling upgrades, and built infrastructure that will make it possible for the next wave of applications to work at a larger scale.What should we be measuring, anyways?Is \u201cdaily active on-chain transactions\u201d the right measurement to quantify user adoption? This year, people started thinking (and tweeting) about what metrics we should use to gauge Ethereum\u2019s success.The answer, surely, is that it depends on what counts as success. Some businesses require large numbers of users (like consumer apps or games), while others seek high volumes of value (like some financial services).As layer 2 scaling technologies are adopted, more user activity will move \u201coff-chain\u201d where it is more difficult to measure. This already influences the data used to measure Ethereum\u2019s adoption. For instance, DappRadar does not currently include statistics on games that use Loom\u2019s Dappchains, nor does it list activity in Spankchain\u2019s payment channels.But this isn\u2019t a bug, it\u2019s a feature. We want to build web 3 \u2014 an internet that, among other things, respects user\u2019s privacy instead of spying on them. That means giving users the option to keep their business to themselves, off-chain, where it isn\u2019t easy to measure and incorporate into statistics.2. The Year of DeFiThis year we talked about a new narrative within the larger set of Ethereum applications. Many projects launched which were explicitly financial \u2014 applications or protocols that give users new tools with which to manage and use Ethereum-based money or assets. As a group, these became known as \u201cDecentralized Finance\u201d or \u201cDeFi\u201d.There are now companies building out a stack of financial primitives \u2014 the basic building blocks of a financial system. While these tools are in very early stages, it is possible today to use Ethereum-based protocols to take out loans, to lend money and earn a return, to buy bundles of assets, to hedge your risk, to trade assets trustlessly, and to make payments for zero fees. Because these systems are largely open and interoperable, it is becoming possible to combine them in useful ways, building applications that can borrow, lend, and invest simply by calling an API.Within this category there are stablecoins (Dai, mainnet December 2017), lending tools (Dharma, mainnet May 2018, Marble, mainnet beta July 2018), margin trading and derivatives products (Daxia, mainnet January 2018, dYdX, mainnet October 2018, bZx, mainnet September 2018, Market Protocol, testnet November 2018, UMA, under development), bundled investment products (Set Protocol, mainnet June 2018), money market protocols (Compound, mainnet September 2018), credit default swaps (CDx, under development), token swap services (Kyber Network, mainnet February 2018), subscription payment services (8x, testnet October 2018), payment channel hubs (Connext, mainnet September 2018), and prediction markets (Augur, mainnet July 2018, Gnosis PM, alpha December 2017).Over the last year, the share of ETH \u201clocked up\u201d (e.g. used as collateral) in the smart-contracts of some DeFi applications has grown:Source: https://mikemcdonald.github.io/eth-defi/The above graph hides MakerDAO by default, in order to let us see other applications. If we include MakerDAO, the graph looks like this:The most successful DeFi protocol \u2014 and the most successful application on Ethereum in 2018 \u2014 is MakerDAO.Over the last year Dai survived a 94% fall in the value of its underlying collateral. The system was battle-tested in the first few months of its launch, and appears to have functioned as intended. It has quickly became a core piece of infrastructure for many Ethereum applications.Within the community of people that actually use Ethereum apps on a regular basis, it\u2019s hard to overstate the impact of having an easy to use, decentralized stablecoin. If you work in this ecosystem, you will remember that 12 months ago you probably sometimes paid, and were paid, in ETH. Today, everyone uses Dai \u2014 for contract payments, for event sponsorships, for petty cash.MakerDAO is not just Dai, though that is the most outward-facing product. It also includes a system of \u201cCollateralized Debt Positions\u201d (CDPs), which allows anyone to lock up ETH as collateral and receive a \u201cloan\u201d in DAI. This system facilitates the collateral backing that makes Dai possible, while also being a lending product in its own right that can be used for, among other things, leveraged trading.Dai is not the only stablecoin built on Ethereum \u2014 though it is the only one of significant size that is \u201cdecentralized\u201d in the sense that it is backed by digital assets in an automated collateral system, rather than off-chain assets like dollars held in fiat bank accounts. Other Ethereum-based stablecoins include TrueUSD (mainnet March 2018), Paxos (mainnet October 2018), Gemini Dollar (mainnet October 2018), USD Coin (mainnet October 2018), and sUSD (mainnet June 2018).Collectively, all stablecoins built on Ethereum had a marketcap of ~770 million at the end of the year, large enough that as a group they would have ranked as the 14th largest cryptocurrency on Dec 31.https://stablecoinindex.comIn the last 10 days of 2018, these stablecoins had an average daily trading volume of ~$200 million.https://stablecoinindex.comWhile significant and growing, this volume is still dwarfed by trading volume in Tether, which during the same period saw a daily average of around $5 billion USD.Within the broader category of DeFi, decentralized exchanges (DEXs) are the next most significant. In 2018, this ecosystem grew and matured. There are not just multiple competing DEXs, but multiple types of DEXs now live in production. However, volume remains low compared to any centralized exchange.There are now several DEXs that use the 0x protocol. Radar Relay launched their beta in August 2017, raised a series A in July 2018, and released v2 of their product a few months ago in September. Paradex launched October 2017, and was acquired by Coinbase in May 2018. DDEX launched their open beta on January 9 2018, became the leading 0x relayer by volume, and recently announced that they are forking the 0x protocol to create a competing protocol called Hydro.This year saw an expansion of the type of DEXs built on Ethereum. Kyber, which launched in March 2018, does away with the order book and simply lets users receive a quote, and instantly swap one asset for another. Airswap, which launched in April 2018, similarly provides a simple \u201ctoken swap\u201d service. Uniswap, which implements a novel automated market-making feature inspired by a reddit post from a few years back, launched in November 2018. It operates entirely on-chain, and makes markets itself using a deterministic algorithm. Gnosis\u2019 DutchX protocol went live on mainnet in October 2018, with a user-interface to the protocol called slow.trade that went live in December. StarkWare started working on zero-knowledge technology that will help scale DEXs and is expecting to launch on testnet in Q1 2019.Why did DeFi take off in 2018? One reason is that many of these applications are useful today, even before critical scaling technologies are in place. Basic financial use-cases like lending and borrowing do not require high transaction throughput \u2014 they simply require a secure programmable base layer blockchain. Ethereum\u2019s simplest use-case is the creation, exchange, and use of digital assets like ETH. One way of looking at DeFi is that it is simply building the basic financial infrastructure to use those digital assets.3. The year of BUIDL \u2014 better tools, better frameworks, more hacking2018 was the year of #BUIDLing. This was the year that it became radically easier to get started building applications on Ethereum.Developer tools improved, new security tools were released, key frameworks were released, and hackathons became a fixture in the community. In 2018, the vision of average developers being able to build something useful on Ethereum became a reality, and the tooling necessary to use smart contracts in production improved.We even gained a new meme to go along with the technical progress: BUIDL. While the term \u2014 an inversion of the bitcoin meme \u201cHODL\u201d \u2014 had been used by different people over the years, it never gained any real traction until ETHDenver in February 2018. In the weeks following, it became an unofficial mantra for the Ethereum community \u2014 a reaction against the unhealthy focus on price and speculation common across the crypto industry.Developer tools & frameworksIn 2018 developer tooling continued to improve. It\u2019s still not easy to build on Ethereum, and there\u2019s a long way to go \u2014 but it\u2019s much better than it was in December 2017.One notable trend is that we saw alternatives and competitors to popular tools start to emerge. In 2018 ethers.js saw wider adoption as a web3.js alternative, blockscout launched as an open-source alternative to etherscan, the new Goerli testnet launched, and several Truffle competitors emerged like embark, etherlime (based on ethers.js), and buidler.Truffle monthly downloads since 2015 (https://www.truffleframework.com/dashboard)Vyper \u2014 a security-oriented development language that serves as an alternative to solidity \u2014 saw significant progress in 2018. In 2017 it was not production ready and still not that easy to get started with it. Today it is being used in production by Uniswap.We also made progress on important patterns and development frameworks for smart-contracts, like the Proxy Upgrade pattern maintained by Open Zeppelin which is widely used across the ecosystem. Aragon, a framework for creating Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) launched on mainnet this year.Open Zeppelin weekly downloads since 2016Security toolingAt the end of 2017, security tooling & best practices were on everyone\u2019s mind. Multiple high profile hacks and security failures forced the Ethereum community to improve best practices, and invest more resources in security audits and tooling.In 2018, the Ethereum security community improved. New security tools became available that made it easier to build secure applications. Trail of Bits released several tools in March 2018 (who also maintain a useful list of resources here), including static analysis tools, fuzzing tools, and more. Securify, an automated security scanner for Ethereum smart contracts, was released in July 2018. Mythril, a security analysis tool initially released in 2017, became a platform and re-branded to MythX.The Ethereum security community made progress towards \u201cbest practices\u201d, though the community doesn\u2019t always agree on all of them. Valuable resources like the Smart Contract Weakness registry helped the industry share best practices and common anti-patterns. Notable \u201ctraditional\u201d security researchers began working in the Ethereum space, including Trail of Bits and Sigma Prime, adding to the stable of high-quality auditing firms already working in the space.Despite this progress, there\u2019s still significant work required. In particular better formal verification frameworks and tooling, which is a consistent complaint from developers building on Ethereum.InfrastructureEthereum\u2019s primary clients \u2014 Geth and Parity \u2014 continued to be improved and refined, thanks to essential work by their development teams. New clients were released, like Pantheon in Java and Nethermind in .NET Core.There has long been an understanding that Ethereum needs to diversify the node infrastructure available to application developers. This market has long been dominated by Infura, but in 2018 many teams began working on alternatives.Dappnode, a project to make it cheap & easy to run a personal Ethereum node, launched in July (you can even buy a pre-configured one). VIP node, a service that allows users to \u201csubscribe\u201d to node access thereby creating an incentive for more full nodes, went live this year. Denode, a project that similarly seeks to provide market incentives for more decentralized node infrastructure, received a grant from the Ethereum Foundation in September. Other projects \u2014 like LightJS by Parity, released in November \u2014 make it easier for developers to build dapps that don\u2019t need to rely on full nodes.Decentralized storage solutions like IPFS and Swarm continued to make progress. Swarm POC3 was released in June, and now includes a messaging layer. The Ethereum Name Service (ENS), a decentralized service that lets people use human-readable names (like alice.eth) in place of Ethereum addresses, launched a mainnet integration with the .xyz domain registry (September 2018), and announced a planned integration with .luxe.Developer collaboration across the ecosystem improvedThe global community of Ethereum researchers & developers got better at working with each other in 2018. The primary forum for cryptoeconomic research on Ethereum \u2014 ethresear.ch \u2014 only launched in August 2017, and was not widely used until early 2018. Today it is the de-facto R&D hub for Ethereum, and an essential technical resource for everything from plasma to sharding.The very first Plasma researcher\u2019s call didn\u2019t happen until January 2018, and the first state channels researcher calls weren\u2019t until August 2018. There are now many public calls related to Ethereum development, ranging from core development of the protocol, to layer 2 tech, to individual areas like curation markets or product management.The ETHSecurity community formed in mid 2018 to try and share best practices and shared learnings. The fellowship of Ethereum magicians \u2014 a community of Ethereum developers aimed at producing better EIPs and improving Ethereum\u2019s technical maintenance \u2014 launched in early 2018.Gitcoin, a project that facilitates bounties for open-source development, launched their pilot in November 2017. In 2018, their platform was used to pay out ~$500,000 in bounties and grants to more than 700 developers.Hackathons became a big dealIn October 2017 ETHWaterloo set a record as the largest Ethereum hackathon ever, which was quickly beaten by ETHDenver in February 2018. Over the rest of the year, there were 6 more ETHGlobal hackathons that served more than 5,800 developers, as well as other events like ETHMemphis and two hackathons held by Status.In 2018 it was finally practical to run an Ethereum hackathon \u2014 there were enough developers who wanted to learn how to build on this tech, the ecosystem was varied enough that they had many interesting projects to work on, and the tools were mature enough that it was actually feasible to build a working demo in 36 hours. Many of the individual projects mentioned above \u2014 including the Goerli testnet, Set protocol, Denode, and Cryptokitties were conceived or launched at ETHGlobal events.4. Layer 2: research, development, and live on mainnetOne of the early narratives about 2018 is that it would be the year of Ethereum\u2019s layer 2 scalability solutions.The idea behind layer 2 scalability is to off-load computation from Ethereum onto \u201coff chain\u201d systems, while still retaining a blockchain\u2019s characteristic security guarantees. These off-chain systems can process transactions faster and more efficiently than the Ethereum main-chain, leading to more scalable payments or smart-contracts.In 2017, there were no significant state channel or plasma chain projects live on mainnet, and few people understood the technology or its potential. What happened in 2018?State & Payment ChannelsState channels are the most basic layer 2 technique. At the start of 2018, there were several custom-built channels applications still under development. Today, many of those projects have launched to main-chain, and critical infrastructure has been built that will soon radically shorten the development cycle for channelized solutions.Spankchain (micropayments through payment channels) launched their beta in April, and have been live in production ever since. Funfair (casino games running in state channels) launched to mainnet in September. Connext (payment channel hubs for micropayments) launched their first non-custodial hub on mainnet in September in collaboration with Spankchain. Celer Network (a state channel network & liquidity solution) launched their testnet & demo apps in October. Raiden, the long-anticipated ERC20 payment channel network, launched their alpha release running live on mainnet in December.The number of live projects using channels will only increase as the technology becomes easier for developers to use. Counterfactual (a framework that makes it easier to build a channelized application) published their work on generalized state channels in June, open-sourced all their code in November, and is launching a full demo environment in January 2019. Magmo, a framework for a specific subset of channelizable applications (\u201cforce move games\u201d) using state channels, released a demo application at DevconIV.PlasmaPlasma is a scaling technique where operations are moved off-chain into a secondary blockchain, where they can be performed faster and at lower cost.The idea is based on \u201csidechains\u201d, originally a proposal to scale bitcoin dating back to 2014. Plasma introduced a novel improvement: unlike on a sidechain, a user of a Plasma chain would always have a guarantee that they can withdraw their assets to main-chain, even if the operator of that Plasma chain tried to censor or steal from them.Plasma research has made large strides since the paper release in August 2017, though the technology remains further from production than state channels. The year began with only a few teams actively working on Plasma, as the research community began to explore various tradeoff and design choices within a family of related techniques derived from the original paper.The majority of these designs have focused on the simplest use case: payments. These designs include Plasma MVP (introduced by Vitalik in January 2018) and Plasma Cash (introduced by Vitalik & Karl in March, and the subject of continuing formal work). More recently, researchers have begun exploring zero-knowledge-proof based Plasma-like designs like the \u201cRollup\u201d (introduced by Barry Whitehat in September).Each of these can be augmented to mitigate their shortcomings, while minimizing tradeoffs. This unfortunately resulted in a \u201cnaming meme\u201d, where each new tweak on an existing design was given a unique name, leading to significant confusion for anyone not deeply involved in the research community. Useful taxonomies that divide up the design space are a work in progress.At the same time, research continued into expanding Plasma beyond payments. While this work continues, current consensus among researchers is that an optimized \u201cfull EVM\u201d plasma (which could run any smart contract) is a complex challenge.This broad exploration of a large design space has been productive for researchers, but practical implementations are still mostly theoretical or in early stages. One exception is the Plasma Cash implementation built by Loom, released in June 2018.5. Zero Knowledge is comingOver the past year the Ethereum developer community began to appreciate that new zero-knowledge technology will have a significant impact on blockchain technologies. Over the past 12 months, it has felt like every technical conversation in the Ethereum community takes the form of \u201cwell, we can do it this way for now, but of course once we have good zkSTARKs, it will be like this\u2026\u201d.Most people in the crypto industry will have heard of zero-knowledge tech, most famously used in the privacy cryptocurrency Zcash. But zero-knowledge technology won\u2019t just be used for privacy. It has important implications for many scalability techniques as well. Recent research and development into this technology (specifically, a class of zero-knowledge tech called zkSTARKs) may dramatically lower the computational cost required to use them in production, opening up new opportunities to integrate them with programmable blockchains like Ethereum.In short, zero-knowledge proofs let us prove that some operation happened, without having to share the underlying data. If the verification of that proof can be done cheaply enough, then it could let Ethereum smart-contracts verify that an operation took place off-chain. This means that we could, for instance, conduct large numbers of operations off-chain, and then cheaply verify that they happened. Or, we could conduct intensive computation off-chain, and still have it verified on-chain.2018 was the year that the full potential of zero-knowledge tech started to sink in. In January, Eli Ben-Sasson & his co-authors published their long-awaited paper on zkSTARKs. The Ethereum community began to work on how this technology can be used for scaling and in conjunction with other technologies, like Plasma. On the layer 1 side, developers made plans to ensure that ETH 2.0 has the requisite support for zkSTARKs, like STARK-friendly hash functions.New zkSNARK libraries were released, like iden3\u2019s snarkjs and circom, adding to existing libraries like Zokrates. In December 2018 a team at ETHSingapore built a zkSNARK \u201crollup\u201d scaling proof of concept, later released on testnet as the (not technically Plasma) Plasma Ignis. BarryWhiteHat contributed critical work on using zkSNARKs on Ethereum. And Ben-Sasson & others launched Starkware, a company aimed at commercial applications of zkSTARKs, and received a $4mm grant from the Ethereum Foundation.6. The Road to ETH 2.0ETH 2.0 is the name for the long-term research and development of the Ethereum platform, incorporating fundamental base-layer upgrades like Proof of Stake and Sharding.The history of ETH 2.0, aka Serenity, has featured false starts, dead ends and more false starts. But in 2018, the long-term Ethereum roadmap began to solidify.In January 2018, the FFG testnet launched, though it suffered from networking issues that made it difficult to use. A few months later however, the research direction moved away from FFG, and towards a plan that would see Casper and Sharding implemented together. In Q2, consensus began to form around what is now the current plan.Explaining ETH 2.0 is beyond the scope of this post. If you want to get caught up, we recommend EthHub\u2019s summary here, Vitalik\u2019s talk from DevconIV, or James Prestwich\u2019s recent guide.Once the research vision was clear, it was possible to create a specification for what became known as \u201cETH 2.0\u201d. This allowed many different engineering teams to begin implementing that specification into client software. At the end of 2018, there were at least 8 teams building clients for ETH 2.0. Recently, Ben Edgington also began a weekly newsletter which closely tracks the research and implementation of ETH 2.0.While all roadmaps are subject to change and projections are uncertain, the beacon chain is expected to go live in 2019, with a beacon chain testnet scheduled to happen in the next few months. The beacon chain will allow ETH holders to choose to transfer their ETH to the beacon chain in order to earn rewards as a validator. However, that ETH cannot be transferred back to the \u201cETH 1\u201d chain.The next phase will include shards, which will be managed by the beacon chain. It\u2019s also possible that the beacon chain will be used to finalize the current proof of work chain, somewhat similar to the way that FFG was once planned a year ago to be used for finalization.While the roadmap has considerably firmed up, there are still unsolved problems in blockchain sharding. While the first few phases are relatively clear and there are no significant unsolved theoretical problems left, plenty of interesting research and implementation problems remain for future phases so that we get to a truly scalable layer 1 of Ethereum.What did it all mean?We warned you this post would be long. But it\u2019s still not comprehensive. A lot more happened in the Ethereum ecosystem this year, including a few developments worth noting quickly here:Ethereum core developers came to rough consensus on a set of short-term upgrades to the current Ethereum protocol (\u201cEthereum 1.X\u201d), while ETH 2.0 is under developmentRegulators across the world started paying attention to cryptocurrency, including securities regulators. Many jurisdictions are now in the process of deciding how digital assets, like the kind that can be created on Ethereum, are treated under law.Non-plasma sidechain technology, like POA network and Parity-bridge, launched into productionUX made progress, like Universal Logins and meta transactionsThe Ethereum Foundation launched a grants program to fund critical work from across the community.Should we view this year as a success, or a setback?A strange thing about this moment in Ethereum\u2019s history is that you will receive wildly different answers depending on someone\u2019s frame of reference.If your baseline is 2015\u20132016, you remember when Ethereum was still firmly an experiment, with virtually no users, developer tools, or even applications. The contrast with 2018 is startling. There are real applications now, live on mainnet, that provide real utility to their users \u2014 even if those user bases remain small. The thing we believed could happen, which may have once seemed impossible, is starting to happen, in bits and pieces.But if your frame of reference is the hyped up narrative sold to you by ICO whitepapers and glossy keynote conferences, then it must be disappointing. Mass adoption not only has not yet arrived, but remains over the horizon. There are hard problems yet to be solved, and the technical progress zigs and zags, instead of following the comforting straight line of a tidy infographic roadmap.Welcome to the real. There are experiments to be run, lessons to be learned, and hard problems to solve. Grab a shovel, and see you next year.\u2014 Josh Stark (L4), Evan Van Ness (Week in Ethereum, ConsenSys), and Daniel Zakrisson (hardfork.se)Thanks to Georgios Konstantopoulos, Jeff Coleman, Spencer Noon, Alex Wade, Xuanji Li, Danny Ryan, Heather Davidson, Gregor Zavcer, Mike McDonald, Corey Petty, Ameen Soleimani, Jens Frid, and others who took time to answer questions and contribute to the creation of this article.", "responses": 13, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Ethereum", "Cryptocurrency"]}, {"title": "Scalability Tradeoffs: Why \u201cThe Ethereum Killer\u201d Hasn\u2019t Arrived Yet", "post_link": "https://medium.com/loom-network/scalability-tradeoffs-why-the-ethereum-killer-hasnt-arrived-yet-8f60a88e46c0?source=search_post", "author_name": "Georgios Konstantopoulos", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@gakonst", "publish_date": "2018-01-24", "last_modified_date": "2019-08-19", "readtime": "7.51", "claps": 5022, "voters": 522, "content": "Scalability Tradeoffs: Why \u201cThe Ethereum Killer\u201d Hasn\u2019t Arrived YetGeorgios KonstantopoulosFollowJan 24, 2018 \u00b7 8 min readLately I\u2019ve seen a lot of crypto-enthusiasts on Reddit and Telegram making comments like:\u201cBitcoin is slow. It is expensive. There are many new coins, modern ones that are much better. They are fast and inexpensive.\u201dOr the very popular CryptoKitties argument:\u201cEthereum couldn\u2019t even handle CryptoKitties, how do you expect it to be Web3.0?\u201dOr about how Blockhain X is here to turn the tables:\u201c<insert coin ticker> is king, it can handle 60,000 transactions per second, has no fees and it can do smart contracts\u201dThe popular opinion is that the current leaders by market cap are not good enough, and that new projects are offering better features or alternative architectures (Tangle, Hashgraph) that are going to define a new standard and bring the capabilities of blockchains to new levels.While I do not dismiss the possibility of Bitcoin being dethroned in the upcoming years, or that the top-5 might change radically in the future, I believe that we need to be skeptical when a project advertises itself as a do-it-all solution, and rigorously investigate it before jumping to conclusions.There is no silver-bullet that will solve all problems.\u201cTouka Koukan\u201d (\u7b49\u4fa1\u4ea4\u63db) is a Japanese phrase which roughly translates to \u201cequivalent exchange\u201d. Nothing comes for free. There will always be trade offs.Below is the Scalability Trilemma as described by Vitalik Buterin:From https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Sharding-FAQ\u0391 blockchain that claims to have solved the trilemma has either bent the laws of physics (highly unlikely), or it has discovered a breakthrough method that solves the major blockchain scalability problems that have stumped top mathematicians and computer scientists for the past decade.While this is not impossible, a more likely explanation is that the blockchain has sacrificed either decentralization, security, or both.What characterizes a blockchain or a cryptocurrency?What characterizes a blockchain or a cryptocurrency?In my debut article, A rant about Blockchains I provide the following definition of a blockchain:A blockchain is a database that can be shared between a group of non-trusting individuals, without needing a central party to maintain the state of the database.And cryptocurrency from Google dictionary:A digital currency in which encryption techniques are used to regulate the generation of units of currency and verify the transfer of funds, operating independently of a central bank.Note that both definitions (blockchain and cryptocurrency) emphasize the need to operate independently of a central party.The case against (semi-)centralized coinsRippleXRP claims to be \u201cthe fastest and most scalable digital asset, enabling real-time global payments anywhere in the world.\u201d They boast that \u201cXRP consistently handles 1,500 transactions per second, 24x7, and can scale to handle the same throughput as Visa.\u201dHowever, let\u2019s compare XRP\u2019s nodes number to Ethereum and Bitcoin:425 Ripple Nodes around the globe | https://xrpcharts.ripple.com/#/topology11,690 Bitcoin Nodes | https://bitnodes.earn.com/32,383 Ethereum Nodes https://www.ethernodes.org/network/1In addition, Ripple can freeze its users\u2019 funds at any given time[1][2].It may be fast, but Ripple is as centralized as it gets.Masternode CoinsA Masternode is a full cryptocurrency node which can perform extra functions in its blockchain network such as:Participate in governance and votingInstant transactionsPrivate transactions.It is used in cryptocurrencies like DASH and PIVX.In order to be able to run a masternode, you need to put up some amount of cryptocurrency as collateral \u2014 like stake in Proof of Stake \u2014 to disincentivize malicious behavior. In return, you get compensated with a cryptocurrency payout at regular time intervals.The aforementioned features are great, however:A DASH masternode costs 1,000 DASH ($1,000,000)A PIVX masternode costs 10,000 PIVX (~$110,000)The high financial barrier of entry translates to a certain degree of centralization which as discussed before, breaks the requirement of decentralization.In order to maintain decentralization there needs to be a low barrier of entry for individuals to join and contribute to the network \u2014 This directly relates to the Bitcoin Civil war for the block size increase.Permissioned or Private BlockchainsI will skip over this category completely since by definition this is a centralized setup. A highly recommended comparison on Public vs Private blockchains can be found here.I also want to emphasize that a blockchain claiming to achieve a high number of transactions in a testnet does not mean that performance will translate if/when it is deployed as a public blockchain.Zero / Ultra Low transaction feesWhat if a coin claims to have zero transaction fees?In order to keep the network secure, there is a need for verifying entities who create new blocks and maintain the network.Why would these entities support the network and not try to attack it?There needs to be an incentivizing method for them to do this task honestly without trying to game the network. That incentivizing method is transaction fees and block rewards. Since block rewards are slowly diminishing (e.g. block reward halving in Bitcoin) miner incentives are directly linked to transaction fees.It is impossible to have a truly decentralized network with 0 fees as there would be no incentive to maintain it.What about coins that have ultra low transaction fees?I will rebut this argument with an example from Ethereum:An Ether transfer costs 21,000 gas. Let\u2019s say you want your transaction to be confirmed fast, so after consulting ethgasstation.info you set the gas price at 50Gwei/gas, resulting in total transaction fees of 0.00105 Ether.If you made the transaction in Jan 13, 2018 (\u039e1=$1,400) it would cost $1.47.If you made the transaction in Jan 15, 2017 (\u039e1=$10) it would cost $0.01.Transaction fees (given that the calculation method stays the same) are constant when denominated in the native currency (\u039e1=\u039e1 always). A multifold increase in a coin\u2019s price, implies a multifold increase in transaction fees when denominating in fiat currency.When arguing that Coin X has $Y transaction fees when evaluated at $Z per coin, think about what Y will be if Z becomes 100*Z.Corollary: Most coins that claim to be cheaper than Bitcoin or Ethereum can only do so because they have very low transaction volume.The increase of a coin\u2019s price and transaction volume are positively correlated with an increase in that coin\u2019s transaction fees.Consensus AlgorithmsBoth Bitcoin and Ethereum use Proof of Work, the most widely-used consensus algorithm since the inception of cryptocurrencies. If you are not familiar with how Proof of Work and consensus algorithms I refer you to my previous articles [1][2]There have been many attempts at alternative Proofs of {Something} in order to tackle the deficiencies of PoW, most notably with Proof of Stake.Taking Bitshares or Steem as an example, they both use Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) as their consensus algorithm (not to be confused with Cardano\u2019s DPoS algorithm).Think of DPoS as representative democracy. Instead of voting directly on an issue (on a block), you delegate your voting power to trusted \u201cdelegates\u201d who will use that power to take a decision (mine a block) for the masses. This in turn allows less overhead and enables much higher transaction throughput. However, it is less decentralized because there are only a handful of delegates who hold the majority of the decision-making power, and power is corruptible.There are valid use cases for DPoS: Steemit, for example, is a successful platform with performance comparable to traditional web servers, despite running on its own blockchain. Most of its value transfers are micro-transactions, so sacrificing decentralization and security is a fair tradeoff to make in order to achieve such high levels of scalability and performance.However, for a cryptocurrency storing large amounts of value, or a platform that handles smart contracts that must be trusted by third parties, it is far more secure to use a fully decentralized PoW chain.At Loom Network, we think blockchains like this are best implemented as application-specific sidechains, where the sidechain security is maintained by the main chain.What about Tangle or Hashgraph?TangleIOTA uses a totally different system from a blockchain, based on a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), called the Tangle.Essentially the Tangle\u2019s transactions have no timestamps (which means you cannot do complex smart contracts on them which rely on X happening before Y) and they tackle the double spend problem by referencing two previously confirmed transactions.https://iota.org/IOTA_Whitepaper.pdf pg.10This looked particularly promising until MIT Researchers found a critical vulnerability in the curl hash function that IOTA created. Additionally, the IOTA foundation (like Ripple), has also frozen user funds in the past.Also since this is a fee-less system, as discussed before, there is no incentive to run a full node.HashgraphHashgraph is also a relatively new concept which is described in depth here:Demystifying Hashgraph: Benefits and ChallengesRecently, on our Zilliqa social channels a number of people have asked us to take a look at Hashgraph. So, here is what\u2026hackernoon.comHowever, as said by the Hashgraph team in their Telegram channel, it is currently deployed only in a permissioned network. This again breaks the requirement for decentralization since it\u2019s private; however, it might have a valid use case in corporate environments. It is probably too early to know if it will find its way to public networks.ConclusionMy previous arguments are aimed towards the politics and the proper design of community-driven blockchains.I do not believe that XRP, Masternode coins and private blockchains are cursed and should be avoided. Each has its use case.However, they are inherently more centralized and should not be mistaken for a truly decentralized, impossible-to-censor and unstoppable cryptocurrency.Regarding new experimental algorithms and network topologies, I really hope they are able to sustain the scalability they claim they can achieve, without ultimately sacrificing decentralization or security.It\u2019s too early to get overly excited about these platforms (and declare them the \u201cEthereum killer\u201d) until they have proven themselves at scale.Further reading:[1] The Meaning of Decentralization.[2] Blockchains don\u2019t scale.

This is very rare.Most ICO projects never make or release a blockchain project for their cryptocurrency.CoTrader aims to disrupt the $85 trillion global investment funds industry with the world\u2019s first trustless blockchain funds marketplace.CoTrader enables investors, called CoTraders, to invest with the best, and have their crypto funds managed by the best fund managers. Unlike in competing platforms, CoTraders always have control over their assets.

Fund managers can only make trades to swap different assets in the Smart Funds, but can never withdraw anyone else\u2019s funds. That is, unlike anytime before in history, investors don\u2019t need to give up control of their funds to have them managed.Fund managers can choose a performance fee and compete for CoTrader funds in an open marketplace. For example, if a fund manager sets a 20% performance fee, and turns 10 ETH into 100 ETH, he\u2019d keep 20 ETH. Investors, or CoTraders, that see his past ROI of 10x, and agree to his 20% fee, can send ETH to his Smart Fund. Fees and ROI reporting is then assured by transparent smart contracts.Network effects: fund managers and influencers are strongly incentivized to do their best for their CoTraders, and spread the word, to multiply their investing leverage. If a top trader is managing 1000x their own funds, and charges 10% performance fee, he\u2019s 100x his normal earnings. If the manager would earn just 2x over some period of time, he\u2019d earn 200x if managing such a large pool.The CoTrader MVP already supports Cryptos, and plans to soon support ICOs, stocks, shorts, options and derivatives. CoTrader can tokenize entire exchanges with it\u2019s Smart Escrow exchange protocol, and can run on any smart contract powered platform, from Ethereum, to EOS, NEO, or Hashgraph.CoTrader pools together the liquidity of many decentralized exchanges (DEXs) such as Kyber, Bancor, 0x and more, to form a Super-DEX for maximim liquidity.Items in CoTrader\u2019s Road Map:CoTrader\u2019s patent-pending technology will hide the trading strategies of fund managers even while cryptographically proving fund fees and past ROIs. The algorithms are protocol-agnostic and can utilize any privacy-preserving smart-contracts mechanisms from zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs like zk-SNARKs, zk-STARKs, Bulletproofs, or ring signatures. The first implementation uses ZK interactive proofs using a hyperledger. CoTrader is working with teams such as Sedicii to implement these capabilities.CoTrader will have its own DEX to trade its funds tokens. Every CoTrader fund has its own tokens. This means that if a fund enters an ICO, to receive ICO futures tokens, CoTraders invested into the fund can trade away the ICO futures before the tokens arrive, in a trustless way.CoTrader will build a Smart Escrow exchange whereby users can trade with the liquidity and variety of any centralized exchange, from the likes of Binance to Ameritrade, with the safety and transparency of a DEX.CoTrader is the investment platform of the future, live now, on the Ethereum testnet. It will be on the mainnet within 2 weeks, in July 2018.Those interested in financial freedom can get tokens and ensure full access to the platform, now.CoTrader COT are a technological requirement, a utility, to hide the trading strategy of fund managers, while still allowing CoTraders to know their ROI. CoTrader will take a small fee from fund managers\u2019 performance fees, which will be used to buy back COT. A CoTrader DAO will manage these COT tokens to progress the platform forward, to future proof the platform.CoTrader\u2019s mission is to increase financial freedom for people all around the world by enabling them to invest with the best, instead of spending 24/7 researching the market in suboptimal investment strategies.

When you interact with the Ethereum blockchain, you are executing transactions and updating it\u2019s state. Have you ever wondered what exactly happens when you execute a transaction in Ethereum? Let\u2019s try to understand it by looking at an example transaction. In this post, we will cover the following.An end to end traversal of an Ethereum transaction starting from your browser/console to the Ethereum network and back to your browser/consoleUnderstand how transactions work when you use a plugin such as Metamask or Myetherwallet instead of running your own nodeWhat to do if you are too paranoid and don\u2019t trust any plugins to execute your transaction?This post assumes that you have a basic understanding of Ethereum and it\u2019s components such as accounts, gas and contracts. Here is a good explanation of these concepts. If you are a developer new to Ethereum, you might find this helpful. You can also learn to build a simple dapp here. This post will make more sense if you have executed few transactions yourself. An example of a transaction is you sending some ether to another person or a contract. Another example is if you have interacted with a dapp. For example, if you go here and buy some tokens, that would be a transaction. If you vote for a candidate, that would be another transaction.1. End to end overview of an Ethereum transactionLet\u2019s take the following contract call as an example and traverse through the entire flow of how this function call/transaction gets executed and gets permanently stored on the blockchain. You can find the entire contract here. At a high level, it\u2019s a voting contract where you initialize a few candidates contesting in an election and anyone can vote for them. The votes will be recorded on the blockchain.Voting.deployed().then(function(instance) {  instance.voteForCandidate('Nick', {gas: 140000, from: web3.eth.accounts[0]}).then(function(r) {    console.log(\"Voted successfully!\")  })})We assume that you have an Ethereum client (Geth or Parity) running locally on your computer which is connected to one of the networks (Testnet or Mainnet) and you have access to the contract address and ABI to execute the transaction.If you have built a dapp, the above code should look familiar. There is a contract called Voting which has already been deployed on to the blockchain. We instantiate that contract and execute a method called voteForCandidate and pass in the candidate name, gas limit for this transaction and the account that executes this transaction. As the name indicates, this function is used to vote for a candidate and the vote is recorded on the blockchain. Below we will try to deconstruct this call and understand everything that happens when you execute this javascript function.1. Construct the raw transaction objectThe voteForCandidate function call is first converted in to a raw transaction (rawTxn) as shown below. Web3js library is used to build the raw transaction object.txnCount = web3.eth.getTransactionCount(web3.eth.accounts[0])var rawTxn = {    nonce: web3.toHex(txnCount),    gasPrice: web3.toHex(100000000000),    gasLimit: web3.toHex(140000),    to: '0x633296baebc20f33ac2e1c1b105d7cd1f6a0718b',    value: web3.toHex(0),    data: '0xcc9ab24952616d6100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000'};Let\u2019s try to understand all the fields in the raw transaction object and how they are set.nonce: Each Ethereum account has a field called nonce to keep track of the total number of transactions that account has executed. Nonce is incremented for every new transaction and this allows the network to know the order in which the transactions need to be executed. Nonce is also used for the replay protection.gasPrice: Price per unit of gas you are willing to pay for this transaction. If you are executing your transaction on the Mainnet, here is a handy website from ETH Gas Station that recommends what you should set the gas price for your transaction to succeed in a reasonable amount of time. Gas prices are current measured in GWei and range from 0.1->100+Gwei. You will learn more about gas price and it\u2019s impact later in this article.gasLimit: Maximum gas you are willing to pay for this transaction. This value insures that in case of an issue executing your transaction (like infinite loop), you account is not drained of all the funds. Once the transaction is executed, any remaining gas is sent back to your account.to: The address to which you are directing this function call. This is the contract address (0x633296baebc20f33ac2e1c1b105d7cd1f6a0718b) of the Voting contract in our case.value: Total Ether you want to send. When we executevoteForCandidate, we are not sending any Ether and so the value is 0. If you were executing a transaction to send Ether to another person or a contract, you would set this value.data: Let\u2019s see how this data field is calculated.You first take the function signature from the ABI voteForCandidate(bytes32)and generate the hash of it.> web3.sha3('voteForCandidate(bytes32)')'0xcc9ab267dda32b80892b2ae9e21b782dbf5562ef3e8919fc17cab72aa7db9d59'You take the first 4 bytes of that hash. So, that would be: 0xcc9ab267.You then take the argument \u2018Nick\u2019 and convert to bytes32 and you get 52616d6100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000You combine the two to get the data payload.2. Sign the TransactionIf you remember, you used web3.eth.accounts[0] to execute the transaction. The Ethereum network needs to know that you actually own that account to make sure someone else doesn\u2019t execute this transaction on your behalf. The way to prove this to the network is by signing the transaction using the private key corresponding to that account. The signed transaction looks like this:const privateKey = Buffer.from('e331b6d69882b4ab4ea581s88e0b6s4039a3de5967d88dfdcffdd2270c0fd109', 'hex')const txn = new EthereumTx(rawTxn)txn.sign(privateKey)const serializedTxn = txn.serialize()3. Transaction is validated locallyThe signed transaction is submitted to your local Ethereum node. You local node will then validate the signed transaction to make sure that it was really signed by this account address.4. Transaction is broadcast to the networkThe signed transaction is broadcast by your geth/parity node to it\u2019s peers who in turn broadcast to their peers and so on. Once the transaction is broadcast to the network, your local node also outputs the transaction id which you can use to track the status of your transaction. This transaction id is just the hash of the signed transaction object.transactionId = sha3(serializedTxn)If you execute the transaction on a public Ethereum network, the best way to track the status of your transaction is on etherscan.io. In the picture above, if you notice there are a couple of nodes marked as Etherscan nodes. The folks at Etherscan run a few nodes and they have a nice frontend webapp connected to it. When your transaction is picked up by their nodes, you can see your pending transaction on their website.One other thing to remember is, not all nodes will accept your transaction. Some of these nodes might have a setting to accept only transactions with certain minimum gas price. If you have set a gas price lower than that limit, that node will just ignore your transaction.5. Miner Node accepts the transactionAs you can see in the picture, the Ethereum network has a mix of miner nodes and the non miner nodes. As you probably know, the miners are the ones who do the job of including your transaction in the block. Miners maintain a transaction pool where your transaction gets added to before they start evaluating it.If you notice the picture above, the miners store all the transactions in the pool sorted by gas price. The higher the gas price, the more likely the transaction is included in the next block. This is the common configuration for a miner node (to optimize for higher pay). However, a miner can configure her node to sort the transactions however they like (say they want to help the network by mining only low gas transactions).In the picture above, you see how our voteForCandidate transaction is at the bottom of the miner\u2019s pool? Once all the high gas fee transactions have been mined and included in the block, the miners will work our transaction.One other thing to note is, the miner\u2019s pool can hold a finite number of transactions. Let\u2019s say there is a hot ICO sale going on or a really popular dapp (like Crypto Kitties) takes off . People submit their transactions with high gas price hoping that the miners pick up their transaction before any other transactions. If higher gas price transactions fill up the pool, your low price transaction is discarded. There is no hope for our candidate Nick to receive any vote for a while. We might even have to rebroadcast the transaction in such cases.Another trick to bump your transaction up the pool is to resubmit your transaction with a higher gas price but using the same nonce value. That way, when the new transaction is received by the miners, the new higher gas price transaction overwrites your old transaction. If the nonce value is different, it is considered a different transaction (You will end up casting 2 votes to Nick). Here is an excellent article from Jim McDonald explaining this topic in depth.6. Miner Node finds a valid block and broadcasts to the networkThe miner eventually picks our transaction to include in the block along with other transactions. The miner can only pick so many transactions to include in the block because Ethereum has set a block gas limit. i.e, the sum of all the gas limits on the transactions can not exceed the block gas limit. You can see the current gas limit at ethstats.net.Once the miners select the transactions to include in the block, the transactions are validated and included in a pending block and the Proof of Work begins. One of the miner nodes eventually finds a valid block (by solving the PoW puzzle) and adds that block to the blockchain. Just like the raw transaction was broadcast by your local node which was received by all other nodes, the miner node broadcasts this valid block to other nodes.7. Local Node receives/syncs the new blockEventually your local node will receive this new block and syncs it\u2019s local copy of the blockchain. Upon receiving the new block, the local node executes all the transactions in the block.If you use truffle to execute your transaction, truffle constantly polls the blockchain for confirmation. Once it sees the transaction is confirmed, it executes the code inside the then() block and prints the console log (per our example).2. Using Metamask instead of the local nodeIf you install the MetaMask browser plugin, you can manage your accounts in your browser. The keys are stored only on your browser, so you are the only one who has access to your account and the private key. When you execute a transaction in your browser, the plugin takes care of converting your function call in to a raw transaction and sign the transaction using your private key. Metamask runs their own nodes which they use to broadcast your transaction (Behind the scenes Metamask uses nodes hosted by Infura). This way, you don\u2019t even have to run your own Ethereum node.3. Offline signingWhat if you are not comfortable using a plugin or if you are worried that your local geth node might be compromised? There is a secure solution to solve that issue.If you notice, the first 2 steps don\u2019t require you to be online at all. If you want to absolutely make sure your transaction isn\u2019t tampered with, you can use a computer which is offline to convert the function call in to a raw transaction and use your private key to sign the transaction. You can then copy the signed transaction string and use a computer that is online to broadcast it to the network. There are many services like Etherscan and Infura you can use to broadcast your signed transaction to the network.Another safe solution is to use a hardware wallet such as Ledger or Trezor. These wallets store your private key and the code to sign the transaction is programmed in to the hardware itself. They need to be connected to the internet only to publish your signed transaction.Hopefully this gave you a better idea of how Ethereum transactions work. If you find something incorrect in the post, please leave a comment and I will fix it.Thanks Jim McDonald for proofreading this article.Self promotion: If you are interested in learning to build Ethereum dapps, check out my site zastrin.com!", "responses": 39, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Solidity", "Cryptography", "Development", "Decentralization"]}, {"title": "Ethereum ERC-20 Compatible Wallets", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@trexmarket/ethereum-erc-20-compatible-wallets-c352c9395bc?source=search_post", "author_name": "Trex", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@trexmarket", "publish_date": "2018-09-28", "last_modified_date": "2018-09-28", "readtime": "4.11", "claps": 6811, "voters": 388, "content": "Ethereum ERC-20 Compatible WalletsTrexFollowSep 28, 2018 \u00b7 5 min readWhat is ERC-20?Before discussing ERC-20 wallets, let\u2019s quickly discuss ERC-20. A token can generally represent any asset that has a value attached to it. In this case, we are talking about tokens which represent a smart contract and use of the Ethereum blockchain. There are several tokens native to the Ethereum blockchain. These tokens can be traded, bought or sold. ERC-20 is a token protocol for all tokens implemented by the Ethereum blockchain (Token protocol means rules or standards that the token must follow). All tokens which implement the protocol become a compliant token of ERC-20. The technical specification of this protocol comprises six functions that ensure that all tokens based on the Ethereum system work anywhere on the platform. Most cryptocurrency wallets that support Ether tokens support ERC-20 based tokens. There are a few native wallets for these token a well. Here are a few of the best wallets for ERC-20 compliant tokens.Hardware WalletsMost users prefer to use hardware wallets. A hardware wallet is the most secure storage unit for cryptocurrency. There are several expensive and inexpensive hardware wallets on the market. Here are a few which support the ERC-20 token:TrezorTrezor is one of the most popular hardware wallets and costs only $99 USD. It is a cold storage device meaning it is always offline. Trezor can be used for Ethereum and any ERC-20 affiliated tokens with the MyEtherWallet web interface. Trezor is a small, key-shaped device and connects to a computer through a USB cable. It requires a pin code to access the device but also has a recovery 24-word seed which is created offline in case of loss or theft. Trezor supports many other cryptocurrencies as well, so it can serve its purpose for multiple uses.Ledger Nano SLedger Nano S makes our list of ERC-20 wallets. The Ledger Nano S costs $98 USD. It looks like a USB device and similar to Trezor, requires a 4 digit pin for signing in every time it is plugged into a computer. Transactions are safe as they are physically verified on the embedded screen with the press of a button. Ledger also uses the MyEtherWallet web interface to access ERC-20 tokens. What makes this wallet extra secure is the fact that it supports a second-factor authentication \u2014 FIDO (Fast Identity Online), on websites and their subordinates (like Google, Google Dropbox). It also has a 24-word recovery seed which is created during setup.Mobile SupportWallets compatible with the iOS or Android platform are handy. They can be operated with ease and generally have a good GUI. There are significant worries over security issues, but good wallets are generally secure.TrustTrust makes ourmakes our list of ERC-20 wallets. Trust is open source and an official Ethereum wallet which supports all ERC-20 tokens. This application runs on both iOS and Android platforms. Private keys are stored locally and have multiple security layers. Trust has a partnership with Kyber Network. This allows for the instant purchase of coins on the exchange, and storage on the wallet. For those who prefer convenience and ease of access, this mobile wallet is for you.Other walletsMyEtherWalletMyEtherWallet is a web-based wallet. It is open source and allows for interaction with smart contracts. The GUI is user-friendly. The MyEtherWallet web interface is used to access and store ERC-20 tokens on Ledger Nano S and Trezor. As MyEtherWallet is essentially a hot wallet, it is best not to store large funds on it and make use of its compatibility with hardware wallets.ParityParity makes our list of ERC-20 wallets. Parity is a desktop wallet that has native support for ERC-20 affiliated tokens. The wallet will support the new ERC-223 protocol for Ethereum based tokens, and is quite popular among cryptocurrency enthusiasts. It allows registered users to access all the features of the Ethereum network, including dApps. This is possible through the Ethereum GUI browser. It is best not to store coins on a desktop wallet as a hacked computer can lead to a loss of funds.MetaMask (ERC-20 Wallet)MetaMask provides a convenient solution to store, manage and send ERC-20 tokens, as well as Ethereum coins. It serves as a browser to access the Ethereum and ERC-20 network. It is a plugin for Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox users and is quite secure. Users are not required to download the entire blockchain as native Ethereum nodes can communicate with external Ethereum nodes. MetaMask does not store the private keys of users on its servers. They are stored on Chrome or Firefox and are password protected. MetaMask is really easy to use and setup with the MyEther Wallet as well.", "responses": 5, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Ethereum Classic", "Ethereum Blockchain", "Ethereum Wallet", "Erc20"]}, {"title": "The Dai Stablecoin is a Game Changer for Ethereum and the Entire Cryptocurrency Ecosystem", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@james_3093/the-dai-stablecoin-is-a-game-changer-for-ethereum-and-the-entire-cryptocurrency-ecosystem-13fb412d1e75?source=search_post", "author_name": "James Seibel", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@james_3093", "publish_date": "2018-04-12", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-21", "readtime": "10.7", "claps": 5403, "voters": 507, "content": "The Dai Stablecoin is a Game Changer for Ethereum and the Entire Cryptocurrency EcosystemJames SeibelFollowApr 12, 2018 \u00b7 11 min readIn later December of 2017, the company Maker released their long-awaited system for a decentralized stablecoin named \u201cDai\u201d. Dai is an Ethereum ERC20 token that is pegged to $1 USD \u2014 every Dai is worth $1, and will always be worth $1, regardless of how much Dai is in existence. There is no centralized authority like Tether that backs its value, and no traditional bank that backs each Dai with a real US dollar. There is nothing that can be shut down, and no centralized authority that needs to be trusted. Dai lives entirely within the Ethereum blockchain using smart contracts.The way Dai accomplishes this without centralized trust is incredibly clever and interesting, and in this post I will try my best to explain why Dai can be trusted and why it\u2019s a game changer for cryptocurrencies.I won\u2019t say much about the Maker organization itself, except that it\u2019s one of the oldest Ethereum-focused companies and has been working on this project since before Ethereum existed. The team is very well-regarded in the space and is backed by Vitalik Buterin, the creator of Ethereum.NOTE: The author works for Airfox which created the AirToken. This post is unrelated to Airfox or AirToken.Why Dai is a Game ChangerBefore I explain the details of Dai and how it works, assume the following is true:Dai is always worth $1 USD eachIt can be freely traded like any other ERC20 tokenAnyone with an Ethereum wallet can own, accept, and transfer itIt can be exchanged without any middlemanNo individual person or company has control over itNo government or authority can shut it downThis enables several features that were previously impossible.USD (Dai) can now be transferred instantly, across borders, and without fees (other than ETH gas fees).Merchants can accept Dai with all the benefits of blockchain technology without the enormous risk of volatility. For example, merchants no longer need to worry about the price of Bitcoin fluctuating 15% between when they receive payment and convert into fiat currency. If a merchant charges $19.99 USD for a T-Shirt and receives 19.99 Dai, they can be confident that they have $19.99 USD whether they cash out their Dai that same day or in 2 months.Similarly, customers no longer have to worry about spending an asset that consistently goes up in value. A customer is unlikely to purchase a product with ETH if they think the value is going up \u2014 why spend $19.99 USD of ETH today when it will be worth $24.99 tomorrow? \u2014 but customers don\u2019t need to worry about price fluctuations when using Dai.The way most merchants currently accept cryptocurrencies as payment is to use a middleman like BitPay, which has all of the negatives associated with traditional payment processors. These include processing fees, limits, and rules on what industries they do business with. With middlemen like BitPay, merchants are simply offering another method of payment for their customers, but see no upside other than extra sales. Even worse, if BitPay decides they don\u2019t like you, they can shut you off without any warning for any reason.With Dai, a merchant can process payments directly, as if they were receiving cash. If they choose to use a third-party, it\u2019s only to provide value-added services like e-commerce integrations, accounting software, and wallet management. But there is no need for a third-party to process payments or temporarily hold funds \u2014 the blockchain itself can handle everything. No one can shut off the merchant\u2019s ability to receive payment.Finally, some may ask why you need something like Dai at all. Doesn\u2019t Tether already fulfill the purpose of a dollar-denominated token? My answer is that Tether, or any other centralized stablecoin, can be hacked, shutdown, steal your money, and is always operating at the whims of politics and human fallibility. Indeed, there is an enormous amount of speculation that Tether is operating fraudulently.Not-so with Dai. As a true decentralized stablecoin, you only need to trust the blockchain.How Dai WorksDai is a masterpiece of game theory that carefully balances economic incentives in the pursuit of one goal \u2014 a token that is continuously approaching the value of $1 USD.When Dai is worth above $1, mechanisms work to decrease the price. When Dai is worth below $1, mechanisms work to increase the price. The rational actors that take part in these mechanisms do so because they earn money anytime Dai is not perfectly worth $1. This is why Dai is always floating slightly above or below $1 \u2014 it is an endless wave function bouncing infinitely close to $1, but never quite achieving it. The farther Dai goes from $1, the more incentive there is to fix it. This is the magic of Dai.The rest of this article will explain precisely how these pricing mechanisms function as well as risks, safe guards, and actions that occur in response to events.What is Dai?Dai is simply a loan against Ethereum. Anyone can create Dai \u2014 all that\u2019s needed is ETH and the technical know-how to use a decentralized app (dApp).Most users \u2014 99.999+% \u2014 will never need to create Dai, nor understand how it\u2019s created. The longer Dai is worth $1 USD, the more faith users will have in it, and users will spend, accept, and convert Dai as needed.Even most cryptocurrency enthusiasts won\u2019t need to create Dai, nor understand how it\u2019s created. They will simply acquire Dai by trading for it on exchanges, including decentralized exchanges that live entirely on Ethereum, which makes Dai an essential component of any decentralized exchange.Dai is quite complex, and some have argued this complexity makes Dai too obtuse to ever catch on. This is a fallacy, as the primary use-case of Dai is being a stable $1 USD pegged token, which requires no deeper understanding of how Dai works. Again, 99.999+% of Dai users will never need to understand how Dai works.However, if you truly want to understand why you can trust Dai, you must understand all aspects of the Dai system and the economic incentives involved.We will now go down the rabbit hole.How is Dai Created?As I said, Dai is simply a loan against Ethereum. By using the MakerDAO dApp, advanced users can take loans out in Dai against their ETH holdings.First, ETH is turned into \u201cwrapped ETH\u201d (WETH), which is simply an ERC20 wrapping around ETH. This \u201ctokenizes\u201d ETH so it can be used like any other ERC20 token.Next, WETH is turned into \u201cpooled ETH\u201d (PETH), which means it joins a large pool of Ethereum that is the collateral for all Dai created.Once you have PETH, you can create a \u201ccollateralized debt position\u201d (CDP), which locks up your PETH and allows you to draw Dai against your collateral, which is PETH.As you draw out Dai, the ratio of debt in the CDP increases. There is a debt limit that sets a maximum amount of Dai you can draw against your CDP.Once you have Dai, you can spend or trade it freely like any other ERC20 token.Creating Dai is complex \u2014 why would anyone do this? Can\u2019t I just buy Dai on an exchange?Yes! Creating Dai is complex, and you can indeed buy Dai on exchange! This is one reason why 99.999+% of people will never go through the nonsense of creating a CDP.However, there are several important reasons why you would create Dai, despite the hassle:You need a loan, and have an asset (ETH) to use as collateral for your loanYou believe ETH is going up in value. You can use your CDP to buy ETH on margin \u2014 you lock up your ETH in a CDP, draw Dai against it, use the Dai to buy more ETH on an exchange, and then use that ETH to further increase the size of your CDP. This can be accomplished without any third-party or centralized authority allowing you to do so \u2014 margin trading can be accomplished entirely on the blockchain.The demand for Dai has driven the price above $1 USD. When this occurs, you can create Dai then immediately sell it on an exchange for greater than $1 USD. This is essentially free money, and is one of the mechanisms the Maker system uses to keep Dai pegged to $1 USD. Dai being worth over $1 USD encourages more Dai to be created.These three reasons are enough to ensure that Dai is continually created.How does Dai ensure that the value is always $1 USD?Economic incentives ensure that the value is maintained.As I said in the last section, when Dai is worth over $1 USD, ETH holders are incentivized to create more Dai and sell it, as it\u2019s free money.When Dai is worth less than $1 USD, CDP owners can pay down their debt at a cheaper price! This is an extremely clever solution that requires further explanation.Let\u2019s say I open a CDP with $1000 in ETH. I then draw out 500 Dai. In order to close this position, I must pay back 500 Dai (paying down debt destroys the Dai).If Dai is trading for less than $1 USD, say for $0.99, then I can buy Dai for less than $1 USD and then pay off my debt with a 1% discount. This is essentially free money \u2014if I took out a $500 loan (500 Dai), then bought 500 Dai for $495 (0.99 * 500 = 495, a 1% discount), then paid off my loan, I earned a free $5 of ETH.Of course, my demand for Dai increases its price, and eventually Dai increases in value until it approaches $1 USD. If Dai stays below $1, CDP owners continue to pay down debt and remove Dai from the system. When Dai goes above $1 USD, Dai is created to feed the demand. It is this push and pull, creation and destruction, supply and demand which ensures that Dai always matches the $1 USD peg.What if the ETH price crashes? Won\u2019t the whole system fail?The short answer is that provided ETH is worth something, and the value of ETH isn\u2019t extraordinarily volatile (i.e. dropping 60% of value in 10 seconds), the system successfully balances.The long answer requires more explanation.CDP\u2019s have varying degrees of debt. When you open a CDP, you can draw up to 60% of the value in Dai. This means that with $1000 of ETH, you can take out 600 Dai. But not every CDP takes the full amount \u2014 the more you draw, the riskier it is. Some CDP owners will withdraw 10%, 25%, 30%, etc.As ETH changes in price relative to USD, the debt ratio of each CDP also changes. As ETH rises in price, every CDP becomes safer as they are less indebted. As ETH falls in price, every CDP becomes riskier and more indebted.As each CDP has a different debt ratio, each CDP can be ranked in order of riskiness. More risky CDP\u2019s have higher debt ratios.As ETH falls in value, each CDP gets closer to the 60% debt threshold. If a CDP crosses this threshold, any Dai holder can pay off the CDP and earn a profit, which destroys Dai from the system, closes the CDP, and penalizes the owner of the CDP.This is complex and requires further reading to understand, but to summarize, rational actors are incentivized to remove risky debt from the Dai system by paying it off. CDP owners who let the debt get so risky are penalized for doing so, which incentivizes them not to have risky debt.CDP owners can make their debt safer by paying down debt as the CDP gets more risky. Astute CDP owners will observe their CDP getting more risky, then pay down Dai early to prevent a penalty. But those who neglect their CDP will get penalized by the system if they cross the debt threshold.As the value of ETH fell from $1,400 USD in January 2018 to $400 in April 2018, the Dai system\u2019s incentive structure successfully kept the value of Dai pegged to $1 USD, which is an incredible accomplishment and proof that Dai succeeds even in a falling ETH environment.How is the price of ETH known? I thought this system was decentralized?Extremely good question, and this is actually the riskiest part of the entire Maker system.The value of ETH to USD has to come from somewhere, and in the Maker system it comes from oracles. Multiple oracles provide pricing data, which reduces the risk that any one oracle is compromised. Additionally, the amount that the ETH to USD price can change per block is capped to prevent rapid changes caused by an attacker.But the final fail-safe is that Maker (MKR) token owners can vote a \u201cglobal settlement\u201d in the case of catastrophic failure, such as a coordinated attack. This shuts the system down and gracefully unwinds all positions to return ETH to the rightful CDP owners. This is the nuclear option in the system, and shows that MakerDAO is a true \u201cDecentralized Autonomous Organization\u201d (DAO). The owners of MKR itself are the ones who vote on what happens.What is the purpose of the Maker token? It doesn\u2019t seem like you need it to create or spend Dai\u2026The Maker (MKR) token has two distinct uses.The first is that owning MKR gives you the right to vote on the system itself. This is why Maker is a \u201cDecentralized Autonomous Organization\u201d (DAO) \u2014 MKR holders can vote on various things like maximum debt ratios. MKR holders can also shut down the whole system in the case of catastrophic failure, which is an essential fail-safe mechanism.The second is that paying down debt in a CDP requires the owner to pay a 1% annual fee for taking out the loan, payable only in MKR. For example, if you took a 500 Dai loan against $1000 of ETH and held it for a year, paying off the loan would take 500 Dai and $5 USD worth of MKR. The MKR used to pay off the loan is then destroyed (\u201cburned\u201d).The burning of MKR encourages the value of MKR to increase over time. As MKR is divisible up to 18 decimal places, as long as a single MKR token exists, up to $1 quadrillion USD could safely be traded without issue, and the number of decimals could be increased later if needed. So there is no issue that MKR will run out, and the amount destroyed will will decrease as the MKR value increases.Why is ETH the collateral? Why not another ERC20 token?ETH is the most important asset within the Ethereum blockchain, and it makes sense to use it as the first asset that backs CDP\u2019s.However, the Maker system will work regardless of the asset, provided it exists within Ethereum and oracles can provide a USD valuation. Maker has plans to use Digix as its next asset, which is a token backed by physical gold. Eventually multiple assets could be used to create a single CDP, including other ERC20 tokens.Why is Dai pegged to USD? Why not the Euro or Swiss Franc?The Maker system can work with any other currency or asset peg. In the future, similar stablecoins pegged to major currencies such as Swiss Francs, assets like gold, or even equity stocks can and will be created. All that\u2019s needed are pricing oracles.ConclusionThe proof that Dai works is that each Dai has been consistently worth $1 USD. As Dai continues to successfully maintain its USD peg, faith in Dai will increase.99.999+% of users do not need to understand how Dai works, they only need to trust it, and the history of Dai provides the trust needed. If you need to understand Dai deeper to feel comfortable using it, then you should carefully read and understand how it works, and plenty of additional information is easily accessible via Google.Dai is a game changer because it allows USD to be transferred in any amount, instantly, across borders, without fees, without any interference. This enables a new era of commerce that exists purely within the blockchain and cannot be shutdown.Maker is truly a technology that shows off the unique capabilities of Ethereum and provides a solution that was 100% impossible before blockchain technology.You will hearing much more about Maker and Dai \u2014 this is only the beginning.", "responses": 13, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Ethereum", "ICO", "Technology", "Economics"]}, {"title": "Designing the architecture for your Ethereum application", "post_link": "https://medium.com/zeppelin-blog/designing-the-architecture-for-your-ethereum-application-9cec086f8317?source=search_post", "author_name": "Santiago Palladino", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@spalladino", "publish_date": "2017-11-21", "last_modified_date": "2019-02-13", "readtime": "9.69", "claps": 3043, "voters": 510, "content": "Designing the architecture for your Ethereum applicationSantiago PalladinoFollowNov 21, 2017 \u00b7 10 min readAs you are beginning with Ethereum development, and after going through some of the many excellent tutorial posts out there, you are faced with the challenge of building your first Ethereum-based app.This brings up a set of new challenges around designing the architecture and layout of your application: traditional client-server applications now have a third new component in the mix, the blockchain.In this article I\u2019ll cover some of the most traditional scenarios for Ethereum applications, which arise from the different interactions between these three components. I\u2019ll discuss serverless apps, browser plugins, private nodes, offline signing, and other issues that play a role when designing the layout of your solutions.Client-blockchain in serverless appsThe canonical flavour of an Ethereum app is a serverless one, where the entire flow of your app happens entirely between the client and the blockchain.The first step here is to actually distribute the client code to your users. The easiest way is to set up a static page that contains a web3-enabled web app. Such page can be hosted anywhere: AWS S3, Google Cloud, Github pages, other cloud providers, or your own server. Furthermore, if you can count on your clients having either bzz or ipfs protocol support, you can even disitribute it via Swarm or IPFS for total decentralization.Querying the blockchainNext step is for the app to be able to read information from the blockchain, which, as you already know, requires a connection to an active Ethereum node. This will be set by your web3 provider, which is the piece that handles the actual web3 connection to a node.Now, some of your users may already have an established connection to a node, for instance, via the official Mist client, or through a browser plugin like the very popular Metamask, which acts like a lightweight client to the blockchain. Their FAQ even provides a code snippet on how to detect if it is available on a client, and use it as a provider for web3.What to do then for those users who don\u2019t have Mist or Metamask? If you only need them to query the blockchain without actually sending any transactions, you can establish a connection to a public Ethereum node. This should be a geth or parity node open to the public, but without exposing the personal API for managing accounts, and without any unlocked accounts. Such a node will only act as a gateway for querying constant contract functions. And if you don\u2019t want to host it yourself, the great folks at Infura offer public nodes at no cost.This way, users with a running Ethereum infrastructure can use their connections to their own trusted nodes, and less tech-savvy users can use the public nodes. This implies that the latter users are choosing to trust the information provided the third-party controlled node, for the sake of ease-of-use.Sending transactionsQuerying the blockchain is easy, but what if you want your users to submit transactions and actually perform state-changing actions on smart contracts?For those of your users who have Mist or Metamask installed, the problem is instantly solved, for both of them provide a way for managing the user accounts and requesting the user to approve a transaction at the application\u2019s request. Mist will provide a gateway to the user\u2019s local node and its accounts for signing transactions, while Metamask will sign transactions client-side and relay them to the Metamask public nodes.From Developing Ethereum Dapps with Truffle and MetaMask.As for the rest of your users, if you don\u2019t require them to install Metamask or use Mist to use your app, you\u2019ll need to direct them to manually send the transactions to interact with your application, from whichever wallet they work with.Most applications implement this by asking the user to send a certain amount of ETH to an address, optionally including a QR or a copy-to-clipboard button.Shapeshift Ethereum exchange dialog.Your client-side application may then monitor the contract events to update the user interface as the transaction sent out-of-band is executed. Since watching events is simply a way of querying the blockchain, it can easily be done through a public node.Now, for executing contract functions, you may need to request the user to send ETH along with additional data to execute a specific function. You can use the request method of a contract function to easily obtain the data needed for running a method, and present that to the user along with the target address.SimpleToken.at(tokenAddress).transfer.request(\"0xbcfb5e3482a3edee72e101be9387626d2a7e994a\", 1e18).params[0].data// returns data for invoking transfer with args => '0xa9059cbb00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000de0b6b3a7640000'Personally, I am not a big fan of this pattern, for it requires a fairly complex interaction from the user. Not all users are aware of how additional data works in Ethereum, much less how to send it along in a transaction.If you do need to implement it, make sure that your contract\u2019s fallback function rejects all payments or has a reasonable default behaviour, so if the user forgets to include the additional data when manually sending the transaction, he does not lose the funds sent.Note that, in many scenarios, a cleverly designed fallback function may actually always execute the expected behaviour for the user sending a transaction. This way, your smart contracts just react to users sending funds, and run different functions depending on the current state, without requiring the user to set any additional data.Another trick is to add proxy contracts, where each of them execute a particular function in your main contract upon receiving Ether. As a simple example, let\u2019s say you are implementing a binary voting application: you have your main contract with a vote-yes and a vote-no function. Rather than asking the user to include the yes-or-no flag in their transaction, you can deploy two additional contracts, with no logic except for calling vote-yes or vote-no in the main contract on behalf of the message sender upon receiving any transaction. Needless to say, this approach only works in rather simple apps, but can often help reduce complexity for users who do not have Ethereum-aware software in their browsers.Implementing your own walletAnother option for having your users perform complex interactions with your smart contracts is to actually bundle wallet management into your application. As a first step for a user, the application can create a new account for them, which will be used to send any transactions directly from your code.Coral Fundraiser asks for a password for the newly generated account, which is downloaded encrypted to the user\u2019s computer, so he can later access it in another session or even a different wallet.The user will then need to seed this account with some Ether, either from a different account or directly from an exchange service; consider dropping in a Shapeshift integration here for ease-of-use. Once the account has the required balance to pay for transaction fees, the client-side code may execute any needed operations on behalf of the user through a simple click.Behind the scenes, your application will use the private key of the generated account to sign any transactions client-side, and then relay them to a public node for execution.This pattern involves heavy coding, for you need to add the features of generating and encrypting, as well as importing, an ethereum account (you may want to take a look at the ethereum-wallet library for implementations of these tasks). Furthermore, all transactions need to be crafted and signed manually, and then sent as raw transaction to a node. It also requires more involvement from the user, who is tasked in setting up a new account, and having the responsibility of safekeeping the account file.Nevertheless, once set up, your user can perform Ethereum transactions directly from your application with zero friction at all, and without needing to install any software at all.All in all, which approach you use will depend heavily on the kind of users you are reaching out to, as well as the kind of interaction you expect they will have with your application, whether it is continuous usage, or infrequent or one-time accesses.Server-to-blockchainNow, let\u2019s add a server into the mix, and leave the client aside for this section. As such, the following may apply not just to app servers, but also to standalone apps, scripts, or batch processes.Setting up a local nodeThe first solution is the vanilla one: set up a local Ethereum node and use its JSON RPC interface from your application to perform all your blockchain operations.You may also want to keep an unlocked account for running transactions from your application (the unlock flag for both Geth and Parity may come in handy here). Just make sure the JSON RPC interface of the node is not accessible from anywhere but your application, otherwise anyone may access your node and steal your funds. As an additional precaution, keep the funds on the unlocked account to a minimum, and seed it from a different source as needed.Offline signing and public nodesAnother solution, similar to one explored in the previous section, is to have your app sign transactions offline, and relay them to a public node. This article explores how to set up a web3 provider engine in your Truffle configuration to transparently sign transactions offline and send them to an Infura node.If you go down this route, keep in mind that you are blindingly trusting the public node you are connecting to: albeit it cannot modify the transactions you send to it, it can choose to not relay them to the network, or to provide fake responses to your queries. This could be mitigated by connecting to multiple nodes simultaneously, and sending the same transactions or queries to all of them; but this makes your codebase much more complex.Tying it all togetherAfter going through different ways of setting up client-blockchain and server-blockchain queries and transactions, it\u2019s time to discuss how to orchestrate everything together.Coordinating client and serverHaving both client and server interacting simultaneously with the blockchain implies that you may need to coordinate both of them. For instance, you may want to have the server react to an action performed on-chain by a client, or visualize in a client certain state-changes on a contract.The canonical way for observing changes on a contract, from both client and server, is to listen for contract events. Design your events carefully, to ensure all relevant actions have an associated event, and use indexed arguments so observers can filter only the events relevant to them. Typically, a client will only listen for events that affect them directly, while servers may monitor all the contracts related to the app.You may also directly monitor specific transactions if they are issued directly from your application code, in order to check that they are successful.Clients may also post to the server the id of a transaction they issued as a proof of an action executed on-chain, rather than having the server listen for events. However, keep in mind that a malicious actor may be monitoring transactions on-chain, and could push to the server a transaction id from a different client, pretending it belonged to him. Make sure to use client-to-server messages only as notifications, and not as sources of truth.Regardless of relying on monitoring transactions or events, ensure to only react upon them after a reasonable number of confirmations. Even if you have a transaction mined, it could still be subject to a chain reorganisation, and eventually run in a different context, potentially becoming invalid. Wait for about a dozen blocks (more in testnets) before acting upon an on-chain event, though consider letting your end-user know that the transaction was successful yet is unconfirmed, so as not to keep them in the dark.Server responsibilitiesNow, a critical question that you need to answer is why do you need a server at all. In traditional client-server apps, the server acts as a permanent storage, enforces bussiness logic, and coordinates clients; all tasks that can now be performed on-chain.Nonetheless, there are still many uses for a server backing your app. First and foremost, on-chain code cannot directly work with off-chain services. This means that if you want to integrate with third party services, inject external data like USD/ETH rates, or perform basic actions such as sending an email, you need a server to take care of this.The server can also act as as cache or indexing engine for your smart contracts. While the ultimate source of truth is the blockchain, your clients may rely on the server for search capabilities, and validate the returned data on-chain.Large data storage is prohibitively expensive today on Ethereum, due to the gas costs incurred in using contract storage. As such, your application may also rely on a server for storing large blobs of data, while only a hash is kept on-chain for verification. The same happens with complex computations, which may exceed the Ethereum block gas limit, and thus need to be run in separate infrastructure.It\u2019s worth mentioning that more and more projects are appearing around the EVM that provide seamless integration with these services. Some examples are Filecoin or Storj for storage, Truebit for computation, or Oraclize for oracles. Eventually, servers may become thinner and thinner until they disappear into a myriad of side-chain services and integrations. Maybe, a few years from now, this post will be obsolete and our blockchain applications will be running in an absolutely decentralized fashion.Be part of the communityContinue the discussion on our forumJoin our Telegram groupFollow us on TwitterEven better, join the team \ud83d\ude80", "responses": 8, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Smart Contracts", "Architecture", "Guide"]}, {"title": "Understand why Ethereum exists, and you\u2019ll get why it\u2019s a big deal", "post_link": "https://medium.com/mit-technology-review/understand-why-ethereum-exists-and-youll-get-why-it-s-a-big-deal-df6765a5805d?source=search_post", "author_name": "MIT Technology Review", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@MITTechReview", "publish_date": "2017-10-27", "last_modified_date": "2018-08-25", "readtime": "1.98", "claps": 2626, "voters": 509, "content": "Understand why Ethereum exists, and you\u2019ll get why it\u2019s a big dealThe world\u2019s second-most-valuable cryptocurrency is also its most interesting \u2014 but in order to understand it, you must first understand its origins.MIT Technology ReviewFollowOct 27, 2017 \u00b7 2 min readFounder of Ethereum Vitalik Buterin during TechCrunch Disrupt London 2015 \u2014 Day 2 at Copper Box Arena on December 8, 2015 in London, England \u2014 John Phillips/Getty Images for TechCrunchBy Mike Orcutt", "responses": 8, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Cryptocurrency", "Ethereum", "Technology", "Money"]}, {"title": "Introducing PAYTHER\u200a\u2014 A Decentralized multipurpose payment ecosystem & management tool on ethereum blockchain.", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@payther.foundation/introducing-payther-a-decentralized-multipurpose-payment-ecosystem-management-tool-on-ethereum-8cce193bc218?source=search_post", "author_name": "Payther Foundation", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@payther.foundation", "publish_date": "2018-06-08", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-21", "readtime": "8.54", "claps": 6657, "voters": 378, "content": "Introducing PAYTHER\u200a\u2014 A Decentralized multipurpose payment ecosystem & management tool on ethereum blockchain.Payther FoundationFollowJun 8, 2018 \u00b7 9 min readOne of the most disturbing issue among blockchain users is their hunt for a most convenient way of transacting over the internet with assurance of no risk of fraud and theft, while still having their transactions anonymously.Ethereum and bitcoin has worked towards achieving this lifelong goal and have proved to be the best and by far most reliable means of sending payment which can\u2019t be altered or erased. But this only lies with bitcoin as being only created as an alternative source for making payment and a means of storing value, but ethereum is more than that on the plain.While Both digital currency received a lot of praise for the way it allows for payments without worry\u00a0about foreign fees and currency exchange rates, they still lack some basic useful feature which will truly enhance daily transaction experience of their respective users.Transaction costs continue to rise. In some cases, they are on par with credit card payment processing fees. Additionally, transaction times are getting longer. The limited size of the blocks contributes to the longer times and that has some users frustrated, due to different reasons like the long waiting time to wait for payments to settle.There come the PAYTHER IDEAPAYTHER, a decentralized smart wallet developed with a simple concept of enhancing digital payments over the ethereum blockchain using an advance elliptic curve.The project is solely based on aiding peer-to-peer payment by providing useful facilities such as escrowed transaction, batch payments, transaction scheduling, e.t.c. to mention the few which traditional ethereum wallets doesn\u2019t provide to ether users, speaking of escrow technology +\u00a0the power of smart contract.PAYTHER, a portmanteau of payment + ether, will run dependently on the ethereum blockchain as a multipurpose tool for securing and managing user funds, without users needing to entrust their personal wallet info to third parties including payther servers itself. This\u00a0platform\u00a0will\u00a0be\u00a0fueled\u00a0by\u00a0it\u2019s\u00a0own embedded\u00a0token\u200a\u2014\u200apaythers\u00a0(PYT).the innovative feature of the PAYTHER smart walletPAYTHER has a lot of uses which an average ethereum or in nutshell, a cryptocurrency user will find very handy and useful, applicable to their day-to-day online transactions. Payther aims to be the PayPal of cryptocurrency, but smarter and more secure. Here are all of the amazing and handy feature the PAYTHER project is aiming to develop in the near coming months;Multiple payments\u200a\u2014\u200aits not a common trait and feature of most traditional ethereum wallet to facilitate multi transaction feature. Payther will be the first among numerous platform to offer a simple and convenient way for users to mark several payments to numerous recipients up to 10000 at the same time at no additional cost, while still maintaining the erc-20 standard and decentralized nature of the ethereum network. This is so easy as just providing all recipient ethereum address and specifying the amount for each address or simply send an equal amount of funds to all at once. We believe this should provide ease to users who are planning a large payment disbursement or running an airdrop of their custom erc-20 token.Payment scheduling\u200a\u2014\u200aone of the most prioritize goal of this project is creating a really smart and stress-free payment ecosystem for all ethereum users. With this feature, one can appoint his funds to be sent to a specific user and at a specific time and date, either one-time or recurring. This process is handled by an underlying smart contract and a web3 API which connects to an ethereum node, ensuring all interactions are between the end user and the ethereum network. A real use case for this feature is when a user needs to participate in an auction, ICO or an event where its strictly based on entry time whereas the user may not be fully available to participate manually.Task-payment exchange\u200a\u2014\u200aPAYTHER will not only provide way for making decentralized payments across ethereum blockchain but will also provide an innovative facility where anyone can exchange tasks and payment mutually. This feature aims at eradicating trust issue between task conductors and participants using an inbuilt proof-of-task algorithm to ensures tasks are performed by participants before a payment can be released to participating parties. This works on a proven concept where user A will create a task such as downloading music, content sharing or social media promotion, and sends it was a specific payment of choice to user B through email and ethereum address, and authorizing the smart contract to withhold the payment. user B will be notified of the pending payment and instruct to complete the attached task, where upon completion, the PAYTHER smart contract will be triggered by the PAYTHER platform AI API, and the funds will be immediately deposited to the address specified by user A or user B in case of no address provided by user A.Decentralized p2p escrow \u2014 a well-secured smart contract powered escrow between users within the ecosystem to safely exchange any supported erc-20 token with one another. Any one can directly exchange tokens by sending a transaction notification to the second party email, which after it\u2019s accepted, the initiator will be alerted, and funds of the intend amount will be locked until the final transaction has taken place. This will only involve the sender, the smart contract, and the end recipient. A clear brief explanation of how this works is; user A needs to exchange his Token X for token Y with user B, but this deal needs trust implements. Both party can use PAYTHER to complete this transaction regardless of the trust reputation between both party, by imitating the PAYTHER escrow. User A will need to retrieve user B email address and his erc20 address, input them on the platform and send the transaction. Token X will be locked temporarily by the smart contract. User B on the other end will be notified by email of the incoming escrowed transaction and will accept it. He (user B) will be taken to a payment page where he\u2019ll send token Y to a specified ethereum address as provided by user A, and upon confirming the transaction on the ethereum network, the smart contract will release token X to user B.Payther user name domain\u200a\u2014\u200aOne of the innovative aim of PAYTHER is the development of a simulated Ethereum Name Service (SENS) which works almost similarly as ENS, but without going through tedious process of obtaining one and only works within the PAYTHER ecosystem. The PAYTHER SENS domain name allow any one turning their 0xUSERADDRESS address into something easy to remember such as payther.me/Amazinguser through domain-to-address mapping and further makes it possible to conduct a donation event, where a unique interface will be displayed to recipient to donate or contribute in any digital currency (ETH & PTY for now) as set by the sender/owner, where all the funds received through this SENS address will be automatically forwarded to the sender\u2019s underlying ethereum (mapped) address in real-time. The SENS will be most useful for users who tend to have something more unique when requesting payment from other within the PAYTHER ecosystem and in future, ETHEREUM network in general.Off-chain payment gateway & on-chain payment settlement for merchant\u200a\u2014\u200aPayther will also provide a facility to enable ecommerce; online stores and businesses, to easily accept and track ethereum/payther payments using our simple integrated API. We would like to extend ethereum to far more people in the world in respective to their choice of usage be it for every day use or for business purposes.Implementation of the ecosystem utility token\u200a\u2014\u200aPYT tokensTo ensue long term stability and optimal performance of the platform, we created a token which will serve as the fuel that power the usability of the ecosystem.The\u00a0Payther Token\u00a0(PYT) is the necessary currency to exploit the PAYTHER services, most especially the decentralized task-payment exchange feature\u00a0which\u00a0basicly\u00a0works\u00a0with\u00a0Payther tokens\u00a0only. Without the Payther token it won\u2019t be possible to exchange cryptocurrencies using the escrow or be able to mark several payments in a single go on the app platform, since the commissions will be paid solely with the Payther token. The Payther token utilized in the services will be\u00a0used to\u00a0fund\u00a0the\u00a0operational\u00a0cost\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0project\u00a0and\u00a0as\u00a0incentives\u00a0to\u00a0developers\u00a0contributing\u00a0the\u00a0the\u00a0growth\u00a0of\u00a0Payther. The total amount of PAYTHER tokens that will ever exist is capped at 1 billion,\u00a0no\u00a0more,\u00a0no\u00a0less.No tokensale or crowdsalePAYTHER is an open source and non-profit oriented project meant to provide value added feature that enhance how funds are managed and how payments are being made over the ethereum network. The PYT token is but an utility token meant to be used as the fuel for obtaining some features of the PAYTHER ecosystem. Therefore, we are not organizing any public crowdsale or initial token offering. The PYT tokens will be distributed through series of airdrops and community bounties. Details regarding this will be available on the website soon, and official announcement will be made on all our official pages.Project development plansThis team behind this project mainly consist of cryptocurrency enthusiasts and researchers who ultimately devoted their time and focus on how they can improve cryptocurrency usability and finding ways it can suit the everyday needs of men in this ultramodern age. At first, the funds required to start the project was budget in some amount of eth, but as the market continues to crash, it almost halve these funds, and though that\u2019s really a threat, we still have some of our early partners providing much support as much as they could. however, a tree does not form a forest, so we have decided to partner with as many potential investors and Cryptocurrency experts. As the users and their results of using our platform will eventually determine the success of our platform, we have decided to focus on gathering potential users at an early stage. We are in contact with several investors who are interested in supporting the development of the platform so the Payther platform will definitely be developed, launched and accessible to everyone!To build a potential userbase and to introduce our Payther token we will launch one of the biggest airdrop ever by distributing 300 million tokens to 300,000 lucky registrants. That will primarily mean every participant will be entitled to 1000 PYT Tokens. To pull this off we will need the help of all our supporters!A public donation/fundraising programme will be organized to allow the public and all our willing supporters to donate to the development funding which will see the project come through. We will provide full details about the airdrop and the donation event in the next coming days.Building the community around PAYTHERCrowds and community are the backbones and pillar of a successful project.

FOR REAL.With great powers come great responsibilities. I\u2019m not responsible for you not being cautious with your ETH, or using these powers for the evil side of force (for Vitalik\u2019s sake, don\u2019t do that). I truly hope you do good and feel empowered by the potential that this technology puts in the hands of people.THIS CONTRACT HAS NOT BEEN AUDITED. It means that it is experimental code, has not been verified and can be broken, if you intend to do a REAL ICO, you HAVE to Audit the code and do a proper contract tailored to your specs.I have absolutely no responsibility for you, your dog, your money, or your life. Be big boys and girls and own it.Before we start:There are a few different components you will need in order to build your own token.Ethereum Address (Ropsten Network)Some Ethereum (Ropsten Network)A text editor (I.e.

We will use the Ropsten Test network. In order to get started, go to MyEtherWallet (MEW) and create an account there.To get setup, click the right hand side corner, change the network to Ropsten (MyEtherWallet) \u2192 click the New Wallet \u2192Enter a password you can remember \u2192 Download / Save your Keystore file in a safe space \u2192 Save your Private Key in a safe space.To view your wallet address, go to \u2192View Wallet Info \u2192Private Key \u2192 Enter the saved private key \u2192Unlock your Wallet and it should be there!Text EditorDownload one of the following text editors:Sublime TextAtomContractDownload the smart contract that the legendary Ethereum unicorn rider, BokkyPooBah has helped us to make, by clicking here. \u2b05\ufe0fYou will be editing this code for your own ICO Contract.Ropsten Ethers [UPDATED]We have created our own faucet where you can request Ropsten Ethereum! Just access https://faucet.bitfwd.xyz/ and put your ropsten address and our smart contract will send you some!Transfer only once please! And if it doesn\u2019t work let me know in the comments!\ud83d\udea8Many faucets in the ecosystem are going through some problems due overload in requests. The best way to get Ropsten in the bitfwd one doesn\u2019t work is using Metamask! That one is always full.Basically what you will have to do in simple terms:Download MetaMask at metamask.io.Select Ropsten Network.Select DEPOSIT.Claim 1 Ropsten ETH.Transact to the address you will use for the tutorial on MyCrypto.Now let\u2019s get started:Open the contract you downloaded in your Text Editor.Go to Line 3\u201315 and look at the comment section. Although this is a comment section, this will help you down the track. The name of the template ICO is \u2018bitfwd\u2019 CROWDSALE token contractChange Line 4 to the title of your crowdsale.You will just change Line 6 after you deploy the contract on the Blockchain.Change Line 7\u2019s Symbol to your respective coin name (Keep it short)Change Line 8 to the name of your tokenNext:Go to Line 102 and change \u201cbitfwd\u201d to \u201c(YourCrowdsaleName). DON\u2019T USE SPACE OR IT WON\u2019T WORK.Do the same for Line 118Go to Line 119 and change the symbol name, the same as the ones you did in the comment sectionDo the same for Line 120Leave Decimals at 18.On line 122 you will have to define you first ICO parameter, when does the bonus ends?And on line 123, you will define when does the Crowdsale ends.Alright, we are almost done editing the contract code.Now, go to line 212. On that comment, write what is the amount of your tokens you will be giving away for ETH.On line 218, define how much people will get within the BONUS.On line 220, define how much people will get without the BONUS (the same ratio that you put on line 212).The \u201cmsg.value\u201d is the amount of ETH that someone sent. So taking my contract as example, for every 1 ETH, i would give 1000 FWD in return.Boom! The contract is done. Yes, it was that easy right? Now we are going to do some fun stuff, so bare with me until the end!Go to http://remix.ethereum.org/In the browser/ballot.sol, paste the code you just edited! If something red comes up, there is something wrong in the code. If there are any yellow warnings it\u2019s alright, let\u2019s hope for the best.Remix EditorNow Under Compile\u2192Choose the Token you are creating \u2192DetailsOn ByteCode press the \ud83d\udccbbutton to copy the ByteCode to your clipboard.Now, you will paste it into code editor. DON\u2019T FREAK OUT. There will be a lot of stuff there. The one and only thing we want is the BYTECODE (a huge chunk of numbers and letters) from the object. What you will see will be like: \u201cobject\u201d: \u201cBYTECODE\u201d, .Add 0x to the beginning of the BYTECODE, like: \u201cobject\u201d: \u201c0xBYTECODE\u201d,. And copy it to another file on the text editor.The object BYTECODE with 0x added at the beginningNow, go to MEW where we will start to deploy the contract.

To do that:In the Overview Tab \u2192 Click on the Contract AddressGo to the Contract Code Tab \u2192 Click Verify and PublishNearly there\u2026 The following steps are really important. So pay attention. Basically what we are doing here is trying to guarantee that the code fits what you saying you are deploying and registering this on the network. FOREVER.So if you commit mistakes, it will be wrong forever. What a good friend once told me is that on the Blockchain:Get it right once or get it wrong forever.Now you have 5 things to do on this page.Be sure that the contract address field corresponds to the contract address that you have just deployed. Remember contract address is different to the MEW address you created so make sure not to get them confusedThe contract name has to match the one in the code, in my case is this: bitfwdToken. This was on Line 102 in your codeTo check which version of the complier, go back to the remix page where you got the BYTECODE from and look at the URL, the complier version will be there. In most cases it should be: v0.4.19+commit.c4cbbb05.jsOn Optimisation, choose No (We haven\u2019t enable it before).On ENTER THE SOLIDITY CONTRACT CODE BELOW, copy the whole code from Remix, and paste in that area. NOT THE BYTECODE, but the code itself. Can also be copied from your text editor.*Remember to add on line 6 the contract address that has been generated!Now, leave the other fields in blank and click on Verify and Publish.But be aware\u2026 This is the moment that you were waiting for\u2026 It is about to happen!FINGERS CROSSED AGAIN FOR VITALIK\u2019S SAKE. \ud83e\udd1eThe last challenge.The moment of truth\u2026Success!!!If a success page come along with green checkmarks and stuff, you did it!

Can data help us better understand this evolving market?Sarah PanFollowJun 28, 2017 \u00b7 9 min readUpdate: Thank you everyone for making this #1 on Hacker News!Read the HN discussion here.Lately it seems like money has been growing on trees.With trade volumes reaching billions of dollars a day and market caps hitting tens of billions of dollars, it\u2019s no wonder that cryptocurrencies fuel the gold rush of the modern day.We live in the age of digital currencies, with cryptocurrencies birthed within the decade. Yet already, there are more than a thousand cryptocurrencies in the market and an initial coin offering (ICO) almost daily.As we embrace this new, proliferous market, it\u2019s important that we try to understand what\u2019s going on. There are many risks to observe at both the micro-level (e.g., personal investments) and macro-level (e.g., prevention of market crashes and major loss of capital). That\u2019s where we come in.We\u2019re data people. Specifically, we\u2019re the developers of TimescaleDB, a new open source time-series database built up from PostgreSQL. And we thought it would be insightful (and fun) to analyze the cryptocurrency market using PostgreSQL and TimescaleDB (plus R for data visualization).For this analysis*, we looked at historical OHLCV price data on over 1200 cryptocurrencies (as of 6/26/2017; courtesy of CryptoCompare). While our current dataset represents only a daily record of rates, TimescaleDB scales easily to much finer-grained historical data. With the constant influx of new coins and exchanges, TimescaleDB can provide a reliable foundation for time-series data in the cryptocurrency market.Here\u2019s what you should take away from this post:Several high-level insights into the cryptocurrency marketA better understanding of how TimescaleDB + PostgreSQL make time-series data analysis easierInstructions on how to load this dataset yourself and draw your own insights (and perhaps find your own arbitrage opportunities!)*Please note that nothing in this analysis should be construed as financial advice. If you\u2019d like to draw your own conclusions, here are instructions to install TimescaleDB and download this cryptocurrency dataset.So if you had invested $100 in Bitcoin 7 years ago, it would be worth\u2026Let\u2019s start with some good old-fashioned FOMO. If you know anything about cryptocurrencies, you\u2019ve probably heard of Bitcoin, the \u201cgranddaddy\u201d of all cryptocurrencies. Turns out that if you had invested $100 in Bitcoin in July 2010, it would be worth over $5,000,000 today.Bitcoin has had a pretty nice run since then (although taking a small dip recently):BTC closing price in USD over the last seven yearsUsing PostgreSQL, we\u2019ve queried BTC\u2019s prices at 2-week intervals, analyzing the rates for USD exchanges. (Note that \u201ctime_bucket\u201d and \u201clast\u201d in this query are special TimescaleDB time-series data analysis functions not in PostgreSQL.)But hopefully you didn\u2019t buy in February 2014\u2026It hasn\u2019t exactly been a smooth ride for BTC. Let\u2019s hone in on the day-by-day volatility of BTC. Here we calculate daily returns using the power of PostgreSQL window functions:BTC daily return (as a factor of the previous day\u2019s rate) over the last seven yearsAs a relatively new market, bitcoin prices are notably subject to volatile fluctuations. While a steady increase in price marks the success of BTC, the highest spike occurred in early 2014. If we zoom in on 2014, we notice that the jump occurred specifically between February and March of 2014. For those who invested at the peak of this market, the price soon stabilized, forcing investors who bought then to hold for a long time to see returns.BTC daily return (as a factor of the previous day\u2019s rate) over 2014Goodbye China, hello JapanThe cryptocurrency market is global. When looking at trade volumes by currency, we noticed something interesting:Volume of BTC in different fiat currencies over the last seven years (in 14 day intervals, stacked)The year 2014 saw a minor jump for Bitcoin rates in China, presumably caused by the devaluation of the yuan and weakening domestic stock market. This was followed by a subsequent boom in 2016 and early 2017, as Chinese volume dominated Bitcoin trades.Volume of BTC in CNY over the last year (in 14 day intervals)Within a few months, the volumes dropped dramatically.Why? This is where we had to step out of the numbers and do some old-fashioned research. (And what we found shows how you can\u2019t just rely on quantitative data when trying to understand this market.)In early 2017 the People\u2019s Bank of China began reinforcing regulations and legal liabilities for risky cryptocurrency exchanges. By February, two of the largest Chinese exchanges (OKCoin and Huobi.com) had suspended withdrawals and by mid-2017, Chinese transactions had dried up. From there, Japan became the leader in bitcoin transactions by volume, even going so far as to recognizing bitcoin as legal currency in April 2017.Volume of BTC in all currencies after BTC/CNY dropped in 2017. BTC/JPY is now volume leader. (In 14 day intervals, stacked).Now, if you had invested $100 in ETH in January 2017\u2026.Don\u2019t worry if you didn\u2019t hop onto the Bitcoin train in 2010. As volatile as Bitcoin has been, some would argue that Ethereum has been a crazier ride (and the recent \u201ccorrection\u201d shows it). Let\u2019s look at the Ethereum price over time in Bitcoin (as it\u2019s normally quoted):Last closing price of ETH in BTC over the last three yearsBut as we know, Bitcoin itself has been fairly volatile, which renders the above chart less useful. So let\u2019s look at ETH prices in fiat currencies, using each day\u2019s BTC to fiat exchange rates. (Taking advantage of Postgres JOINs and some fancy filters):Last closing price of ETH in three different fiat currencies over the last three yearsIn its first year, ETH surpassed any yearly BTC growth rate in all of BTC history \u2014 a hefty 530% surge in average closing price from the previous year marked a good start. Cumulatively, the growth has since fallen to 200% going from 2016 to 2017, though still an impressively high rate for any other asset. And within the last half year, ETH prices have increased by 3000%. So, if you had invested $100 in ETH in January 2017 (less than 7 months ago), it would be worth over $3,000 today.Projecting the price of ETH in these stable currencies (USD, EUR, CNY), it appears that the trend lines remain consistent between the three fiat monies. A clear progression is apparent in the steep uprise within the last six months and trends reflect a massive growth for the coin when quoted in all currencies, except BTC. Relative to the fiat charts, the ETH/BTC chart is quite unstable due to the fluctuating price of BTC over the years. As a result, the representation of ETH by BTC price inflates the variability of ETH. Clearly BTC is still too immature to be considered a base currency.What about the 1200 other cryptocurrencies??With that brief examination of BTC and ETH trends, hopefully you have more context into the hectic world of cryptocurrencies. So what do we do with the other 1200 cryptocurrencies?Well first, let\u2019s use our dataset to trace the lineage of these cryptocurrencies:(Disclaimer: our dataset represents when we first have recorded data, which may not necessarily correspond to the ICO.)Date of first record for each cryptocurrency (listed by descending date)It\u2019s an evolving market. And one with no clear ceiling, as we can see when we query the number of new cryptocurrencies by day. Above are just the most recent 20 records, showing how many new currencies amass each week.Here\u2019s a look at that same day, but counting the number of new currencies with data each day:Number of new cryptocurrencies in the dataset, by day, over the last four yearsNumber of new cryptocurrencies in the dataset, by day, in 2017Number of new cryptocurrencies in the dataset, by day (listed by descending date)When we query each of the currencies by their first set of data (to track its \u201cage\u201d), it\u2019s clear that the market is not simply for investors, but also for creators of these digital assets. Most recently, a flood of new coins entered our dataset during May 25\u201328, amounting to over 300 new cryptocurrency records in less than a week. (Of course, these dates reflect when our data source first had price data for the currencies, which may not correspond to the ICO.)Who\u2019s at the head of the cryptocurrency long tail?There are so many cryptocurrencies that it becomes hard to separate the good ones from the noise. How do we identify which ones worth focusing on? Here\u2019s one metric: total trade volume over the past week.Total transaction volume in USD for top 10 currencies over the past week (ranked by volume)Total transaction volume in USD for top 10 currencies over the past week (ranked by volume)Quick note on what this query is doing: The BTC and crypto-currency data lives in separate tables. So we have to UNION the two queries. Also, as we established earlier, we want to quote volumes in a fiat currency (e.g., USD) and not BTC. So the second half of the query joins with the BTC table to convert BTC to USD.Top cryptocurrencies (measuring by transaction volume) are (not surprisingly) Bitcoin and Ethereum. But after that, seems like Litecoin (LTC), Ripple (XRP), and Ethereum Classic (ETC) are not far off. As a five-year old coin, Litecoin is almost identical to Bitcoin and is often considered a key player in the market. Meanwhile, Ripple targets a more specific audience as a banking coin in the global commerce arena, also showing promise as a progressively dominant coin. Interestingly in the top 5 for our query, both ETH and ETC make appearances, suggesting a major shift towards Ethereum in the market.What are the most profitable cryptocurrencies?Another way to sift through the long tail of cryptocurrencies is by profitability (e.g., as measured by total daily return). Our data contains a set of prices for over 1200 cryptocurrencies. If we hone in on the highest increase in rate by day, we can see which cryptocurrencies lead the daily market.Highest daily return and corresponding cryptocurrency (listed by descending date)Here we identify the cryptocurrency with the highest total daily return, by day, going backwards in time. (To do that, we again use a window function to calculate daily returns, and then use the TimescaleDB last function to find the cryptocurrency with the highest return for that day.)Our output for the last three months shows a numeric lead by AMIS (168x on 6/15), which appears as the cryptocurrency with the top increase for 15 distinct days. However, if we look more closely at AMIS\u2019 rates, we realize that this high increase is also due to high fluctuation rates: AMIS tends to drop back to a closing price of zero after each increase.Closing price of AMIS over the last yearLikewise, the cryptocurrency YOVI appears 3 times in our list of daily leads but has a similarly unreliable trend like AMIS:Closing price of YOVI over the last yearWhile both trends are rather unstable, they show more promise than ETH\u2019s down-sloping first year (2015):Closing price of ETH in 2015(Repeat Disclaimer: TimescaleDB does not endorse any of these cryptocurrencies and is not liable for investments that you make / losses you may incur.)So money grows on\u2026 Merkle Trees?Here we drew some conclusions from public cryptocurrency datasets, highlighting the power of both PostgreSQL and TimescaleDB. Yet we should remember that the cryptocurrency market will inevitably be different next month, week, even day.But if you\u2019d like to explore this dataset and draw your own conclusions, here are the instructions for downloading it (and installing TimescaleDB).If you\u2019d like to learn more about TimescaleDB, and how it makes PostgreSQL scalable for time-series data, we\u2019d recommend this technical post.Thanks for reading our post!

Sending transactions requires fees, and using ethereum to run smart-contract code is comparatively costly to other kinds of computation.The idea behind state channels is that we can make blockchains more efficient by moving many processes off-chain, while still retaining a blockchain\u2019s characteristic trustworthiness. Despite their conceptual simplicity as a natural extension of the \u201cpayment channel\u201d concept, this technique today remains heavily under-utilized and underdeveloped.This is why we are excited to share that we have started working on a generalized state channels implementation with a focus on privacy, speed, trust minimization, security, and modularity. We think this is one of the most important layers of infrastructure that needs to be built today.We will not be doing an ICO, token sale, or other kind of fundraising event involving a token. As has been pointed out by Fred Ehrsam, Elad Gil, Vitalik Buterin, and many others, the economic incentives for core protocol innovation and second-layer infrastructure are much too low, and so the token model of funding a project in these domains has unfortunately become overused. Instead, we will initially be funded by a donation from Vitalik Buterin.In our view, state channels are the basic foundation for usability in distributed applications. They reduce latency from the unacceptably high levels of today\u2019s blockchain applications to the weblike response times that users expect.Even with other scalability methods like sharding, many applications that rely on large numbers of individual operations (such as streaming payments, IoT devices, games, etc) cannot hope to achieve the cost reductions they require without the added savings that state channels are able to introduce.Rather than receiving the benefit of these savings across a wide number of different applications, today\u2019s blockchain application users will be lucky to find a one-off single-purpose state channel design that runs on its own network, isolated from other applications.These different applications may use the same types of assets, yet deploy separate and highly bespoke contracts that cannot interoperate. They must be audited for security concerns on an individual and ongoing basis; significantly increasing costs. They are rarely optimized to the theoretical limits, often consuming orders of magnitude more gas than is necessary, and frequently going to chain when doing so is not even strictly required.The state of the art advances slowly, and developers are often left struggling to solve the same problems over and over, where one mistake threatens the entire security model of the application. Even when secure, these custom implementations have significant privacy drawbacks; leaking detailed information about the network graph, participant assets and activity.We envision a different future.We want to see clearly designed general purpose state channels that do not reduce, and in fact in many cases greatly increase, privacy.We don\u2019t want to put anything on the chain that doesn\u2019t need to be.We want channels that can be easily incorporated into new applications without the requirement for those developers to also be state channel experts.We want to achieve a level of privacy where state channel operations are indistinguishable from other common types of on-chain activities.We want to see support for multiple parallel operations inside of a single channel that do not interfere with each other.We want to provide expertly optimized, formally verified, and highly audited components that developers of decentralized applications can rely on without repeatedly re-inventing the wheel.We want to support deploying or upgrading channel designs without requiring the user to make a single on-chain operation.And we want to establish clear standards for how all of these generalized state channels will fit together into a global, multi-blockchain network where any user can easily connect to any other.Together, we are working towards building this future.We will be making further announcements around our plans for this project soon. For now, we are entirely focused on building a working prototype using our approach and speaking to developers and founders of decentralized application projects. We intend on building the best possible interface for decentralized application developers to work with so they can deliver the web-like experience their users expect without compromising on any component of the decentralized internet.If you\u2019re interested in working with us or want to support the project, please send us an email.", "responses": 9, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Ethereum", "State Channels", "ICO", "Decentralized Apps"]}, {"title": "", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/because-of-ethereums-exponentially-growing-blocksize-the-bottleneck-is-not-regulated-8c0acd77b3a2?source=search_post", "author_name": "Vitalik Buterin", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin", "publish_date": "2018-05-24", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-21", "readtime": "1.30", "claps": 6409, "voters": 396, "content": "The Ethereum-blockchain size has exceeded 1TB, and yes, it\u2019s an issue17.1K72StopAndDecryptVitalik ButerinFollowMay 24, 2018 \u00b7 2 min read>Because of Ethereum\u2019s exponentially growing blocksize, the bottleneck is not regulated> At some point your node will fall out of sync because of this or a blocksize cap will be put in place.This is *severely* uninformed.

So we *already are* experiencing the worst of it and have been for half a year.Also, focusing on archive node size is highly fallacious because (i) you can have a much lower datadir size by either resyncing even once per year, or just running a Parity node, which prunes for you, and (ii) it includes a bunch of extraneous data (technically, all historical states, plus Patricia tree nodes) that could be recalculated from the blockchain (under 50 GB) anyway, so you\u2019re not even \u201cthrowing away history\u201d in any significant information-theoretic sense by doing so.

I\u2019ve been thinking more about the potential impact it could have on the world.What is Toshi today?Toshi is sometimes difficult to explain because it is a combination of three different things.Steve Jobs introduces the iPhone as three things combined.A Dapp BrowserToshi is a way to use decentralized apps built on the Ethereum network. Early dapps (like CryptoKitties and Leeroy) have started to gain traction in 2017, and I would expect many more in 2018, with increasingly good usability. Our first goal with Toshi is to be the best dapp browser on mobile and web.A mobile Ethereum walletThere hasn\u2019t been an easy way to store and spend your own Ethereum on mobile to date. Toshi changes that, enabling p2p payments, commerce, and a way to store your Ethereum tokens securely. This can happen via QR codes (similar to WeChat) or sending to other users.An identity and reputation systemWith an identity and associated reputation for each user, we\u2019ve introduced a trust layer into the ethereum ecosystem. This system will eventually be moved to a decentralized system (uPort seems to be the most promising) but the technology still has a ways to go. Having a trust layer feels like a critical component to eliminate bad actors, get loans (replacement for credit reporting agencies), etc.If I had to pick one word to describe Toshi it would be a \u201cdapp browser\u201d. Similar to how \u201csmart phone\u201d came to mean many things, \u201cdapp browser\u201d may come to mean a combination of the above items.Toshi and dapp browsers are continuing to evolve quickly. We are in the primordial soup phase of this product.What can Toshi be in the future?What we\u2019re really testing with Toshi is the idea that people anywhere in the world can lift themselves out of poverty if they\u2019re given some basic tools.Those tools are:Private property rightsAccess to sound moneyAbility to get a jobAbility to get an educationAbility to get a loanOur theory is that the smartphone + ethereum + dapps offer an unprecedented opportunity to bring this to people all over the world. We\u2019re attempting to increase the economic freedom of the world, and clean up some bad behavior in the lowest scoring countries.It can be easy to take the above tools for granted if you\u2019ve only ever lived in developed countries. But for the majority of people living in the world today, those tools are inaccessible.Imagine someone using Toshi in the future having the following experience:A user receives their first Ethereum from a friend, charity, or job. They write down a 12 word phrase that only they know. They now have access to their own wealth which cannot be taken from them (i.e. property rights).Ideally over time, the value of that wealth will go up (not down due to inflation etc). These first two steps alone are something that many people in the world have never experienced. Allowing people who create wealth to keep it, is probably a necessary (if not sufficient) condition for economic growth.They start to to complete small tasks within in the app (answering questions, labeling photos, translating text) to earn small sums. They now have a small way to earn money (a job) even if it is menial to start. With the ability to earn money legitimately, people may be less inclined to turn to crime or more desperate options. Providing opportunity can reduce crime.They are incentivized (via small payouts from a private charity) to complete some online classes, perhaps watching a Khan Academy video and taking a short test to demonstrate retention. With education and credentialing attached to their profile, their employability (for higher paying jobs) increases.With this new found surety, they decide it is time to launch their own business. They are able to obtain a loan via a dapp on the platform with the reputation they\u2019ve accumulated over time. Their business begins employing others in their community, creating a positive feedback loop toward economic growth in that region.Toshi has a long ways to go to reach the above vision, and let me emphasize again that this is just a theory we are testing. But it gives us an aspiration to shoot for in the coming years.CharityWe\u2019ve also been very inspired by charities like GiveDirectly.org who are making small unconditional payments to poor families. Imagine how many more countries could be reached with a global mobile money solution powered by digital currency.The dapps in 2018 may look more like derivatives of CryptoKitties, but my hope is that the decentralized web grows to become much more powerful. And we\u2019re doing our part to invent that future.If you haven\u2019t tried Toshi you can install it here to start browsing the decentralized web.If you\u2019re an engineer or designer interesting in joining us on this mission, please apply to join here.", "responses": 14, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Ethereum", "Tech", "Startup", "Cryptocurrency"]}, {"title": "Amazon AWS now offers Blockchain and Ethereum is a Winner", "post_link": "https://medium.com/futuresin/amazon-aws-now-offers-blockchain-and-ethereum-is-a-winner-3d289a6c20e4?source=search_post", "author_name": "Michael K.

AWS Blockchain Templates for Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric.The AWS blockchain template provides a quick and easy way to use source frameworks to build and deploy secure blockchain networks. Blockchain is a technology that makes it possible to create an application in which multiple parties can record transactions without the need for a trusted central authority to ensure that the transaction is verified and secure. The blockchain can achieve this goal by establishing a peer-to-peer network, and each participant in the network can access the common ledger that records the transaction. These transactions are artificially designed, immutable, and independently verifiable. (AWS Blockchain Templates).Given the recent increase in regulation around cryptocurrencies and ICOs, this provides a more legitimate tool for developers to develop peer-to-peer and decentralized solutions, as well as new consensus based distributed ledgers that could impact a broad range of industries. Blockchain itself is increasingly in the news being adapted by major firms in how they improve trust in their ecosystems.Amazon a Winner in Blockchain ImplementationThese templates will let you launch an Ethereum (either public or private) or Hyperledger Fabric (private) network in a matter of minutes and with just a few clicks.While Facebook was the first major platform to ban Crypto related Ads, it has also been rumored to look into how to monetize cryptocurrencies within its own platform.

And you are there, not knowing what exactly to do and how everything works together.If this is the first article that you read on Ethereum or the blockchain eco-system in general, you are going to love it! Experts calling each others names on twitter, unsafe standards and protocols, untested and buggy development tools. Not everything is figured out yet, everyone is going in different directions, and there still a lot to be done. The future of institutions, banks, and governments is being decided by mad developers! It\u2019s so great.Anyway, don\u2019t worry anymore, I\u2019ll try to connect all the dots for you in this tutorial series, and walk you through the universe of Smart contracts and dapps developement, and show you how everything fits together.While I will not get into every detail, I\u2019ll link some materials that will help you understand some concepts better, and it\u2019s up to you to research them and get into all the little details. The goal of this series is to help you understand better how things work together, in the simplest way possible, like a friend would explain it to you.I don\u2019t even know what Ethereum isThe official website of Ethereum tells us this:Ethereum is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts: applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third-party interference.In other words, it uses the capabilities that gives us the blockchain technology to certify the execution of the code that we run.If you don\u2019t know what the blockchain, Ethereum, Bitcoin, cryptocurrency or any of these words mean, I advise you to listen to this excellent podcast by Tim Ferriss, interviewing Nick Szabo and Naval Ravikant: The Quiet Master of Cryptocurrency \u2014 Nick SzaboWhat are Smart Contracts?On Ethereum, Smart Contracts are scripts that can handle money. It\u2019s as simple as that.These contracts are enforced and certified by parties that we call miners. Miners are multiple computers who add a transaction (Execution of a smart contract, payment of a cryptocurrency etc.) to a public ledger that we call a block. Multiple blocks constitute a blockchain.We pay these miners with something called Gas, which is the cost to run a contract. When you publish a smart contract, or execute a function of a smart contract, or transfer money to another account, you pay some ether that gets converted into gas.If it\u2019s still unclear, or you want to know more details, here are some interesting links:A different introduction to Smart Contracts in video.Smart contracts page on Wikipedia.A more detailed explanation of Gas.Before diving into smart contracts developmentIn this tutorial, I\u2019ll assume that you already have some basis in software development, and have a basic knowledge of Javascript and Node.JS. Otherwise, you\u2019ll be quickly lost. Solidity, the programming language that we will use to develop, is close to Javascript\u2019s syntax, and since a lot of development tools around Ethereum are based on Javascript and NodeJS, it will be easier for you to get in if you are already comfortable with both. This is not a tutorial for beginners, and while I\u2019ll link some alternative tutorials for you if you didn\u2019t understand some concepts, it\u2019s up to you to research the rest.Smart contracts developmentNow, finally, we start the interesting part, as I said Solidity is close to Javascript, but they are not alike. On Solidity, and I\u2019m sorry to tell you that, frontend developer, you just can\u2019t slap JQuery on a piece of code and hope that it will work, you can\u2019t overlook security, and you just can\u2019t hack your way through. We will see why when we will discuss security, development patterns, and fail-proofing our code.Now, for our first example, I\u2019m thinking about a script inspired by the movie In Time, where, in a dystopian future, people trade their remaining time to live like money. In the movie, they have a variant of arm wrestling that involves playing with that time, and we will do just that! Wrestling money using a Smart Contract.And don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll make available for you all the scripts we will see on Github.Also, if it\u2019s the first time you deal with smart contracts, it\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t understand everything now, it takes practice, reading the docs, and a bit of research to get accustomed to Solidity.The codeNow, onto the coding, first of all, the base of a Solidity script is the following snippet, the pragma directive to tell the compiler which version of Solidity we are using, and the name of our contract, a similar structure to a class in Javascript. Here it\u2019s \u201cWrestling\u201d.We want two wrestlers, so we will add two variables that hold the address of their accounts (Public keys of their wallets).In our little game, in each round, the wrestlers will be able to put in a sum of money, and if one put in double the money of the other(in total), he will win.One important thing about the public/private keywords is, even though, a variable is private, it doesn\u2019t mean that someone couldn\u2019t read its content, it just means that it can be accessed only inside the contract, but in reality, since the whole blockchain is stored on a lot of computers, the information that is stored inside the variable could always be seen by others, and that represents the first security consideration that you should keep in mind.On the other hand, the compiler automatically creates getter functions for public variables. To make it possible for other contracts or users to change the value of the public variable, you need to create a setter function.Now we will add three events, for every step of our game. The beginning, when the wrestlers register, during the game, for each round, and at the end, when a wrestler wins. Events are simply logs, and they can be used to call JavaScript callbacks in the user interface of distributed applications, also known as dapps. Events can even be used for debugging purposes during development since there is no equivalent to the \u201cconsole.log()\u201d function of JavaScript on Solidity.Now we will add the constructor, in Solidity, it has the same name as our contract and it will be called only once, upon the creation of the contract.Here, the first wrestler will be the one who created the contract. \u201cmsg.sender\u201d is the address of the one who invoked the function.Next we let another wrestler register with the following function:The require function is a special error-handling function within Solidity that will revert changes if a condition is not met. In our example, if the variable wrestler2 equals the 0x0 address (the equivalent of 0 for addresses), we can proceed, if the address wrestler2 is different from the 0x0 address, it means that a player has already registered as an opponent, and therefore, we will refuse new registrations.Again, \u201cmsg.sender\u201d is the address of the account that called the function, and we emit an event that signals the start of the wrestling.Now, every wrestler will call a function, \u201cwrestle()\u201d, putting in money. And if both have played, we see if one of them has won (our rule was that one of them have to put in double the cash of the other one). The \u201cpayable\u201d keyword means that the function can receive money, if it isn\u2019t set, the function will not accept ether. The \u201cmsg.value\u201d is the amount of ether that was sent to the contract.We then add the endOfGame(), and endOfRound() functions. The \u201cinternal\u201d keyword is the same as private, the only difference is that internal functions could be inherited by other contracts(since Solidity is similar to other object-oriented languages), while private functions cannot be inherited.Notice that we don\u2019t deliver the money to the winner directly, while in this case it\u2019s not that important, since the winner will take all the money off this contract, in other cases, when multiple users can withdraw ether off a contract, it\u2019s more secure to use a withdraw pattern, to avoid re-entrancy.It simply means, that if for example multiple users can withdraw money off a contract, one can simply call the withdraw function multiple times at once and get payed multiple times. So we need to write our withdraw function in such a manner that it will nullify the amount he should receive before proceeding to pay him.It looks like this:And that\u2019s it.

It is praised by some as the new internet or the world\u2019s computer and criticised by others as a platform that enables widespread scams and ponzi schemes to thrive. I see badly informed articles about Ethereum, smart contracts, DApps, DAO\u2019s, ICO\u2019s and tokens on the daily so it is time to analyse the subject. I will present the argument that Ethereum might form the main protocol enabling the \u2018internet of value\u2019.It is time to take a closer look at what Ethereum is, what it enables and what role it could play in the future. But first, we have to backtrack a bit. Time for a small reminder about the value of distributed ledger technologies.Decentralized and \u2018trustless\u2019To put it briefly, a blockchain is a database that is secured and maintained by a large number of nodes worldwide. Data is stored in blocks, which are time-stamped and linked to each other to form a chain. The blockchain makes sure that all data stored in the chain is secure and immutable forever, which is what makes the blockchain so interesting. Through its consensus mechanism, the blockchain is \u2018trustless\u2019, which means that one does not have to rely on the trustworthiness of a counterparty.It\u2019s trustless, so what?For the first time, the blockchain enabled a safe way to send value on the internet without needing a trusted third party. This led to the rise of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.In essence, a Bitcoin transaction is just the execution of a piece of code stating that \u2018person A\u2019 sent X amount of Bitcoin to \u2018person B\u2019. This transaction is self-enforcing. To execute, it first checks if there is enough Bitcoin in person A\u2019s digital wallet and then sends the money to B\u2019s wallet. In itself, this transaction is a piece of code that automatically executes if a certain variable is met. It is a digital contract. This (smart) contract was the first application of a piece of code that could be fully trusted to (a) act in the way it was designed and (b) be immutable, without the need of a controlling authority.Computer code however, can be used to do much more than this.Vitalik Buterin realized early on that if a cryptocurrency could potentially disrupt traditional finance by eliminating the need for trusted third parties, then smart contracts can disrupt many more industries in which intermediaries are needed to provide trust. He started playing around with Bitcoin\u2019s coding (scripting) language, but found that it was not flexible enough for the amount of applications he imagined. As such, he created Ethereum.EthereumEthereum is a programmable blockchain. Like any blockchain, Ethereum is based on a peer-to-peer network protocol consisting of many computers worldwide. Instead of providing users the ability to use a few pre-defined operations (e.g. bitcoin transactions), Ethereum allows its users to run pretty much any code they want. The code is stored on the blockchain for others to interact with and is often referred to as smart contracts.The computers (nodes) in Bitcoin\u2019s network maintain and update the blockchain. In Ethereum, they also run the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The Ethereum Virtual Machine is a supercomputer that combines of all computing power of the nodes in the network combined. This computing power is used to run the user-submitted code (smart contracts) on the blockchain. To execute these, the EVM charges a very small transaction fee in exchange for the computational power used by the smart contract. This fee is called \u2018gas\u2019 and it is paid in Ether, which is why Ether should not really be seen as a cryptocurrency, but rather as the the oil to run the network.Ethereum is a supercomputer, which lets users run pretty much any code they want.Smart ContractsAs mentioned, Ethereum allows people to deploy smart contracts on the blockchain. A smart contract is a self-executing piece of code, which defines and executes agreements between multiple parties. The idea of \u2018smart contracts\u2019 was first conceived by Nick Szabo in 1994. He reasoned that code is perfectly able to define a series of relations, parameters and actions.In Ethereum, smart contracts can be written in Solidity, an Ethereum specific programming language. These smart contracts can then be uploaded to the blockchain and will continue existing there. Because the blockchain is secure and immutable, one can fully trust that a smart contract on Ethereum will execute like intended. Self execution results in that counterparty risks and moral hazards are essentially eliminated from the equation, as the contract enforces its own provisions.Vitalik Buterin explains smart contracts as following in Ethereum\u2019s white paper:\u201cContracts in Ethereum should not be seen as something that should be \u201cfulfilled\u201d or \u201ccomplied with\u201d; rather, they are more like \u201cautonomous agents\u201d that live inside of the Ethereum execution environment (EVM), always executing a specific piece of code when \u201cpoked\u201d by a message or transaction, and having direct control over their own ether balance and their own key/value store to keep track of persistent variables.\u201dSmart contracts can be used for a wide variety of different transactions. They are very suitable for simple transactions, in which obligations of both parties can be boiled down to easily verifiable set of requirements. Think for example of financial products (such as derivatives, futures, options etc.), simple consumer transactions, Internet of Things data exchange or automatic payments of musicians or content creators per minute of \u2018use\u2019 of their intellectual property.As a further example, I could write a smart contract that acts as an insurance against drought for farmers. The basic parameters would be as follows:if, sensors from KNMI (Royal Dutch Meteorological Institute) indicate that less than 6 mm of rain has fallen in the past 3 months; andif, user has deposited a monthly insurance premium defined in the contractthen, send amount X money to user.In my example, the KNMI sensors act as an \u2018oracle\u2019 to get trustworthy up-to-date information for the contract to execute. An oracle is a trusted third-party, sensor or blockchain that can provide information needed for the contract.Illustration 1: Farmer Insurance visualisedDecentralized ApplicationsNow, let\u2019s say that, instead of just one insurance product, I want to start a whole insurance company on the blockchain. We\u2019ll call it BlockSurance. Firstly, I would want more than one product, and would code more than one smart contract. The different contracts would be coded for a variety of products and functions.That smart contracts on Ethereum can interact with each other, is very helpful for BlockSurance. After a very dry year, I would not want the \u2018farmer-drought insurance\u2019 contract to run out of funds to compensate the farmers. As such, I could make my different insurance products (smart contracts) send the insurance premiums to one central smart contract that would act as the general reserve. If the farmer-drought insurance contract concludes that a farmer is entitled to X amount, a message will be sent to the general reserve contract to pay the farmer X amount, which will then automatically execute.BlockSurance\u2019s smart contracts are stored and executed on Ethereum\u2019s blockchain, which means they are \u2018trustless\u2019: my customers don\u2019t have to trust me to know that they will receive a payout when they are entitled to one, as the contracts execute themselves. My customers are also ensured that these contracts cannot be hacked or changed because the blockchain is immutable. There is no counterparty risk as long as the code in the contracts is audited by the Ethereum community to confirm that they will work as intended/advertised.Of course, BlockSurance is going to need customers \u2014 and I want their user experience to be as easy as possible. So, I will set up a website and create a great user interface. This website will be the front-end of my application, while Ethereum\u2019s blockchain and my smart contracts are the back-end.If I have done all of the above, I have essentially created a decentralized application, or DApp. However, A DApp is increasingly understood to not only be an application running on a blockchain, but also to have its own cryptographic token.TokensSo what is a token?A token is a new sort of digital property, the value of which is determined by supply and demand. A token grants a set of rights to its owner, in relation to the decentralized application it was created for. A token can for example be used for governance of the project, distribution of equity rights or access to the decentralized application it was created for. The widely varying characteristics of a token makes its legal nature a very interesting topic to examine.For BlockSurance, let\u2019s imagine I create a token as well. This cryptographic token could for example be used for access to the DApp: to use my insurance, one would have to pay the insurance premium with the token.Moreover, if the insurance turns out to make more profit than needed, I could have my token holders vote on what should be done with this profit. I could do so by setting a threshold in my general reserve contract, which, once every year, if crossed, allows token holders to vote for:a profit distribution among token holdersa reduction of the insurance premiuman increase of insurance payoutsthe deployment of funds to developersFor every voting option I just deploy a smart contract which allows users to send tokens to it during the voting period and returns them afterwards. The contracts communicate with each other at the end of the period to see which received the most votes. Whichever contract received the most will automatically execute.To make a my own cryptographic token, I used to be required to make my own blockchain. Building a whole blockchain is a time-consuming process as I would have to design its protocol, consensus mechanism and set up nodes. If I don\u2019t have enough nodes it could easily be subject to a sibyl or a 51% attack. As a hypothetical developer, I don\u2019t want to have to worry about security or designing a whole blockchain.Ethereum solved this problem by not only allowing the deployment of smart contracts, but also the creation of tokens on top of its blockchain. But how these tokens distributed?Initial Coin OfferingsTokens are often distributed for the first time through an Initial Coin Offering, or ICO. In an ICO, investors and potential users of the platform can buy tokens by exchanging them for Bitcoin or Ethereum. It is a form of crowdfunding which lets developers raise money while early adopters and opportunistic investors speculate on the future value of the project\u2019s tokens. The ICO is also known also known as a token distribution. This year, more than $2.2 billion has been raised with an ICO so far.By doing an ICO for BlockSurance, I can raise money to hire developers to improve the front and back-end of my decentralized application. The ICO also gives my insurance company a ton of exposure and helps kick start my business. Optionally, I could also put a part of the funds collected in the \u2018general reserve contract\u2019 or pay back my seed investors. I am also going to pocket a part of the tokens for myself, resulting in a distribution like this.Illustration 2: Distribution of tokensMost ICO distributions look something like this. Of course, the exact percentages can vary, but almost always developers give themselves a share of the tokens. The funds raised from ICO investors go towards the actual development of the project.Decentralized Autonomous OrganisationsA Decentralized Autonomous Organisation (DAO) is an organisation that is completely governed and managed by the rules encoded in its underlying bundle of smart contracts. A DAO is essentially a DApp in which the developers do not play a special role anymore once it is launched. The difference between a DApp and a DAO is one of governance and autonomy. A DApp\u2019s source code and future road map is governed by a group of developers or an organisation, while a DAO is truly autonomous. What the organisation does and what it will do is all previously determined in its code. In fact, the code is the organisation itself.In other words, in a DAO, the future development (if any) is fully determined by in-built governance mechanisms that let tokens holders vote for the deployment of the raised funds. Voters could for example vote for the DAO to invest in other projects. Another option is allowing any developer to submit proposals for changes or additions to the DAO, which can then be voted on. If successful, a developer will get permission to implement his proposal and get paid from the raised funds. For this to work, the smart contracts to allow for such voting-based implementations have to be built-in the DAO from day one.At the time of writing there are 266 DApps & DAO\u2019s. Most of these are deployed on Ethereum. Some notable examples are:Dapps:Augur \u2014 A prediction marketGolem \u2014 A market place for idle computing powerBasic Attention Token \u2014 A digital advertising exchange and browser with an \u2018attention-based\u2019 revenue model for content creatorsStatus: A decentralized browser, messenger with in-built access to DAppsDAO\u2019s:The DAO: A crowd-sourced investment fund (also known as the biggest failure in the short history of smart contracts)MakerDAO: A DAO that aims to minimize price volatility of its own tokenDigixDAO: A marketplace that allows for trade in a gold-backed token on the blockchainUse cases and the \u2018internet of value\u2019What Bitcoin did was allow individuals to exchange cash without involving any middlemen, like banks, payment processors or the government. For Bitcoin\u2019s use case, the trust these institutions provide is not necessary.Ethereum\u2019s impact may be more far-reaching. As almost anything can be coded and secured on its blockchain, other intermediary actors that provide trust could potentially be replaced. Depending on how much value you believe these intermediaries bring aside from trust, these actors could include notaries, bankers, the insurance sectors, real estate agencies, online marketplaces for goods and services like Uber and Ebay etc. The argument goes that almost anything of value for which intermediaries are necessary to provide trust can be done more efficiently on the blockchain.Although this argument has its flaws, it is clear that blockchain technologies empower individuals from around the world to deal with each other by eliminating counterparty risk from the equation. Inevitably, this means that, to some extend, trusted intermediaries lose their importance in our economic system. We will see a shift away from these parties towards peer-to-peer services and the sharing economy. A shift away from a centralized economy to a distributed one.The internet distributed information in a manner that was not conceivable before the rise of the technology. The blockchain allows for the trustless exchange of value over the internet, pushing us to challenge how we have structured society, defined value and rewarded participation. This is why blockchain technology is referred to as the driving force behind the \u2018internet of value\u2019 or the Internet 3.0. Ethereum is already the biggest protocol that allows the creation of smart contract, DAO\u2019s and DApps, and many believe it might just become the backbone of this new internet.The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance and permissioned chainsThe Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) is a network for academics, companies and startups to share knowledge and \u2018to define enterprise-grade software capable of handling the most complex, highly demanding applications at the speed of business\u2019. This network is quite extensive, with notable members such as JP Morgan, Microsoft, Master Card, Intel, Deloitte and BP. Considering the possible use cases for blockchain technology, it is logical that a wide variety of companies want to experiment with their own implementations to increase efficiency within their respective sectors.Illustration 3: non-exhaustive visualisation of Enterprise Ethereum Alliance MembersIt is often argued that the EEA is a driving factor in Ethereum\u2019s valuation, but this is not (or better said, should not) be the case. The companies are experimenting with the deployment of private (for use within one company) and consortium chains (in which multiple parties with existing relations can benefit from having a shared ledger for a specific use case). These \u2018permissioned\u2019 blockchains are private \u2018forks\u2019 or private versions of Ethereum. A private fork of Ethereum allows companies to restrict user access to certain parties. The nodes to secure the network are supplied by the companies involved. Because there is few parties to the network, there is more flexibility in changing the rules of the blockchain, reverting transactions, modifying balances etc. There are also less transaction costs (because there are less nodes) and common risks in public blockchains such as 51% attacks are not possible, as all validators are known.On a personal note, I would like to add that I believe most people overestimate the potential of permissionless chains and underestimate the potential of permissioned chains. I am not questioning the efficiencies that well-structured blockchains can bring to many sectors. However, as said before, permissioned chains are more efficient than their permissionless counterparts due to the differences in the difficulty of reaching consensus. I am not saying that transparency, censorship resistance and security are not great in and of itself, but for a decentralized project to succeed, much more is needed than just those attributes (think user experience, competitive costs etc.).ConclusionBlockchains give the potential to provide efficient, fast, secure, reliable and auditable transacting of value. Like the internet before it, the blockchain promises to upend business models and disrupt industries. Blockchain technologies are pushing us to challenge how we have structured society, defined value and rewarded participation. This is why some refer to blockchains as the enabling technology for the internet 3.0, or the internet of value.As almost anything can be coded and deployed on Ethereum\u2019s blockchain, Ethereum might just form the base of this new internet. However, high potential comes hand in hand with hype, and talk of the internet 3.0 brings problems resembling the ones surrounding the dot-com crisis.Edit: This piece has focused solely on the positive aspects of Ethereum. There is however, a lot of valid criticism on the project.

Here we examine at a high level, the constituents of a transaction and explain how most of the gibberish hex values are determined.We will be using nodejs in this tutorial so we start off by installing the dependencies.$ npm install web3@0.19 ethereumjs-util@4.4 ethereumjs-tx@1.3Then creating a file tx.js and requiring the dependencies.var Web3 = require('web3');var web3 = new Web3(new Web3.providers.HttpProvider('https://ropsten.infura.io/'));var util = require('ethereumjs-util');var tx = require('ethereumjs-tx');First we start with a private key. Ethereum uses public key cryptography for authentication. More specifically, Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) with secp256k1\u2019s curve is used. The private key is just a random 256 bit data except for some restrictions. For examplevar privateKey = '0xc0dec0dec0dec0dec0dec0dec0dec0dec0dec0dec0dec0dec0dec0dec0dec0de';To derive the corresponding public keyvar publicKey = util.bufferToHex(util.privateToPublic(privateKey));and you should get the following if you print out publicKey0x4643bb6b393ac20a6175c713175734a72517c63d6f73a3ca90a15356f2e967da03d16431441c61ac69aeabb7937d333829d9da50431ff6af38536aa262497b27The Ethereum address associated with this private key is the last 160 bit of the SHA3\u2013256 (Keccak) hash of the public key.var address = '0x' + util.bufferToHex(util.sha3(publicKey)).slice(26);//0x53ae893e4b22d707943299a8d0c844df0e3d5557As you can observe, it is actually possible for multiple private keys to have the same address. An Ethereum account is associated with each address and each have the following attributesnonce the count of the number of outgoing transactions, starting with 0balance the amount of ether in the accountstorageRoot the hash associated with the storage of the accountcodeHash the hash of the code governing the account, if this is empty then the account is a normal account that can be accessed with its private key else it is a smart contract whose interactions are governed by its codeNext we take a look at a transaction, there are 6 input fieldsnonce the count of the number of outgoing transactions, starting with 0 gasPrice the price to determine the amount of ether the transaction will costgasLimit the maximum gas that is allowed to be spent to process the transactionto the account the transaction is sent to, if empty, the transaction will create a contractvalue the amount of ether to senddata could be an arbitrary message or function call to a contract or code to create a contractA transaction to send 1000 wei (1 ether = 10\u00b9\u2078 wei) of ether and leaving a 0xc0de message can be constructed as followsvar rawTx = {    nonce: web3.toHex(0),    gasPrice: web3.toHex(20000000000),    gasLimit: web3.toHex(100000),    to: '0x687422eEA2cB73B5d3e242bA5456b782919AFc85',    value: web3.toHex(1000),    data: '0xc0de'};Notice that the from address is not specified, it will be derived from the signature after signing with the private key. To sign the transactionvar p = new Buffer('c0dec0dec0dec0dec0dec0dec0dec0dec0dec0dec0dec0dec0dec0dec0dec0de', 'hex');var transaction = new tx(rawTx);transaction.sign(p);The transaction can then be sent to the network and will be tracked by a 256 bit transaction id. This transaction can be viewed at Etherscan. The transaction id is the hash of the transactionconsole.log(util.bufferToHex(transaction.hash(true)));//0x8b69a0ca303305a92d8d028704d65e4942b7ccc9a99917c8c9e940c9d57a9662Next we look at what makes up the data for a function call. Take for example the data of this transaction to a contractconsole.log(web3.eth.getTransaction('0xaf4a217f6cc6f8c79530203372f3fbec160da83d1abe048625a390ba1705dd57').input);//0xa9059cbb0000000000000000000000007adee867ea91533879d083dd47ea81f0eee3a37e000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000d02ab486cedbffffIn order to know which function it is calling, the functions of the contract must be known beforehand to create a hash table. The first 32 bit a9059cbb is the first 32 bit of the hash of the function. In this case the function is transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) and its hash isconsole.log(web3.sha3('transfer(address,uint256)'));//0xa9059cbb2ab09eb219583f4a59a5d0623ade346d962bcd4e46b11da047c9049bThis is followed by 256 bit for each argument, so in this case the address is0x0000000000000000000000007adee867ea91533879d083dd47ea81f0eee3a37eand the unsigned integer is0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000d02ab486cedbffffNext, as discussed above, by omitting the to field, a contract will be created. But how is the contract\u2019s address determined? Take for example this transactionconsole.log(web3.eth.getTransactionReceipt('0x77a4f46ff7bf8c084c34293fd654c60e107df42c5bcd2666f75c0b47a9352be5').contractAddress);//0x950041c1599529a9f64cf2be59ffb86072f00111The contract address is the last 160 bit hash of the sender address and its nonce can be determined beforehand. For this transaction, the sender and nonce can be found byvar contractTx = web3.eth.getTransaction('0x77a4f46ff7bf8c084c34293fd654c60e107df42c5bcd2666f75c0b47a9352be5');console.log(contractTx.from);//0x84f9d8b0e74a7060e20b025c1ea63c2b171bae6fconsole.log(contractTx.nonce);//0Thus the contract address isconsole.log('0x' + util.bufferToHex(util.rlphash(['0x84f9d8b0e74a7060e20b025c1ea63c2b171bae6f', 0])).slice(26));//0x950041c1599529a9f64cf2be59ffb86072f00111Now we have gotten to know a little bit more about these hexadecimals!Ethereum and smart contracts have huge potential to disrupt many industries.

SpencerFollowDec 15, 2018 \u00b7 9 min readIt\u2019s possible the hope of decentralization and dApps rests on Ethereum. It\u2019s doubtful others could repeat what Ethereum has done. That being said, the price of ETH is down today to $84.66.Figure this, January of 2018 saw it at $1,358. So it has lost more than 10x its value. Sure, they will say it has more daily active developers than ever. Of course, ConsenSys will tell you the good side of the story. I mean of course, its livelihood depends on it. But do crypto users or ETH transactions matter in the big scheme of things?When the going gets dirty, will Ethereum ever scale to mass adoption?Is ETH Dead?We need to be asking if there\u2019s a future in this iteration of public blockchains. Caught up in ICOs, fraud, security issues and certainly running amock with \u201cdecentralization\u201d pretenders, I would not trust ecosystems like EOS, Tron or XRP with a ten foot pole. You want to trust Ethereum, but their tech seems like legacy tech now. That\u2019s just how quickly things change.At the risk of sounding like a pathetic Forbes article and LinkedIn curated story on Bitcoin, the kids are not okay. They have been perpetuating fraud and get-rich-quick schemes and it\u2019s given all of crypto a bad name.Ethereum is the last hope for public blockchains, I really think so. I also think with the crypto winter it\u2019s running out of time to show it can scale. Ethereum was the biggest hope for an independent blockchain ecosystem, but its blockchain system has daunting technical problems to fix. Unfortunately, its disciples too need to figure out how to govern themselves. Decentralized governance has not provided a valid system to replace corporate governance structures and this has reached bottleneck proportions.Crypto could kill itself and the world may not careWhat happens when you have a bunch of 20-year-olds trying to reinvent technology with products that don\u2019t yet exist? With ecosystems that are faked and crowdfunding projects that have a near certainty of failure?The cryptocurrency world is crashing down and it isn\u2019t just like stock volatility, it has to do with the extinction of crypto and altcoins and things that were much in vogue just 12 short months ago. The death of Ethereum is a real question, the validity of Bitcoin as a digital asset is very much a debate when it\u2019s been reduced to below 3k.Ethereum was the original one after decentralization, a paradigm beyond centralization and beyond seeming magic internet money. However with governance models, consensus systems that allow the tech to be upgraded continuously, with the size of the community not really mattering all that much. Like the Bitcoin Cash hard fork, crypto has a weird and viscous cycle of self-destruction.Unlike blockchain, crypto was always an experiment of the young. The ultimate signal for profiteers that here was something to ride through global recessions. Then something weird happened, there hasn\u2019t been a global recession for nearly 12 years.Ethereum is already the most famous cryptocurrency after Bitcoin and the third largest in total value. But does it matter anymore?The central topic at Devcon is \u201cEthereum 2.0,\u201d a radical upgrade that would finally allow the network to realize its true power. But is it too late? Does it matter that the copy cats grow? Is Ethereum dying and pegged with Bitcoin like martyrdom for technological oblivion as we enter a tech dystopia dominated by the monster that is the Centralization of Silicon Valley and then Chinese companies?You can have all the idealism in the world, but what if your product simply doesn\u2019t scale, won\u2019t be allowed to scale by the system? Surely Ethereum has a handful of idealistic researchers, developers, and administrators in charge of maintaining its software \u2014 who know that the time is nearly up to prove that public blockchains matter at all (under a long list of technical challenges and possibly irremovable limitations). Maybe we were too soon, maybe we were dumb to hype up a nascent technology where sentiment ran away from reality. I\u2019m ready to admit that. The idealism of youth can amount to being a scam, it\u2019s happened to us all once.As per etherscan, as many as 353 million transactions have been processed by the network to date. That\u2019s not a mind bending amount, all things considered. Since June 1, the average number of daily transactions has been roughly 610,000 [source]. That\u2019s not exactly impressive, to be honest.In the winners and the losers of crypto, we always thought Ethereum would be the one to reincarnate some leadership into crypto after Bitcoin\u2019s shine dimmed. However crypto is tied at the hip to Bitcoin\u2019s price, a huge failure of cryptoeconomics to differentiate itself from other markets. Market forces still rule \u2014 and it shows the depravity of the current \u2018system\u2019. Innovation is stunted by the centralization of the system itself.Crackdowns by regulators and a growing understanding of how far most blockchain applications are from being ready for prime time have not just scared many cryptocurrency investors away, it\u2019s screwed the freedom that crypto could have brought us and instead replaced it with fraud, failures and a technology that doesn\u2019t scale very well either technically or for actual consumers. There\u2019s a bottom of sentiment on blockchain\u2019s readiness to disrupt, period.Ethereum as a ragtag community needs to crack a problem on human governance but how can we expect a bunch of bohemian engineers to do it? Failures of leadership are rife in nearly every industry and system of human society in 2018. We see it in corrupt politicians, greedy tech executives, unethical engineers and, of course, crypto profiteers who especially abused the ICO system. EOS is a perfect example of this. Ethereum might be more attractive to developers, but it may not have as bright a future as blockchain-as-a-service in the Cloud does, led by the likes of Alibaba and Amazon. The market necessitates centralized blockchains before we are ever near decentralization taking place. Crypto might have to die for its equivalent when it is ready to be born.It might be painful to accept, but Ethereum might have to die for public blockchains to evolve. Ethereum won\u2019t be able to organize a scattered global network of contributors and stakeholders without sacrificing \u201cdecentralization\u201d. It\u2019s just not realistic. It would be better if Amazon acquired it and funded it. You can\u2019t reinvent the wheel of how businesses and organizations can or should work. You need to strike a balance with reality.Bitcoin has been so spoiled by infighting and gridlock and a few wallets owning too much of it, it has been forever spoiled. Ethereum\u2019s demise could occur in any number of ways. First and foremost by failing to scale, or even failing to scale fast enough before something better comes along. These kids did not think long-term enough, they couldn\u2019t foresee the challenges of the future well enough. Decentralization was a spontaneous whim, but the world and the tech wasn\u2019t/isn\u2019t ready.You can peddle crypto kitties, but the world disrupts itself. Ethereum is no longer seen as a leader of the model of public blockchains. There is no world computer, or if there is it has more to do with the Cloud and the future of artificial intelligence \u2014 the major macro trends of the 2020s. Blockchain is, at best, a minor trend in technology compared to those two. Let\u2019s not forget, crypto exists in an age of exponential technologies. If it doesn\u2019t work, it\u2019s not going to ruin the world, just seriously stunt the value proposition of decentralization and the idea that blockchains should be distributed in a decentralized manner. In 2018, the internet is a weapon. IP is stolen each month, worth more than the total crypto market cap combined.We live in uncertain times, and public blockchains like ETH are the most uncertain of long-term bets. The sad reality is that capitalism doesn't want to change, never mind democracy\u2019s crisis of leadership. The inertia of the world underestimates crypto and crypto overestimates itself.For Ethereum\u2019s most ardent dreamers and believers, crypto is like a religion. In its dogma is contained the promise of an entirely new kind of democratic society in which it is much harder to concentrate wealth and power, hide corruption, and exert shady, behind-the-scenes influence. Yet in the process crypto has become all the things it said it could erase from the corrupt and materialistic corporate world. Crypto because a fraud with our money. And for that it deserves some punishment. Some form of banishment, these rock-bottom prices, they are justified.A year ago \u2014 practically centuries in crypto time \u2014 investors were pouring billions of dollars into promising projects building dApps. Ethereum felt like the angel of blockchain innovation, but how quickly things do change. America shunned them, the banks called them a ponzi scheme, and the rest is history. The SEC is now targeting the shadiest ICOs and projects, and a raw pessimism has gripped the community, many of whom were nothing more than profiteers to begin with.Crypto, my dear, where to now?Ethereum may have gotten too popular too fast and while tethered to ICOs they lost their way as a solution that seemed to be Bitcoin's heir apparent. Even the fad of Crypto kitties pointed to something inevitable \u2014 they slowed Ethereum to a halt and it exposed the truth: Ethereum\u2019s technology is immature, incapable of handling the kinds of workloads that big dApps would demand. The dire realization that Ethereum (2.0) Serenity might take (years) too long was daunting.By the time Ethereum 2.0 might be ready, all of crypto might be dead.Vitalik Buterin\u2019s white paper of 2013 might be forgotten. Bitcoin\u2019s Satoshi Nakamoto must be shaking its head. How did we come so far to suffer such a fate? Ethereum might die, along with all other cryptos. It could happen, we have to accept that possibility. What would come after it?The youthful immaturity of its founders, is probably part of the problem. Buterin, Ethereum\u2019s enigmatic young creator, uses an only slightly less pejorative comparison, calling it \u201ca smartphone from 1999 that can play Snake.\u201d Wtf , I have no idea what he was talking about. Talk of \u201cworld computers\u201d and decentralization bores me, after realizing what projects such as EOS and Dfinity truly stand for.Were we misled by profiteers? Engineers of a fake new internet that was destined to fail? Scores of investors and entrepreneurs had overestimated what Ethereum\u2019s blockchain can do\u200a\u2014\u200awill become\u200a\u2014\u200aor that crypto was disruptive at all. 2019 might be the last year of the altcoin. Fiasco after crypto fraud, we\u2019ve lost a bit of the soul of what crypto was in the first place. The last temple and template might be Ethereum, but Ethereum isn\u2019t exactly a paradise. We might be witnessing the Fall of Ethereum, and I say this with no specific bias one way or the other (I don\u2019t own any ETH).There\u2019s something cynical and ridiculous in what blockchain and crypto has become in 2019. Just as Bitcoin HODLers felt somewhat fanatic in 2018. Where is the product, guys? Show me the shards, bro.In ConclusionDecentralized computing platforms are nice in theory, they might even have built incredible communities, but without the technology to scale and sustain them, what is the point? We re-invented what decentralization was, only to find the corrupt world hated the idea so much they helped us kill it, like a threat to their hierarchies, banks, false authorities and corrupt world order. If Bitcoin and Ethereum dies, I\u2019m not sure anything else will take its place, for maybe decades.There may realistically be no such thing as freedom from online censorship, surveillance, and other forms of centralized power. This is because we are entering a period of history characterized by centralized technology corporations, not exiting it. 2018 is not 2063, bro, the world has no intention of becoming more decentralized or letting a bunch of 20-something-year-olds hold the keys to the portal into the future.Ethereum is beautiful, and it is beautiful flawed. Bitcoin is not decentralized since its wallets belong to a few. The public blockchain is not growing like the Cloud is, nor will it impact the world like machine learning or any other number of important technologies.3,000 developers and entrepreneurs, largely men in their 20s and 30s, cannot save the world. Ethereum doesn\u2019t scale, and it won\u2019t be able to scale in 2019 any better than in 2018. That\u2019s a fact, let\u2019s kill the fiction and hype from crypto. Ethereum might not be the one.", "responses": 79, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Ethereum", "Technology", "Decentralization", "Cryptocurrency"]}, {"title": "Full Stack Hello World Voting Ethereum Dapp Tutorial \u2014 Part 2", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@mvmurthy/full-stack-hello-world-voting-ethereum-dapp-tutorial-part-2-30b3d335aa1f?source=search_post", "author_name": "Mahesh Murthy", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@mvmurthy", "publish_date": "2017-01-31", "last_modified_date": "2018-11-10", "readtime": "6.83", "claps": 3041, "voters": 409, "content": "Full Stack Hello World Voting Ethereum Dapp Tutorial \u2014 Part 2Mahesh MurthyFollowJan 31, 2017 \u00b7 7 min read[Tutorial was last updated in November 2018]This is part 2 of 3 part series of tutorials. You can access Part 1 and Part 3 here.In part 1 of this tutorial, we built a simple voting application in our development environment using ganache. Now, let\u2019s get this application on the real blockchain. Ethereum has a few public test blockchains and one main blockchain.Testnet: There are a few test blockchains such as Ropsten, Rinkeby, Kovan. Think of these as a QA or a staging server, they are used for testing purposes only. All the Ether you use on these networks is fake.Mainnet (also called Homestead): This is the blockchain which the entire world transacts on for real. There is real value to the Ether you use on this network.In this tutorial, we will accomplish the following:Install geth \u2014 the client software used to download the blockchain and run the Ethereum node on your local machine.Install the Ethereum dapp framework called Truffle which will be used for compiling and deploying our contract.Make small updates to our Voting application to make it work using truffle.Compile and deploy the contract to the Rinkeby testnet.Interact with the contract through truffle console and then through a webpage.1. Install geth and sync the blockchainIt takes a many hours to sync the chain depending on your hardware and internet speed. You can skip this step and continue to use ganache if you are unable to sync the chain.I have installed and tested everything on MacOS and Ubuntu. Installation is pretty straightforward:On Mac:mahesh@projectblockchain:~$ brew tap ethereum/ethereummahesh@projectblockchain:~$ brew install ethereumOn Ubuntu:mahesh@projectblockchain:~$ sudo apt-get install software-properties-commonmahesh@projectblockchain:~$ sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:ethereum/ethereummahesh@projectblockchain:~$ sudo apt-get updatemahesh@projectblockchain:~$ sudo apt-get install ethereumYou can find installation instructions for various platforms here: https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Building-EthereumOnce you have installed geth, run the below command in your command line console:mahesh@projectblockchain:~$ geth --rinkeby --syncmode \"fast\" --rpc --rpcapi db,eth,net,web3,personal --cache=1024  --rpcport 8545 --rpcaddr 127.0.0.1 --rpccorsdomain \"*\"This will start the Ethereum node, connect to other peer nodes and start downloading the blockchain. The time it takes to download the blockchain depends on various factors like your internet connection speed, RAM on your computer, type of hard drive etc. It took me 30\u201345 minutes on a machine which has 8GB RAM and 50Mbps connection.In the console where you have geth running, you will see the output like below. Look for the block number which is in bold. When your blockchain is fully sync\u2019d, the block number you see will be close to the block number on this page: https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/I0130 22:18:15.116332 core/blockchain.go:1064] imported   32 blocks,    49 txs (  6.256 Mg) in 185.716ms (33.688 Mg/s). #445097 [e1199364\u2026 / bce20913\u2026]I0130 22:18:20.267142 core/blockchain.go:1064] imported    1 blocks,     1 txs (  0.239 Mg) in  11.379ms (20.963 Mg/s). #445097 [b4d77c46\u2026]I0130 22:18:21.059414 core/blockchain.go:1064] imported    1 blocks,     0 txs (  0.000 Mg) in   7.807ms ( 0.000 Mg/s). #445098 [f990e694\u2026]I0130 22:18:34.367485 core/blockchain.go:1064] imported    1 blocks,     0 txs (  0.000 Mg) in   4.599ms ( 0.000 Mg/s). #445099 [86b4f29a\u2026]I0130 22:18:42.953523 core/blockchain.go:1064] imported    1 blocks,     2 txs (  0.294 Mg) in   9.149ms (32.136 Mg/s). #445100 [3572f223\u2026]2. Install the Truffle FrameworkInstall truffle using npm. The truffle version being used in this tutorial is 3.1.1.npm install -g truffle*Depending on your system setup, you might have to add a sudo at the beginning.3. Set up the voting contractFirst step is to set up the truffle project:mahesh@projectblockchain:~$ mkdir votingmahesh@projectblockchain:~$ cd votingmahesh@projectblockchain:~/voting$ npm install -g webpackmahesh@projectblockchain:~/voting$ truffle unbox webpackmahesh@projectblockchain:~/voting$ lsREADME.md               contracts               node_modules            test                    webpack.config.js       truffle.jsapp                     migrations              package.json            mahesh@projectblockchain:~/voting$ ls app/index.html  scripts  stylesmahesh@projectblockchain:~/voting$ ls contracts/ConvertLib.sol  MetaCoin.sol  Migrations.solmahesh@projectblockchain:~/voting$ ls migrations/1_initial_migration.js  2_deploy_contracts.jsAs you can see above, truffle creates the necessary files and directories required to run a full stack dapp. Truffle also creates a sample application to get you started (we won\u2019t be using it in this tutorial). You can safely delete the ConvertLib.sol and MetaCoin.sol files in the contracts directory for this project.It is important to understand the contents of the migrations directory. These migration files are used to deploy the contracts to the blockchain. (If you remember, in the previous post, we used VotingContract.new to deploy the contract to the blockchain, we don\u2019t need to do that anymore). The very first migration 1_initial_migration.js deploys a contract named Migrations to the blockchain and is used to store the latest contract you have deployed. Every time you run the migration, truffle queries the blockchain to get the last contract that has been deployed and then deploys any contracts which haven\u2019t been deployed yet. It then updates the last_completed_migration field in the Migrations contract to indicate the latest contract deployed. You can simply think of it as a database table called Migration with a column named last_completed_migration which is kept up to date always. You can find more details on the truffle documentation page.Let\u2019s now update the project with all the code we wrote in the previous tutorial with few changes explained below.First, copy over the Voting.sol from the previous tutorial to the contracts directory (there are no changes to this file).mahesh@projectblockchain:~/voting$ ls contracts/Migrations.sol  Voting.solNext, replace the contents of 2_deploy_contracts.js in the migrations directory with the following:var Voting = artifacts.require(\"./Voting.sol\");module.exports = function(deployer) {  deployer.deploy(Voting, ['Rama', 'Nick', 'Jose'], {gas: 6700000});};/* As you can see above, the deployer expects the first argument to   be the name of the contract followed by constructor arguments. In our case, there is only one argument which is an array ofcandidates. The third argument is a hash where we specify the gas required to deploy our code. The gas amount varies depending on the size of your contract.*/You can also set the gas value as a global setting in truffle.js. Go ahead and add the gas option like below so in the future if you forget to set the gas in specific migration file, it will by default use the global value.require('babel-register')module.exports = {  networks: {    ganache: {      host: 'localhost',      port: 8545,      network_id: '*',      gas: 4700000    }  }}Replace the contents of app/scripts/index.js with the contents below.Replace the contents of app/index.html with the following. Even this file is pretty much the same as last chapter except the js file included is app.js on line 41.4. Deploy the contract to Rinkeby test networkBefore we can deploy the contract, we will need an account and some ether. When we used ganache, it created 10 test accounts and came preloaded with 100 test ethers. But for testnet and mainnet we have to create the account and add some ether ourselves.In your command line terminal, do the following:mahesh@projectblockchain:~/voting$ truffle consoletruffle(default)> web3.personal.newAccount('verystrongpassword')'0x95a94979d86d9c32d1d2ab5ace2dcc8d1b446fa1'truffle(default)> web3.eth.getBalance('0x95a94979d86d9c32d1d2ab5ace2dcc8d1b446fa1'){ [String: '0'] s: 1, e: 0, c: [ 0 ] }truffle(default)> web3.personal.unlockAccount('0x95a94979d86d9c32d1d2ab5ace2dcc8d1b446fa1', 'verystrongpassword', 15000)// Replace 'verystrongpassword' with a good strong password.// The account is locked by default, make sure to unlock it before using the account for deploying and interacting with the blockchain.In the previous post, we started a node console and initialized the web3 object. When we execute truffle console, all of that is done for us and we get a web3 object ready to use. We now have an account with address \u20180x95a94979d86d9c32d1d2ab5ace2dcc8d1b446fa1\u2019 (you will have a different address in your case) and the balance will be 0.You can get some test ether for Rinkeby network through the faucet here: https://faucet.rinkeby.io/. Try web3.eth.getBalance again to make sure you have ether. You can also enter your address on rinkeby.etherscan.io to see your account balance.

INGOT Coin is pleased to announce the formation of a new alliance, Komorebi.https://t.me/KomorebiAllianceIt is no secret that the recent volatility in the market has been extreme with Bitcoin and Ethereum prices in freefall. Market participants are suffering losses but also given the opportunity to invest at lower prices to gain if the market pulls up.Cryptocurrency investor Brian Kelly, states on CCN \u201cReferring back to the basic rule of investing, Kelly noted that during a period in which the market is extremely bullish and optimistic, it is better to sell and eye a timely opportunity to enter and when the market is overly pessimistic, it is wise to look for a position to enter.\u201dBitcoin originally was supposed to offer an efficient means of transferring money over the internet and is controlled by a decentralized network with a transparent set of rules, thus presenting an alternative to central bank controlled fiat money.Market participants changed from geeks and believers in Blockchain to funds and investors looking to make profit with the uptrend volatile market. This led people to ignore the primary function of Bitcoin which was to efficiently transfer money over the internet with no control from central banks.This is affecting the whole markets including the new ICOs and tokens. New ICOs and tokens are simply being invested in to sell once listed and gain whatever discount rate the ICO is offering. Most of the time these tokens are tied to the price volatility and movement of Bitcoin and Ethereum. INGOT Coin has been studying the market carefully in order to develop in ways that are separated from Bitcoin and Ethereum as well as their price volatilityINGOT Coin, GMEX-Group, BolttCoin, Modern Finance Chain (MFChain), SwachhCoin, Black.Insure, PlaceToRent (PTRT), Bineuro and Stella have all formed a unified front under one alliance.The group of ICOs along with plan to establish a single platform that will allow all their communities to use their utilities simultaneously. Furthermore, plans of enabling different discounts among each one of the ICOs is being discussed in order to give edge to all participants.The Alliance believes that by bringing together different ICOs from different industries such as health, insurance, financial services, E-commerce and real estate, and combining the different existing Utility Functions a new meaning to Utility will be created.Instead of having a couple of utility benefits from one ICO, why not have many more benefits from a unified group of ICOs working together? All partners in the alliance will work together to create one user friendly and up-to-date platform providing access to their tokens and utilities.INGOT Coin is about building an interconnected global community of trust and cooperation \u2014 the basis of which is honesty and transparency between its members. At INGOT, we believe that it is the right of all people to seize control of their lives; whether personally, socially, or financially.

In the last 24 hours one game developer earned more than $500,000 from Ethereum game. But let\u2019s start from scratch.I am familiar with this data because I run a website called DappRadar. It tracks most of Ethereum games and ranks them based on the 24-hour performance. Check it out to find new apps! But let\u2019s keep going.What is an Ethereum game ?We call these games as Ethereum games because their code runs in Ethereum blockchain. Most often not all the code, but the one that is responsible for the main logic of the game.What is in it for me ?Almost all Ethereum games have one thing in common \u2014 they are all open source. It means that everyone can read the code of the game and make sure it does not have any shady intentions.Imagine a private MMORPG game server where admins and owners have strict permissions and they have no way to sell superb weapons for real money. That is the power of blockchain. No corruption. You can code these permissions and everyone can read them to make sure you are not cheating.And CryptoCountries is one of these transparent Ethereum games.What is CryptoCountries ?CryptoCountries is an Ethereum game where you can purchase a land on virtual map. Once you purchase a land for a certain price, that price increases and anyone can buy it from you too. If that happens, you receive that amount to your wallet. Basically, if someone buys a land from you, you earn Ether.How does the developer earn ?I have read the code of the game and from each transaction developer gets a fee. The fee is 2\u20135% of transaction value. The bigger the value is, the lower the fee percent is. For example, buying a land for 10 ETH would have a 2% fee while purchasing one for 0.05 ETH would cost a 5% fee.But\u2026 $500,000 in 24 hours?Yep. Simple as that. CryptoCountries went viral this morning and in less than 24 hours its users made transactions for 31,546 ETH. That is roughly $28,600,000 (according to this moment\u2019s Ether course of $906).We already know that the lowest fee for a transaction is 2% and we stick to this number. $28,600,000 * 0.02 = $572,000. This is the lowest amount the developer could have earned if all the transactions were over 5 Ether. It could have been 1 million dollars, it is hard to calculate the exact amount. But we clearly know that it was over half a million in\u2026 one day.DappRadar.comThat is it for now! Thank you for reading. Find trending ethereum games on ethereum games list \u2014 DappRadar.com.

Here we are starting an entirely new and separate blockchain that cannot interact with Ethereum mainnet.Starting your own Ethereum blockchain is useful, educational, and safer than the public testnet. Learning to set up a private testnet provides tangibility to otherwise abstract concepts such as mining, network peers, and even the geth datadir.PrerequisitesYou need to have Geth installed. The easiest way to do this is through homebrew.Open Terminal and install homebrewruby -e \u201c$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\"2. Now install gethbrew tap ethereum/ethereumbrew install ethereumCreate Genesis FileThe Genesis block is the first block in the chain, the Genesis file is a JSON file that defines the characteristics of that initial block and subsequently the rest of the blockchain.Create a directory to hold your network filesmkdir my-eth-chaincd my-eth-chain2. Create your genesis filetouch myGenesis.json3. Open your genesis file and paste the following{   \"config\": {      \"chainId\": 1994,      \"homesteadBlock\": 0,      \"eip155Block\": 0,      \"eip158Block\": 0,      \"byzantiumBlock\": 0   },   \"difficulty\": \"400\",   \"gasLimit\": \"2000000\",   \"alloc\": {      \"7b684d27167d208c66584ece7f09d8bc8f86ffff\": {           \"balance\": \"100000000000000000000000\"       },      \"ae13d41d66af28380c7af6d825ab557eb271ffff\": {           \"balance\": \"120000000000000000000000\"       }   }}configchainId \u2014 this is your chain\u2019s identifier, and is used in replay protection.homesteadBlock, eip155Block, eip158Block, byzantiumBlock \u2014 these relate to chain forking and versioning, so in our case lets leave them 0 since we\u2019re starting a new blockchain.difficultyThis dictates how difficult it is to mine a block. Setting this value low (~10\u201310000) is helpful in a private blockchain as it lets you mine blocks quickly, which equals fast transactions, and plenty of ETH to test with. For comparison, the Ethereum mainnet Genesis file defines a difficulty of 17179869184.gasLimitThis is the the total amount of gas that can be used in each block. With such a low mining difficulty, blocks will be moving pretty quick, but you should still set this value pretty high to avoid hitting the limit and slowing down your network.allocHere you can allocate ETH to specific addresses. This won\u2019t create the account for you, so make sure its an account you already have control of. You will need to add the account to your private chain in order to use it, and to do that you need access to the keystore/utc file. For example, Geth and MyEtherWallet give you access to this file when you create an account, but Metamask and Coinbase do not. The addresses provided are not real addresses, they are just examples. Here we allocate 100,000 and 120,000 ETH respectively.Start your Node!Now the real fun begins, we\u2019re all set to fire up our new Ethereum blockchain.1. Instantiate your data directorygeth --datadir ./myDataDir init ./myGenesis.json2. Start your Ethereum peer node.Networkid helps ensure the privacy of your network. You can use any number here (where we used \u201c1114\u201d), but other peers joining your network must use the same one.geth --datadir ./myDataDir --networkid 1114 console 2>> myEth.logOutput should look like this:Welcome to the Geth JavaScript console!instance: Geth/v1.7.3-stable-4bb3c89d/darwin-amd64/go1.8.3coinbase: 0xae13d41d66af28380c7af6d825ab557eb271ffffat block: 5 (Thu, 07 Dec 2017 17:08:48 PST)datadir: /Users/test/my-eth-chain/myDataDirmodules: admin:1.0 clique:1.0 debug:1.0 eth:1.0 miner:1.0 net:1.0 personal:1.0 rpc:1.0 txpool:1.0 web3:1.0>This is the geth JavaScript console.

The aim of this article is to give an overview of Ethereum sharding design and explain how explicit finality helps for blockchain sharding.To fully understand the specification of Ethereum sharding mechanism proposal, I highly recommend digging in sharding doc [2] by Vitalik.Blockchain Scalability IssuesGrowth of transactions. We love unicorns and kittens.Limitation of scalability with current block creation process. Block gas limit restricts the computational capacity of the block. Increasing block gas limit or decreasing block time too much would lead to high stale rate and weaken the ability of the network against attacks.Lack of parallelizability. First, current EVM operates transactions in sequence. Second, every full node executes each transaction and store the whole (or pruned) state trie for security and decentralization.Further reading: EIP 648 \u2014 Easy parallelizability for executing transactions in parallel.To solve scalability problems, sharding is a solution that introduces to on-chain state partition and gains higher throughput.source: https://pixabay.com/photo-2695569/ (CC0 Creative Commons)TerminologyAt first, let\u2019s take a look at terms for differentiating the objects on main chain (you can take as the current Mainnet chain) or shard chain in different levels:Table 1. Terminology.You can simply imagine that the transactions would be wrapped in a \u201ccollation\u201d; similar to block, a collation also points to its parent collation in chains \u2014 that\u2019s the shard chains we\u2019re going to talk about. Being a \u201ccollator\u201d means having the eligibility to propose a new collation on the proof-of-stake shard chain.Figure 1. A glimpse of basic collation data structure.Basic Quadratic ShardingThe Consensus of Shard Chain Depends on Main ChainSimilar to side chain technology, only the small pieces of proof of collations have to be recorded on main chain \u2014 that\u2019s the basic idea of how we scale out the blockchain: (i) the shard chains have their own galaxy with their own transactions, shard validators only have to verify the shard they are watching for; (ii) shard chains also stick on main chain universe for reaching higher level of consensus via proof-of-stake mechanism.Validator Manager Contract (VMC)For joining shard chains on main chain, there\u2019s going to be a special contract on main chain called Validator Manager Contract (VMC). VMC is the core of this sharding mechanism; the purpose of VMC can be outlined as follows:Proof-of-stake system. The validators\u2019 stake may be slashed if they misbehaved.Pseudorandomness sampling. By applying recent block hash as the seed to sample the eligible collator. Basically, the validators deposit their stake in VMC, and then their validation code address would be recorded in a global validators pool list inside VMC. One shard chain validator would be sampled from validators pool list, and become the collator of the specific shards in specific \u201cperiod\u201d (as it will be explained below). The idea is making validators unable to forecast when they would be the collator and in which shard many days ago.Collation header validation. VMC contains an addHeader(bytes collationHeader) function to verify the collation header and writing a record of valid collation header hash. This function provides on-chain verification immediately.Cross-shard communication. By utilizing UTXO model, the user can deposit ether on a specific shard via transaction call and create a receipt (with a receipt ID) on main chain. The shard chain user can create a receipt-consuming transaction with the given receipt ID to spend this receipt.On-chain governance. With VMC as the parliament, it enables validators to vote on-chain.How to Propose a Collation in Shard?In phase 1, VMC would maintain 100 shards (SHARD_COUNT = 100). Each shard operates in parallel and the clients of shard i only have to verify the transactions on shard i.\u201cperiod\u201d is defined as a window of block times, e.g., PERIOD_LENGTH = 5 means 5 blocks per period. This indicated in each period, there\u2019s only lesser than or equal to one valid collation for each shard.Figure 2 (a). Quadratic sharding. The proofs of shard states would be recorded on main chain VMC.Once the validator gets sampled to be eligible collator to propose a new collation, the collator has to validate the recent collations and send a transaction to call addHeader function. Note that if the collator is sampled to propose a new collation on period 10, that means the addHeader transaction has to be included in period 10, i.e., block number10 * PERIOD_LENGTH to block number (10 + 1) * PERIOD_LENGTH \u2014 1.Figure 2 (b). For one shard, only one collation per period; one block can include multiple addHeader transactions of different shards.The collation header hash must be recorded on VMC to prove its header is valid in global. Also, the other validators of the shard have to watch VMC all the time for getting latest status and then verify if the transactions are valid too.Fork Choice Rule of Shard ChainIn basic sharding, the fork choice rule depends on the longest main chain. The valid head collation of the given shard is not simply the head collation of \u201clongest valid shard chain\u201d but the \u201cthe longest valid shard chain within the longest valid main chain\u201d.An example is described in Figure 3: in Figure 3(a), there are two forks of main chain and the second chain is the longest valid main chain in the following figure. Since block B3 is the head block, it\u2019s easy to see that collation C3 is the head collation.Figure 3 (a).And then block B3' arrives in Figure 3 (b). Assume that the score of block B3 is higher than the score of block B3', so the upper chain is still the longest main chain:Figure 3(b).Lastly, block 4 arrives in Figure 3 (c). Note that for this shard, collation C3 has a higher score than collation C2, but the below chain is the longest valid main chain, so collation C2 is the head collation now:Figure 3 (c).Further reading: another design \u2014 Vlad Zamfir\u2019s sharded fork choice rule. \ud83e\udd8c\ud83c\udf32\ud83c\udf81An ingenious design for guaranteeing blocks atomicity before they are finalized.Trade-off between Scalability and SecurityBlockchain systems can only at most have two of the following three properties: decentralization, scalability, and security.\u2014 Blockchain Trilemma in Sharding FAQ [3]The limitation of scalability is based on the security guarantees of the system [3]. While we increased TPS (Transactions Per Second) by distributing transactions to shards, we also decreased computational resources for each transaction consequently.One of the important mechanism of sharding is how to produce randomness on-chain.The chance of being selected as collator should only be relevant and proportional to the validator\u2019s deposit.If the validators can predict or choose which shard they will participate in arbitrarily, the dishonest validators can collude with each other and start an adaptive attack.If the sampling process fails to select with high randomness, it\u2019s possible for an attacker to start 1% attack in the shard: if there are 100 shards, the attacker can focus on attack one particular shard, they only need 1% hash rate (PoW)/deposit (PoS) to control the shard [4].Figure 4. Traditional majority attack (51 % Attack)Figure 5. Sharding 1% attackBlockchain Explicit Finality for ShardingImplicit Finality v.s. Explicit FinalityAt first, I have to clarify that the sharding mechanism should be able to apply in both proof-of-work chain and proof-of-stake chain; even so, explicit finality gadget like Casper can make sharding stronger.In general proof-of-work chains, finality is probabilistic and implicit [1] [5]; in simpler words, it\u2019s always possible to rewrite the chain even the block has gotten thousands of confirmations. In contrast, applying proof-of-stake with Casper the Friendly Finality Gadget (\u201cFFG\u201d) cryptoeconomic mechanism explicitly enforces finality of we-can-check-if-its-finalized-for-us in-protocol.[Notes from Vlad] There\u2019s an economic risk of in-protocol explicit finality threshold: it creates the ideal cartel sizes at 2/3 + 1 and 1/3 + 1. Accordingly, the marginal contribution to finality of any node which is not in 2/3 + 1 coalition becomes 0. \ud83e\udd52Dependency on Main Chain FinalityIn basic sharding, the shard chains are pegging on main chain.To the shard validators, we expect with sharding, the blockchain capacity became 100x higher in phase 1, thus all the validators of these 100 shards will need to watch VMC status to get the correct valid head collation. It\u2019s important for validators to be certain of know they are the collator or not as soon as possible; to the normal users, if we apply cross-shard transactions in phase 2, the normal users will also need to retrieve their deposit information (receipt ID) on VMC.Explicit finality would help for mitigating the uncertainty of syncing between main chain and massive shard chains.Explicit Finality Helps for Stateless ClientThe basic idea of stateless clients is that the stateless clients don\u2019t store the whole state trie, instead, they only store the state trie root. The archival clients store the full state trie and provide the Merkle branches that the given collation needs. With these Merkle branches, the stateless clients are capable of building the partial state trie and verifying the collation [6].The syncing process would be triggered once the validator gets sampled and starts reshuffling (i.e., changing the shards which the validators watch for and syncing the shard chains). With stateless client mechanism, the cost of reshuffling drops to (near) zero because they only have to validate the recent collations (i.e., collations with high score) to sync with the shard.Figure 6. Stateless client model. (Icons made by DinosoftLabs from www.flaticon.com is licensed by CC 3.0 BY)Since the syncing process could be much faster, stateless client model makes it possible to reshuffle between each collation. It not only reduces the storage burden and overhead but also makes the system more secure because frequent sampling gains adaptive attack resistance.Although the syncing cost becomes much lower, the stateless validators still have to verify as more collations as they can within a certain period of time to confirm that they get the best valid collation with the highest score.Casper FFG will provide explicit finality threshold after about 2.5 \u201cepoch times\u201d, i.e., 125 block times [1] [7]. If validators can verify more than 125 / PERIOD_LENGHT = 25 collations during reshuffling, the shard system can benefit from explicit finality and be more confident of the 25 ahead collations from now are all finalized.Note that of course, it\u2019s more secure if we have more collations get verified on syncing.ConclusionI wish I gave a preliminary brief of current Ethereum sharding design concept and how explicit finality benefits sharding mechanism.

However, the trading of digital assets is concentrated in centralized exchange. What kind of products users can trade is determined by the exchange. Decentralized transactions have become a new popular trend now, but the launch of the project is still central. As the leader of decentralization, EtherFlyer will launch a self-service digital token online, which aims to establish a more free market. EtherFlyer is gradually transitioning to decentralization in both transaction and currency, providing an efficient, fast and cost-free online platform for all quality projects.Unprecedented speed: Click submission, online tomorrowMany platforms have lanunched self service token online, but they are mostly in the form, or the audit process is complicated, or the official response is extremely slow. However, EtherFlyer will launch the self service token online completely to aviod these drawbacks. You only need to fill out the form and submit it online. The project party does not need to contact the platform multiple times, long-term tracking. You just need to fill in the information correctly and quickly to go online. After the project party submits the key informaton, the professional team will verify the information immediately, and the transaction will be online at the next day.After the project party submits, the professional team will immediately verify the information, and the transaction will be online as soon as possible in the next day. Because there is no interference in the interests of free. The uniform submission of a unified review ensures fairness. What EtherFlyer needs to do is to return to the nature of the blockchain, realize de-centralization and minimize human interference. The advantages of de-centralization are fairness, openness and efficiency. EtherFlyer\u2019s self-help token launching is to fully reflect these advantages rather than just having a taste of de-centralization.Equally fair: rules are simple, open and transparent.Many exchanges are inconsistent with the attitude, service and price of the project. They slaughtered a big project and were indifferent to small projects. The task of EtherFlyer is to make all rules, regulations, services and standards public and to implement them indifferently in the mechanism of self-financing. Regardless of the size of the project and the amount of funds, they can get the same high-quality services quickly as long as high-quality projects are available on EtherFlyer.In terms of rules, EtherFlyer has also made the most simplification in ten articles. The basic information is also provided by the project providers who need to help themselves. The most important thing is to confirm that the contract address is accurate and no additional conditions and complicated requirements. Other exchanges require certification, grading and review of various institutions, which are not required in EtherFlyer. EtherFlyer hopes to improve the status quo of the industry by making it easier for project owners to pay attention to development and operation.Open the door to the project: The free token launching and service is the main thing.There are so many people who claim they can free to apply token online. There are numerous people who claim to be free of online coin, such as platform currency voting, recharge ranking, margin and other modes, which imply high costs, even more expensive and more process than paying for currency. EtherFlyer\u2019s self help token launching is really free: fill in the form and submit it online. Everything is so simple and direct, no vote, no rankings, no margin and other hidden costs.EtherFlyer will be open-minded in welcoming high-quality projects, without conditions, no fees, no differentiated services, and with the sincerity of decentralization to achieve common creation, win-win, progress and retreat. Projectors are no longer unable to online token and investors are not subject to restrictions, which is the de-centralized trading environment EtherFlyer hopes to achieve.At the same time, EtherFlyer will open various value-added services in coins, which will be purchased independently according to the needs of the project. They can be sold in packages or in one way. Currently, the value-added services open include support from Chinese and English media. EtherFlyer\u2019s deep operation uses 20 large media to publicize projects or activities. This includes official website support: Banner, home page, announcement center, and even theme page customization. We will try our best to satisfy each other in the form of mutual benefit and win-win situation.Online activities include airdrop, competition design, copywriting and publication, trading ranking, activity registration forms and other activities. All of these activities can be customized to keep the whole activity fair, transparent and authentic. Only high quality activities can really increase the activity of the project.True and pure neutrality: objective review of eliminating interestsThe factors influencing the traditional platform selection include the relationship, strength, scale and so on. Of course, the greatest impact is related interests, which leads to the difficulty of high-quality projects online, poor-quality projects are very active. This interest brings multiple standards, making the difficulty of different projects very different. This makes it possible for low-quality projects willing to spend money to go online immediately, while high-quality projects focused on development are neglected. EtherFlyer\u2019s self-service currency is completely non-interest-related, free, public submission, audit and other guarantees the neutrality of the platform.Such a practice is groundbreaking and brave. EtherFlyer strives to make the industry healthier by removing the huge grey income of the industry through the characteristics of decentralization, transparency, fairness and openness. EtherFlyer returns the funds that should belong to the development and operation of the project party to the original owner, so that the project party no longer has a place to use by throwing money on the line and false propaganda. All projects are on the same table and fair competition. EtherFlyer\u2019s self-listing program restores the platform\u2019s proper state. Investors should have the right of comprehensive comparison and self-choice, which should not be deprived of by centralization. EtherFlyer argues that the platform\u2019s profits should come from services that meet the real needs of the project party rather than huge monetary fees or other grey income.EtherFlyer self-listing program will bring new trend to all industryThe problem of centralization has been exposed for a long time. Asset safety, false trading and market manipulation are unavoidable problems in mechanism. In the aspect of project online, the centralized approach sets up a lot of thresholds, seemingly quality control, but in fact it is the exploitation of the project party, but also the control of investors. Facts also prove that the projects launched under the centralized mechanism are not the best ones. On the contrary, most of them are air projects mainly based on make a profit.Under the influence of relevant interests and the control of human factors, there is no guarantee of fairness, fairness and openness, why can\u2019t all projects be put on the table? Centralization of course is not willing to give up vested interests, but as a decentralised preacher, EtherFlyer must achieve the decentralisation of token launching with the fastest speed and the best quality, and restore the true appearance and healthy state of the industry.
