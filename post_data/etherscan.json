The platform is most commonly used for looking up, confirming and validating transactions that have taken place on the Ethereum Blockchain.The main use of Etherscan for developers, however, is to verify their contract by verifying the bytecode of the smart contract (which is stored in the Ethereum network) corresponds to the Solidity code initially available only to the smart contract developer. This means that getting verified on Etherscan is a quality check on your smart contract, and the code is executed accordingly when the smart contract is executed.The FST Network team believes that it is a good practice to publish your Ethereum Smart Contract code on Etherscan.io under your contract\u2019s address in a main net environment as it represents transparency and signifies readiness of your product. Once deployed, the smart contract will be published on the main net and its code cannot be changed. Because it is no longer a moving target, it becomes easier to audit. However, during our deployment to the main net, we noticed that there are flaws within the etherscan verification framework.So why did we hack Etherscan?FST Network provides modularised functions. What exactly does that mean? In layman\u2019s terms, we use smart contracts to generate smart contracts, and this allows our clients to manage and configure their crypto-assets with smart contracts. Because our modules are built upon \u201cSmart Contracts\u201d rather than a \u201cSmart Contract,\u201d we have a powerful objective-orientation structure to support modularization. On top of that, as a rare benefit of modularization, the relationship of each objective of the code is complex such as \u201ccall\u201d or \u201cinclude.\u201d This makes our modules robust for business applications since the core smart contract is lean. This also makes our end-users free from the bug of adopting features from Ethereum.At FST Network, we take Smart contract security very seriously and formal verification allows us to prove conclusively that certain error states can never occur and our product can deliver what it promised to deliver.How does Etherscan verify smart contracts and what does it check?When verifying the contract, there are two factors that are inspected: 1) compiling time should not exceed 30 seconds and 2) the complexity of the contract.Etherescan will compile the Solidity code and ensure the resulting bytecode exactly matches the bytecode stored in the Ethereum network. With that verification in place, clients who are reading the smart contract will know that the code is being executed accordingly when they execute the smart contract.Our modules involve multiple contracts, and therefore we cannot get verified when Etherscan reads our modules because the compiling time exceeds 30 seconds. Our contracts take approximately 2 minutes to compile.In addition, in order to get verified, Etherscan compiler will generate a meta-hash in compile result (bytecode) according to modern solidity\u2019s nature. This is their method to prove the contract promise meets the Blockchain result. The bytecode generated by Etherscan\u2019s compiler is different in the official compiler \u201csolc\u201d if the contract is complex. Our objective-orientation is larger than usual scale (2500\u20134000 lines with 5\u201310 contracts compared with the normal single contract at 200\u2013500 lines), therefore our meta hash result is different with Etherscan.So how we hacked Etherscan?1. We calculated and replaced the meta hash in the compiled result before deploying to the ethereum chain to make the binary consistent with the compiled version in Etherscan.2. We rewrote the entire contract to non-inheritance format and simplified the logic of our contract. The more abstract the code, the more stability and robustness are sacrificed. We simplified it because, the less effort that is needed to understand and conduct maintenance, the better the ability to extend and elaborate the business logic. In order to verify our smart contract on the Etherscan, we made changed our contract to compile only in low-quality format.3. The max optimization runs is limited to 200 (which is not the optimal number for most of the contract). So, we \u201cadjusted\u201d the limit.What does it mean for Etherscan?From this whole experience, we noticed that the entire framework of Etherscan is designed to verify simple contracts with simple functionalities and is not compliant with the updated version of solidity. This will only bring harm to big projects, as they need to sacrifice features and quality of their code just to get verified on Etherscan. This cannot remain true if we desire that blockchain technology achieve what it needs to achieve \u2014 the revolutionary tech that will redefine the economic and digital structure. Smart contracts will only get more robust, not less. If this problem remains as it is, how can a developer convince others of the execution of the smart contract? We already have too many scams in the market. While open sourcing the code on GitHub is a great idea, it gives no guarantees that the code in the repository is even remotely similar to the one running on-chain.Formal verification allows programmers greater assurances in developing smart contracts. Naturally, any type of security comes at a cost, and we do not need Etherscan to make it any more difficult for the developers.Originally published at www.fstk.io on May 12, 2018.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Tokenization", "Cryptocurrency", "Blockchain"]}, {"title": "Checking your JNT balance on Etherscan", "post_link": "https://medium.com/jibrel-network/checking-your-jnt-balance-on-etherscan-599ebcb4cf3f?source=search_post---------1", "author_name": "Jibrel", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@jibrelnetwork", "publish_date": "2017-12-16", "last_modified_date": "2019-02-07", "readtime": "1.18", "claps": 150, "voters": 32, "content": "Checking your JNT balance on EtherscanUsing Etherscan to read the JNT contract and check your balanceJibrelFollowDec 16, 2017 \u00b7 2 min readWith Jibrel Network Token (JNT) withdrawals enabled for the first time on Friday, December 15th, a lot of people have wondered why they see their token balance in their wallets, but not on Etherscan.

I love Etherscan team and their great works that help encourage the growth of Ethereum community.BackgroundTwo weeks ago my friend sent me this post on Reddit, with holders of ERC20 tokens complaining about spotting some weird transferral history at their accounts, with tokens they have never seen and bought in the past. It caused some fuzz and nervous discussions among people about how to deal with it, and how much does it do harm to their wallets.Reddit post on weird withdrawalWhat you will learnThis article will demonstrate a measure to achieve the similar consequence shown in the aforementioned Reddit post. Eventually, you will acquire the concept and the skill to replicate the trick on Etherscan.ConceptERC20 is simply a token interface standard that is suggested for developers to obey in order to make sure every token on the market have a compatible interface to achieve basic functions, such as transfer and approve.Etherscan does not record the transactions based on whether an exact transferral action has taken place, yet the Transfer Event emitted by the token contract. It is correct! However, what if an ERC20 compatible token contract forge(fake) an event without doing any actual transferral at all?Let\u2019s do some hands-onThe contract code (FakeToken.sol) is as followed:FakeToken.sol referenced from OpenZeppelin\u2019s SimpleToken.solSimply copy over the Openzeppelin\u2019s SimpleToken contract as the base, with an additional fakeTransfer function.By the fakeTransfer function at line 14 to 16, we are able to emit the Transfer Event without doing any transfer. When this fakeTransfer function is triggered on the Ropsten network, you can see there is a transfer recorded by Etherscan on the Ropsten network.Transaction Hash: https://ropsten.etherscan.io/tx/0xa876a2ebe61227eb9e82a796e21e71bf66819493ee52ef69ed06ef803c60a7c3In an extraction of the transaction as followed, we can observe that address 0x0a1e0\u2026 initiates the transaction which transfers 2018 least units of ERC20 (FAK) from some arbitrary address 0xdd989\u2026 to itself.Extraction of fake transferralIf you go into the ERC20 history of 0xdd989\u2026, you will notice that 0xdd989\u2026 NEVER holds an ERC20 (FAK) in the past.No ERC20 inflow at address 0xdd989\u2026Bonus: You can make it a \u201cfake\u201d burn functionfunction fakeBurn(address _sender, uint256 _value) public {    emit Transfer(_sender, address(0), _value);}This is how it\u2019s done. :)SummaryThis fake transferral cannot make an impact if the owner knows that this is bogus. There are two cases that can possibly make it useful:You just want to promote and increase the awareness of your token lolYou want to scare the holders that their tokens have been stolen (by using the exact name as your targetted ERC20 token in the token contract).Response from Etherscan TeamI have mailed Etherscan\u2019s team in advance on this issue before publishing. The followings are their swift response (in 2 days):Hi Jeff,Thanks for writing in and pointing out the SPAM token promo trick.We have a SPAM reputation in place to mark any promotional or deemed SPAM technique that would add unnecessary \"noise\" to Etherscan.As a transaction in the nature you have pointed out is initiated with a gas fee paid, it would be recorded as a transaction and while calling the contract will initiate any function in the contract (including emitting a log). It is unavoidable due to the transaction being \"paid\" for.We could only downplay these \"promotional\" attempt by marking it as SPAM.Once again, thank you for your effort and writing to us.Have a nice day#BUIDL#SHIPITRegards- Etherscan Team [Kav]I totally agree that manually downplaying the SPAMs could be the only effective way, yet I reckon that this trick can still deceive some holders who are unaware of this issue. ;pThank youHope you enjoy the article and have learned some cool skills.I really love Etherscan and wish that this tiny trick can be prevented soon in the near future to avoid misunderstandings. \u2764Github code is here.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Erc20", "Cryptocurrency", "Hacking", "Cybersecurity"]}, {"title":

Every account that held REP was issued REP on the new contract address, 1:1.If you do not see your REP balance on the new contract when viewing your account address on Etherscan, go to the following link, and replace the end (YOUR_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS_HERE) with your account address:https://etherscan.io/token/0x1985365e9f78359a9B6AD760e32412f4a445E862?a=YOUR_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS_HEREThat URL will query your REP balance on the new contract address for your Ether account, cache its balance, and then show the new balance across everywhere else on Etherscan.For more details about the migration, check out the launch post below:Augur LaunchesThe REP migration has been successfully completed.

We\u2019re really excited to show you this in practice!In this post, we\u2019ll be doing a couple of things using the \u201cWrite Contract\u201d feature on Etherscan \u2b07\ufe0fTransferring funds to a wallet of our choiceFilling up the TokenWallet Gas TankYou\u2019ll need a few things to get started \u2b07\ufe0fYour TokenWallet with some ETH loaded inMetamask installed on your browserEtherscan open on your browserConnecting to MetamaskIf you\u2019re a TokenWallet Alpha user and have already deployed your Contract Wallet in the app, getting connected to Metamask takes no time at all. To connect, simply install the Metamask extension to your browser (at metamask.io) and make sure you\u2019re connected to the Ropsten Test Network.To log in, look out for \u201cimport account using seed phrase\u201d \u2014 click this and enter your TokenWallet\u2019s seed phrase. Wondering where to find your TokenWallet\u2019s seed? Head to the \u201cMore (. . .)\u201d tab in the app and tap \u201cBackup Seed\u201d to reveal it.Enter your seed phrase on this screen \u2b06\ufe0fOnce you\u2019ve connected your wallet to Metamask, you should be able to see an ETH balance \u2014 if you\u2019re wondering why this balance is different to the balance on your TokenWallet, that\u2019s because Metamask reads the Gas Tank\u2019s balance, rather than your Contract Wallet. This is super important, as it means that your funds are better protected should your Gas Tank ever be compromised.Go ahead and name your wallet in Metamask \u2014 we called ours \u201cTokenCard #1\u201d \u2014 and you\u2019re good to go.So you\u2019re set up with Metamask and the TokenWallet \u2014 what\u2019s next? We\u2019re going to make use of Etherscan\u2019s \u201cWrite Contract\u201d feature to send some ETH!Metamask wallet and TokenWallet side-by-side \u2b06\ufe0fGetting started with EtherscanOpen up a new window and head to ropsten.etherscan.io, the version of Etherscan on the Ropsten test network. The first thing you\u2019ll need to do is grab your wallet address from the app (highlighted below) and paste this into the search bar on Etherscan \u2014 this will load up the info on your TokenWallet.In the example below, we\u2019re using a newly deployed wallet, so we\u2019ve got a blank canvas to play with. Before that, here\u2019s a quick intro to some of the tabs on Etherscan:Code: This is where you can view your Smart Contract source code \u2014 we\u2019ve published and verified ours on Etherscan for you to check out.Read Contract: This is where you\u2019ll be able to query your Contract Wallet, checking for example if you have a certain address whitelisted.Write Contract \u1d2e\u1d49\u1d57\u1d43: This is where you\u2019ll be able to execute transactions on your TokenWallet, for example topping up your Gas Tank. We\u2019ll be using this today\u2026Viewing your wallet in Etherscan \u2b06\ufe0fSend ETH to another walletLet\u2019s get started by sending ETH from our wallet to another wallet! To do this, head to the Write Contract tab on Etherscan.You\u2019ll need to click \u201cConnect with Metamask\u201d in order to authorise transactions (safety first!) \u2014 we logged in earlier, so all we need to do is confirm that we\u2019re happy to execute transactions.Connecting Etherscan to Metamask \u2b06\ufe0fFrom there, head to Transfer \u2014 this is the name given to sending ETH through your TokenWallet \u2014 and fill in the details of your transaction:_to: The address of the wallet you\u2019d like to send ETH to._asset: As we\u2019re sending ETH, we\u2019ve put \u201c0x0\u201d into here._amount: How much ETH you\u2019d like to send. Etherscan requires that you input the value in Wei, which is the smallest denomination of ETH \u2014 sending 1 ETH would mean that we\u2019d need to type in 1000000000000000000.Once you\u2019ve written in the values of your choice, click \u201cWrite\u201d, and that\u2019s it! You\u2019ve just sent ETH from one address to another without needing to use your TokenWallet app. Even better, you\u2019ll still be able to see the transaction in the \u201cTransactions\u201d tab in the app.Writing your first transaction \ud83c\udf89Topping up your Gas TankNow that you\u2019ve sent some ETH, next up is topping up your TokenWallet Gas Tank.In the same way as sending ETH to a wallet, head to the \u201cWrite Contract\u201d tab on Etherscan, and this time scroll down to InitializeTopUpLimit. Enter how much you\u2019d like to top up your Gas Tank in the _amount section (again, in Wei), then confirm this.Topping up your Gas Tank \u2b06\ufe0fWait a few seconds for the transaction to go through\u2026 and\u2026 that\u2019s it!You\u2019ll be able to see your top-up transaction reflected both in the Transactions screen on Etherscan and \u2014 if you pull down in the app to refresh \u2014 on the actual balance of your Gas Tank in the TokenWallet!Your newly updated Gas Tank \u2b06\ufe0fSo there you are; just a few ways in which you can interact with your TokenWallet on using tools such as Etherscan and Metamask!

This did not result in damage to the platform or private information being leaked. If anything, it highlighted a security issue within the site.Our privacy expert, Dylan Curran reviews and highlights the pertinent parts of the Etherscan privacy policy so you know what you need to know.TYPES OF DATA WE COLLECTIt may include (but is not limited to):Personal information that links back to an individual, e.g. name, gender, date of birth, and other personal identification numbers;Contact information, e.g. address, phone number, email address;Technical information, e.g. IP address for API services and login;Statistical data, e.g. hits to website.To summarize the \u2018Types of Data Collected\u2019 section, Curran points out: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing too dramatic going on here, and it appears that they only collect any relevant information about you when you sign up. The good thing about Etherscan, is that you don\u2019t need to sign up to the service in order to use it effectively, and it seems they don\u2019t collect your searches or queries regarding any browsing you do of the blockchain.\u201d So it is possible to use this service without submitting your data. A win for all privacy-conscious people.HOW DO WE COLLECT PERSONAL DATAEtherscan collects data under fairly standard circumstances. Here is the privacy policy section as it pertains directly to your data that they collect:When you engage with our products and services;When you create an account with us;Communications with them via telephone, letter, fax, and email;When you visit their website;When you contact them in person;When they contact you in person;When they collect information about you via third parties, and other channels including their support helpdesk.\u201cThe only worrying thing here,\u201d Curran points out, \u201cis that they collect information about you via third parties, as Etherscan actually uses Google Analytics and Doubleclick, both services that provide analytical advertising services to millions of other websites.\u201dCurran then goes on to explain what portion of the analytical services Etherscan is using from these third-parties. \u201c Etherscan only seems to be using the analytical side, and not the advertising side of things.\u201d And points out how you can best protect yourself: \u201cThis means they are not necessarily exploiting your blockchain activities for advertising. It is good to keep this in mind though and use a tracker-blocker such as Ghostery if you can.\u201dTO WHOM DO WE DISCLOSE YOUR PERSONAL DATAEtherscan states they \u2018will not trade or sell your Personal Data to third parties. Your Personal Data shall only be disclosed or transferred to the following third parties appointed or authorised by the Company for the fulfilment of the Purpose of: (a) data warehouses; (b) IT service providers; \u00a9 data analytics and/or marketing agency; (d) legal bodies as permitted or required by law such as in compliance with a warrant or subpoena issued by a court of competent jurisdiction; and/or (e) regulatory authorities applicable to you; and/or (f) safety and security personnel.\u2019Etherscan seems to use this information in a similar fashion to other platforms. Curran does not seem to be worried about improper use of your personal data by Etherscan.CURRAN\u2019S VERDICT\u201cEtherscan is a blockchain service, and because of this they need to adhere to strict privacy standards. The positives are that they are not really collecting any information about what you do on the site, and they definitely aren\u2019t collecting any personal information about you unless you sign up to the service, which you don\u2019t need to do.\u201d\u201cHowever,\u201d Curran continues, \u201cI do have to dock a point for their use of Google Analytics and Doubleclick, two companies I definitely don\u2019t trust with ANY information whatsoever. For these reasons, I give them a 4/5 star rating, and I encourage you to use a VPN/tracker blocker when using this service,\u201d Curran concludes.\u201cThank you for watching the video, we make these privacy reviews so you don\u2019t have to read the policies yourself.

This is a truly important milestone for team TTC as we believe that accessibility is one of the main factors for a successful token project. By being registered on these platforms, anyone can search and obtain the information regarding TTC tokens, publicly and transparently.TTC on CoinMarketCapTTC on Etherscan.ioAs many of you already know, CoinMarketCap and Etherscan both have played very important and significant roles in developing the blockchain industry. Here are brief introductions on both platforms.CoinMarketCapCoinMarketCap is a website for tracking capitalization of various cryptocurrencies. It provides a summary of all price related information for each cryptocurrency listed. Meaning, it is a convenient tool for all crypto enthusiasts to view their token of interest.As of August 17th, 2018, there are 1,855 cryptocurrencies listed on Coinmarketcap. Because Coinmarketcap provides the current price, the market capitalization and volume data for every cryptocurrency, as well as historical data and charts, it has more than 100 million monthly page visits.EtherscanEtherscan is the BlockExplorer for the Ethereum Blockchain. Just like any BlockExplorer, Etherscan is a search engine that allows users to lookup, confirm and validate transactions, but only those on the Ethereum Blockchain.Though a BlockExplorer for the Ethereum blockchain, Etherscan is independent of the Ethereum Foundation. It is independently operated and developed by a small team of people that are passionate about decentralized information and infrastructure.The reason many people use Etherscan is because it makes it extremely easy for Ethereum or ERC token holders to check their transaction history. It allows everyone to easily check the wallet balance of their own, and even others.If you have any questions, please reach us through our email, telegram channel, or other social media pages listed below.\u2014 Team TTCAbout TTCTTC is a blockchain fit for mass adoption and a sustainable token economy model.

The resulting number is your token balance on IDEX.We hope that helps. If you ever have any questions please visit our 24/7 support on Telegram found in the link below.

DGX 2.0DigixFollowAug 23, 2016 \u00b7 2 min readPartnership with EtherScanEtherScan will work with Digix to facilitate the recording of asset transaction history for DigixGlobals\u2019s digital assets, specifically, DGX / POA Asset Cards / DGDs.This step forward symbolizes 2 very important things for the Ethereum community:DApps can purely focus on their core business and synergise with other Dapps on the Ethereum Super-ComputerAs we progressed with software development, we were looking for an accurate and efficient solution to publish transaction histories of Digix assets in real (block) time. This was where the issue of chain reorganization came about as a potential blocker / delay to our developmental progress.Chain reorganization is a phenomenon that happens frequently (every few minutes), where the UI state of transactions for the latest blocks may not be accurate and updates to the UI data is needed (if we were to serve them on our client in real time) at the resolution of the fork. This could affect the overall user experience if an update and republishing of block data is required continually in the front end to accurately reflect asset transaction history. Transaction states can be classified as Unconfirmed, X confirms / Fully confirmed / failed etc. In short, it takes up computer resources (gas and response time) to collate and fully reflect the correct history on the blockchain in Digix\u2019s hosted wallet.An in house implementation for transaction states to be served to the UI would be doable, but this is where Etherscan has provided their expertise in this area. Etherscan provides one of the best block explorers for the Ethereum blockchain. They have made front end publishing of accurate, transaction history and states for the Ethereum blockchain one of the core strengths of their business, efficiently dealing with the chain reorganization issue.So why is this significant?Instead of us spending extra resources to replicate what EtherScan does perfectly well, we are able to integrate with them (simply because we are all developing on the Ethereum supercomputer) that has made our software development easier.2. Transparency of Dapp\u2019s transaction historyEtherscan also plays the role of an independent third party that collates all transaction history that occurs with DGX and DGDs on the Ethereum Blockchain, and then publishing the results of all its history on their website. Having Etherscan feed this information to our users, instead of Digix doing so is also another added assurance that none of the transaction history / state has been manipulated or tampered with prior to publishing it to the front end UI.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Blockchain"]}, {"title": "On June 11, we held a session \u2018\u2019#3 Building a Toy Version of Etherscan in an Hour\u2019\u2019", "post_link": "https://medium.com/icovo/on-june-11-we-held-a-session-3-building-a-toy-version-of-etherscan-in-an-hour-896893640fbe?source=search_post", "author_name": "ICOVO AG", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@harunatanaka", "publish_date": "2018-06-21", "last_modified_date": "2018-08-08", "readtime": "1.73", "claps": 50, "voters": 1, "content": "On June 11, we held a session \u2018\u2019#3 Building a Toy Version of Etherscan in an Hour\u2019\u2019ICOVO AGFollowJun 21, 2018 \u00b7 2 min readICOVO hold studying sessions \u201cEthereum Hack Tokyo\u201d every month in Tokyo to support engineers\u2019 blockchain related startups.

So, I took a bite and emailed them.Down we go!They wanted transaction hashes to prove I lost the ETH I claimed to have lost, so I went to https://etherscamdb.info/, searched up a few known trust-trading scam addresses, and found some transactions that came from the Binance hot wallets.The initial correspondenceThis is where it got interesting. They said that they forwarded my email, but the email address that they forwarded it to belongs to a MyEtherWallet phishing site that we recently caught and indexed on EtherScamDB \u2014 https://etherscamdb.info/domain/token-emrify.com.They requested I continue to chat to them with a different email provider as Sharklasers isn\u2019t too secure/privacy-minded. I did as they requested and moved over to ProtonMail.So I continued the conversation by sending them the random transaction hashes I found earlier and they emailed back.Sending them the fake tx hashesTheir nonsensical responseThe tactic of throwing random jargon out there to confuse the reader is pretty commonplace in these types of email phishing campaigns. I continued to email even though their response didn\u2019t really make sense.So the story continued and they wanted me to obtain a fresh address that I would receive my 2ETH to. It would be sent from their smart contract that is supposed to recover ETH from trust trading scam site addresses. I\u2019ve hit the jackpot!Hook, line, and there\u2019s the sinkerAfter some time, their smart contract was \u201cready\u201d and all I had to do was go to this link\u2026 except this link took me to a MyEtherWallet clone \u2014 one that looked very similar to a recently-flagged phishing domain: https://etherscamdb.info/domain/token-emrify.comAnalytics capturing clicks to this specific phishing siteThis illustrates that I\u2019m not the first to be sent this site \u2014 around 71 other people have been emailed the same bullshit and possibly fallen victim. The website leaves a few clues as to how we can find the identity of these guys.Their contract address, funded with ETH as promised, is 0xbde430F54A63016D8A5F31F243761653728086A2 \u2014 funded with a Binance account, as well as another UCA \u2014 0xb3792b871808e724132efff38375e056a9da7b21 \u2014 which is also funded by a Bittrex account. Both of these exchanges employ KYC/AML routines, but of course it\u2019s totally possible that these addresses do not belong to the bad actors and they just found a random address with ETH in it.Anyway, I loaded up my VPN, logged into my proxychain, created a fresh throwaway 0x address, and did as they said.Turns out that it is the same scripts running the recently flagged https://etherscamdb.info/domain/token-emrify.com \u2014 even down to POST /demoj.php with the 302 redirect to /tokenn.html page.So, how can I stay protected?Never reach out to someone offering off-site help/support. If you do, always create/use a temporary email address \u2014 you do not want to open yourself up to phishing attacks by these guys from your favorite exchanges!Be vigilant and always read communications carefully. Try to understand the jargon they are throwing around and see if it makes sense.If something seems to be too good to be true, it probably is.Never comply and use url shorteners especially in the cryptocurrency world.You can always expand a bit.ly or goo.gl link by putting a + at the end and it will give you the statistics and destination address (example: https://bitly.com/2Mo5i5F+)Never input your private keys into a domain that was sent to you \u2014 even if the interface looks familiar.MyCrypto has a desktop application that you can use as your primary interface that you can verify builds with: https://medium.com/mycrypto/mycrypto-launches-desktop-applications-w-hardware-wallet-support-efac86c962a8Ask the people if something seems suspicious.

We will be looking to send out in the future Signals that cover snapshots of our business and DGD governance updates, so do add DGX and DGD to your Blockfolio portfolios if you have not in order to receive updates from us.If you haven\u2019t already, please download the Blockfolio app from the Google Playstore or Apple iOS Store.2. CoinMarketCapDGX is also now listed on CMC at https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/digix-gold-token/.We note that the figures above are missing the total circulating supply of DGX and are working on getting the figures displayed correctly.3.

Shaun sat alongside Dorjee Sun, founder and CEO of Perlin, (also Executive Advisor to Republic Protocol), Tiago Alves, VP For AppCoins, moderated by Lee-On, Founder of Crypto-Square. The panel discussed on Life after ICO, where topics such as the importance of treasury management by means of DGX, marketing, community engagement, featured amongst the speakers.TechInAsia2018Ethereum Singapore has seen lively activity and we at Digix are always proud to be helping projects, whether established or new, reach out to their community and enthusiasts.Zilliqa is hosting their status and progress meetup on 23 May: https://www.meetup.com/Ethereum-Singapore/events/249733843/We have also secured the famous Miss Bitcoin for a joint event (co-hosted with XSQ). She has been the face of Bitcoin in Japan since 2011, establishing her name as one of the most impressive crypto-influencer: https://www.meetup.com/Ethereum-Singapore/events/250959127/The last meetup of the week will be by Quadrant Protocol (https://quadrantprotocol.com): https://www.meetup.com/Ethereum-Singapore/events/250766318/If you are in Singapore, we hope to see you at these meetups!Upcoming plansSince the launch of DGX 2.0, our numbers so far have looked optimistic and we are grateful to our community for their support. As we get into the groove of things, we are looking to roll out various plans in the short term with a view to scaling, putting out a consistent brand strategy and increasing our outreach.Brand identity refreshIn this quarter, we will be finalising our rebranding. Our community can expect to see our new brand identity implemented for all our existing collateral and outreach platforms. These include, amongst many others, a new website and a new logo. Do stay tuned for more updates in this space \u2014 we expect our brand identity refresh to be complete by end June 2018.Continuing substantial propagation of DGX in the ecosystemRight now, we are focusing on increasing the reach of DGX in the ecosystem, first by targeting decentralised exchanges (DEXes). We have done our listing and integration with Kyber Network as the 1st DEX, and the flows on Kyber have been consistent and optimistic.Next, we are working with the Maker team for a smooth integration and listing on their Oasis DEX. We are also working with Tokenlon from imToken on integration aspects for the 0x protocol.Long termAchieving substantial entrenchment of DGX in the ecosystemIn the long term, our goal is to establish DGX as the de facto gold token reserve on the blockchain. While noting that there are various other projects in the same space, we strive to differentiate ourselves on the basis of a technology that is strong in substance and defensible in execution.In time to come, we believe that asset tokenisation will prove to be one of the primary use cases on the blockchain and we are proud to be one of the pioneers on this front. The Proof of Provenance protocol that we have developed remains the key demonstration of what we seek to achieve in this space: to have a fully auditable and transparent asset-backed token that cannot be undermined by the insertion of unplanned elements (such as fraud, etc) at various entry points, that is problematic in traditional circles.We will continue to integrate DGX with all partnering dApps and update the community as and when these can be finalised.At the same time, we want to increase community engagement with the DGD token, believing that a self motivated, self organising and self governing community that is united by a broader purpose and goal in mind has more potential and power than a strict rules-based system that has seen disenfranchisement of stakeholders, alienation of minorities and abuse of power from within. To achieve this, we are constantly working on and ironing out our DGD governance structure.These remain the key tenets of our ecosystem and to that, we continue to work hard in the hopes of developing a defensible structure and constantly innovating to figure out where we can add value to the ecosystem.We always appreciate feedback from the community on any angles, so do drop us a note or join our channels below:Medium: https://medium.com/@DigixReddit: http://reddit.com/r/digixTwitter: https://twitter.com/digixglobalFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/digixglobal/Github: https://github.com/digixglobalTelegram: https://t.me/digixofficialDiscord: https://discord.gg/CCDBJJC", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Ethereum", "Digix", "Gold"]}, {"title": "\ud83d\udd31Our PRE-SALE is LIVE NOW !\ud83d\udd31", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@MobileTokenBank/our-pre-sale-is-live-now-bc49f78bfa18?source=search_post", "author_name": "GORDON JACK", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@MobileTokenBank", "publish_date": "2018-11-06", "last_modified_date": "2018-11-08", "readtime": "1.23", "claps": 179, "voters": 10, "content": "\ud83d\udd31Our PRE-SALE is LIVE NOW !\ud83d\udd31GORDON JACKFollowNov 6, 2018 \u00b7 2 min read\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89 Welcome to the MobileTokenBank world !\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89https://etherscan.io/token/0xd9bfbbf1d00ddc466afc6c4fa779aa4bc3c4815c\ud83c\udf08The Mobile Token Bank(MTB) aims to spread the word of IEO around the world to solve the problems of ICO in the current block chain market\ud83c\udf08\u201cthe Mobile Token Bank will establish the correct and sound ICO culture in order to remedy the persistent problems of ICO.

I\u2019m all about the transparency too and have heard there has been some fudging around with numbers involved in the project.Your numbers \u2014 did you get them from their smart contract via EtherScan or another block explorer? I\u2019m assuming so.I did not register to contribute to this project so I am unfamiliar with the registration/contribution process, but it sounds very possible they were accepting fiat too \u2014 not just Ethereum.If that\u2019s true, then it\u2019s possible the numbers they mentioned were correct. They did a lot of advertising so it\u2019s possible they weren\u2019t just targeting the crypto niche. Yeah, crypto investors have ETH on-hand, but there are far more people out there with fiat in the bank that are comfortable investing in startups.Not trying to back them up or anything on potentially fudging the numbers, but it\u2019s possible they took alternative forms of capital \u2014 specially for the $10,000+ tier I saw on their site.There\u2019s a great chance that\u2019s a fiat-to-fiat bank transfer going to Civil:\u2019s designated bank account. Remember, we\u2019re merging with traditional capital markets so we need to be open-minded to the alternative processes that have existed far longer in that space than the norms of crypto we know today.", "responses": 1, "tags": ["Crypto", "Blockchain", "Investing", "Blockchain Startup", "Ethereum Blockchain"]}, {"title": "CHP Tokens Explained: What They Are and Why You Need Them to Play on CoinPoker", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@CoinPoker/chp-tokens-explained-what-they-are-and-why-you-need-them-to-play-on-coinpoker-6fa47266f601?source=search_post", "author_name": "CoinPoker", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@CoinPoker", "publish_date": "2018-06-29", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-29", "readtime": "2.80", "claps": 5, "voters": 2, "content": "CHP Tokens Explained: What They Are and Why You Need Them to Play on CoinPokerCoinPokerFollowJun 29, 2018 \u00b7 3 min readIf you\u2019re new to CoinPoker, or you are a long-time player curious about the cryptocurrency that powers your bets, you\u2019re probably wondering CHP is. This guide will help you understand what CHP tokens are, what you can do with them, and what their benefits are for you as a player.CHP (Chips) is an ERC-20 token that is used on CoinPoker for all bets and payments made to and from your account. It is essentially a cryptocurrency, that can be purchased on a number of exchanges and held on ERC-20 compatible wallets.Wait, What is an ERC-20 Token?ERC-20 tokens are a type of crypto asset built on the Ethereum (ETH) network. ERC stands for Ethereum Request for Comment, meaning that CHP transfers are powered by Ethereum Smart Contracts.Every time they are transferred from one wallet to another, or from an exchange\u2019s wallet for that matter, an Ethereum Smart Contract is made between parties, and verified by proof of stake on the ETH blockchain. A great video by YouTuber, Simply Explained, breaks the concept down for crypto-newbies here:REMINDER: You should never transfer CHP to CoinPoker directly from an exchange.Here\u2019s why:In order for us to allocate funds to the right Coinpoker account, we need them to be sent from the account\u2019s verified wallet. When you transfer from an exchange, the deposit is done from the exchange\u2019s wallet that pools the resources of hundreds of other accounts \u2014 meaning there\u2019s no way for us to verify that its from you!The Benefits of Using CHP on CoinPokerOne of the key advantages of CoinPoker compared to traditional platforms is that it eliminates the lack of transparency in traditional poker room transactions, and simplifies deposits and withdrawals.Traditional poker rooms have lengthy and mysterious deposit and withdrawal procedures, and it is impossible for players to verify or check if a transaction is on its way.The use of ETH Smart Contracts makes CHP transfers public, as long as you have your public address (or that of anyone else) you can track and verify if payments were made. CHP tokens also make it possible for payments to be processed incredibly quickly, the speed depending on two factors:Speed of the Ethereum Network: Depending on maintenance issues or congestion, CHP transaction speed is subject to delays in line with those on the ETH network.Amount of Gwei Used for the Transaction: Gwei (or gas) is what powers blockchain transactions, and for CHP transactions make sure you select 41.

For the moment you can easily trade BTC or ETH for CHP on the following platforms. Note that you need to purchase these major coins before purchasing CHP tokens:KuCoin (Guide: How to Buy CHP on KuCoin)AllCoinHitBTCForkDeltaYoBitRecommended Crypto Wallets for CHP HoldersIf it\u2019s your first time purchasing cryptocurrencies it is important that you get yourself a reliable and secure crypto wallet. CHP is an ERC-20 token, meaning you need a wallet that enables you to store these types of tokens.Luckily there are plenty of options that not only support ERC-20 tokens, but plenty of other tokens and crypto assets.

Change \u201ccontractVerify\u201d to \u201ccontractVerify2\u201d in your url.Fill in the correct valuesNext up, you\u2019ll need to fill in the correct values in the form. Enter the contract name you wish to verify. Choose the correct compiler. You can find the correct compiler by opening a new terminal and entering the following command.solc \u2014 versionThe result will most likely be a non-nightly build.The correct value for Runs, which is the amount of times the optimization should run, is either 0 or 200, depending on your truffle version. With newer versions, we recommend trying with 200 first.Paste the contents of your contracts in the code box. Keep the code as it was when you deployed it, but remove all the imports, as all code will be in a single file, so importing will not be necessary or supported.Tip: We recommend using this tool to flatten your code. What oracles-combine-solidity does it get your contract code, import every contract your contract uses and flatten it all into one file. It will make your life a lot easier.If you deployed a contract which contained constructor arguments, you\u2019ll need to add them in the following input box. Constructor arguments are expected to be ABI-encoded. More information on ABI-encoding can be found on the page, but remember arguments are _right to left_. An example for one of our projects can be found below.Tip: If you can\u2019t figure out your ABI-encoded constructor arguments, first look at the encoded unlinked binary of your contract, then look at the encoded transaction-arguments of the transaction that created your contract. If your contract was deployed with constructor arguments, they should have been appended to the transaction data. So the difference between the two will be the ABI-encoded constructor arguments.Lastly, you\u2019ll need to add any libraries you\u2019re using. You can find the location of your Libraries in the output of Truffle when you deployed them or in the generated json files.That\u2019s it, hit verify and publish. Your contract should now be verified. Your code should be visible on your contract and methods for reading the state of your contract will be available on the web page.Why verify your contracts?The reason we always verify our contracts is easy. First of all, it generates trust. People can see your contracts and verify the code with what you claim they should be doing.Secondly, it\u2019s darn useful to have an easy go-to page to read the state of your contracts.Get to Know FundRequestWebsite | Sign up | White paper | Progress reportsNever Miss An Update By Following FundRequest\u2019s ChannelsBlog | Telegram | Github | Reddit | TwitterOur partners", "responses": 5, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Solidity", "Development", "Etherscan", "Articles"]}, {"title": "\u5982\u4f55\u5efa\u7acb Etherscan \u670d\u52d9", "post_link": "https://medium.com/getamis/%E5%A6%82%E4%BD%95%E5%BB%BA%E7%AB%8B-etherscan-%E6%9C%8D%E5%8B%99-c79c847ec4f?source=search_post", "author_name": "Zih-Ci Lin", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@zihcilin", "publish_date": "2018-06-19", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-20", "readtime": "6.45", "claps": 908, "voters": 29, "content": "\u5982\u4f55\u5efa\u7acb Etherscan \u670d\u52d9Zih-Ci LinFollowJun 19, 2018 \u00b7 7 min read\u52d5\u6a5f\u9019\u7bc7\u6587\u7ae0\u6211\u5011\u5c07\u5206\u4eab\u5982\u679c\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u500b\u985e\u4f3c Etherscan \u7684\u670d\u52d9\uff0c\u8a72\u5982\u4f55\u63d0\u4f9b\u76f8\u95dc API\u3002\u9996\u5148\u5b9a\u7fa9\u4e00\u4e0b\u6211\u5011\u7684 API \u9700\u6c42\uff1a\u900f\u904e hash \u53d6\u5f97 blocks/transactions\u900f\u904e block number \u53d6\u5f97 Ether/ERC20 balance\u76ee\u524d\u6211\u5011\u7684\u5be6\u4f5c\u662f\u57fa\u65bc\u76ee\u524d Ethereum \u6700\u6d41\u884c\u7684\u5ba2\u6236\u7aef\u4e4b\u4e00 geth \u4fee\u6539\u3002\u95dc\u65bc\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u5167\u5bb9\u6216\u5be6\u4f5c\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u53c3\u8003 AMIS \u7684 eth-indexer \u5c08\u6848https://github.com/getamis/eth-indexer\u82e5\u60a8\u6709\u76f8\u95dc\u554f\u984c\u6216\u5efa\u8b70\uff0c\u6b61\u8fce\u8207\u6211\u5011\u5206\u4eab\u8a0e\u8ad6\uff01ConfigurationGeth 1.8 \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86 initial state pruning.In reality almost nobody cares about historical data \u2014 as long as it can be recomputed \u2014 rather only about the recent state of the network.\u5be6\u969b\u4e0a\u5982\u679c\u8cc7\u6599\u80fd\u5920\u88ab\u91cd\u65b0\u8a08\u7b97\u4e14\u9084\u539f\uff0c\u591a\u6578\u4eba\u6bd4\u8d77\u6b77\u53f2\u8cc7\u6599\u5247\u66f4\u5728\u610f\u8fd1\u671f\u8cc7\u6599\u3002\u7531\u65bc\u5728 eth-indexer \u7684\u8a2d\u8a08\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u60f3\u8981\u93e1\u50cf\u6240\u6709\u93c8\u4e0a\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u6b77\u53f2\u8cc7\u6599\uff0c\u6545\u9700\u8981\u4fee\u6539 geth \u7684\u5169\u500b\u8a2d\u5b9a\uff1a\u7bc0\u9ede\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u7bc0\u9ede\u8655\u7406\u8cc7\u6599\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002Trie pruning is enabled on all --syncmode variations (including --syncmode=full).

They are extremely useful tools for checking on the state of the network, individual transfers, contract calls and more. Many also provide details around tokens.These services are all free to use, which shouldn\u2019t be underestimated, considering the time and expense it takes to maintain and develop. For the last few months, every day, there are 500,000+ transactions on Ethereum. These are all logged by block explorers, and fed back to you in a (relatively) easy to digest format.But which one should you be using? Let\u2019s explore the options.__________________________________________________________EtherscanThe original and overall best block explorer for Ethereum. You can check pretty much anything, diving deep into mined blocks, transactions and addresses. It\u2019s got a load of other cool tools like checkers for gas, nodes and DEXs, along with some interesting charts & stats.It\u2019s very easy to see what has been coming in and out an address, and for each transaction you can check status (in real time), block height, gas stats, tx cost, etc.They also have a comprehensive token list (covering both ERC-20 & ERC-721), where you can see the various assets that have been launched on Ethereum, and dig into details like top holders, price history, volume, circulating supply, ICO info, exchanges, etc.While Etherscan is awesome, and for many will be the go-to tool, it\u2019s nice to have some alternatives that do a few different things, or present the information in a different or simplified way. In no particular order, here 10 other sites that I like.__________________________________________________________The Old HandsA couple of explorers have been around almost as long as EtherscanEthplorerBuilt by the Everex team, who seem to have their fingers in a few pies. They also have a wallet (who doesn\u2019t these days\u2026) and seem to be messing around with blockchain powered money transfers.One nice feature of Ethplorer is a chart that tracks the $ price of your address balance, and also shows transfer volume.Ethplorer also has a solid focus on tokens, and you can find most of the key information (although they lack descriptions and links). It\u2019s easy to see at see at a glance the token balance in your address, as well as the price fluctuations.Every token has a profile, where you can check the \u2018pulse\u2019, which reveals the price as well as onchain \u2018operations\u2019 (transaction count).EtherchainVery similar to Etherscan, with a slightly more appealing interface. It\u2019s got a lot of similar charts and tools (one unique thing I noticed was the Unit Converter, useful if you\u2019ve ever wondered about the difference between a WEI, Szabo or Finney)The address overview is compact and gives you all the required info, and it\u2019s very easy to see what you have sent and received over time (displayed in chart form as well, by clicking on \u2018History\u2019 tab).A major feature that is lacking is the token explorer. Input a token address and you will not get anything useful.___________________________________________________________New kids on the Block.These projects have popped up in the last few monthsBlockscoutBuilt by the POA Network team, who saw the need for an open source block explorer. A very cool bit of infrastructure that can be examined and utilized from their GitHub. Their ultimate goal is to cover everything on Ethereum, from transactions and block information, token values to sidechains and private chains.The address interface has everything you would expect to see, and identifies clearly between transactions, token transfers, contract calls, and so on, which is very useful and lacking in most other explorers.The token explorer is however very limited and not pulling through recent transfers, but as a note informs, the chain is still being indexed, so I hope this aspect will be improved over time.EnjinXA very fast and nice looking explorer that was only released in December 2018 by the EnjinCoin team. It not only supports Ethereum (along with ERC-20, 721 & 1155 tokens), but also Bitcoin and Litecoin.The address interface crams a lot into a tabular format, which might be a bit crowded for some. However, the key info is all clearly displayed, with token transfers separated into its own tab.The token explorer covers basic details, holders and transfers.In my opinion, EnjinX can boast the best looking ranking by marketcap of over 1000 ERC-20 tokens. However, it\u2019s a shame that it doesn\u2019t also let you rank by onchain activity or number of holders._______________________________________________________________Multichain Explorers.Originally built as block explorers for Bitcoin, these services have diversified to include Ethereum.Blockchain.comRather basic, shows what has been sent and received, so good for quick checks.BTC.comAgain, covers the basics of Ins and Outs, but nothing much to dig into. Nice colourful representation of token holdings, and has a functional token explorer.______________________________________________________________Down the Rabbithole.These services offer something a little bit different.BloxyThis is one serious piece of kit. If it\u2019s happening on Ethereum, Bloxy is intent on letting you know about it. For simply checking transactions, it\u2019s a bit of overkill, and quite confusing when you first fire it up. However, if you want to see everything that is going on within your address, this is where you need to go.Some features:Sent + ReceivedActivities by month graphCalls to smart contractsRelations with other addressesPortfolio analysisNotificationsBloxy also has you covered for comprehensive analysis of of tokens. I could write another long post about all the things that you could find out around individual and grouped tokens, but as an overview of features:Onchain activities (daily + monthly graphs)TransfersContract callsHolders (distributions, historical growth, owner intersection with other tokens)DEX tradesBloxy covers ERC-20, 721, 223 + 827. While you can see the most transferred tokens at a glance, I don\u2019t find this especially useful, as most are shitcoins I\u2019ve never heard of. I\u2019d much rather see a list by marketcap or unique senders, as (in my opinion) this gives a better indication of interesting projects.A couple more things. Great API, and very cool Analytical Reports.Amber DataQuite similar to Bloxy, in that you can access a some intriguing data around transactions and tokens. It also lists ERC-721 collectibles in an appealingly visual way, and reminded me of some I\u2019d forgotten about.However, overall Amber Data feels a bit limited, and the interface is confusing. For example, while it\u2019s easy to see what\u2019s been sent and received, you can only view a graph of account history for 30 days, and \u2018No Addresses were found\u2019 for Incoming Volume by Address.The token view has some nice graphs (especially Incoming Volume by Address), but again limited to only 30 days. The Contract Activity and Adoption & Usage graphs I do not find especially useful, due to the confusing terms that are poorly defined (eg. EOA to Contract Transactions or Unique Address Interactions).Lastly, the token list seems wildly inaccurate, especially when considering marketcap. According to this, VERI and something I\u2019ve never heard of called XCEL have higher markecaps than BNB and MKR \u2014 something\u2019s gone wrong here!EthtectiveA very interesting way to visualize Ethereum network, that makes exploring transfers much more interactive.It\u2019s quite easy to get lost in the maze of transfers and connections, but nonetheless a cool tool for seeing how active an address is, and where the larger transactions are heading to and from.A nice touch is the categorization of addresses, so you can easily identify whales, small fish, exchanges, scams, etc.ETHStatsSprung out of Alethio data studios (which is one of the major Consensys projects), this explorer takes some getting used, but once you do it\u2019s seriously cool and very beautiful to look at.The address interface shows you the value of your portfolio, with distribution of ETH and tokens, charting the rise and fall over time.Of course you can dive deeper into the transactions, and it even visualizes where in the block your transaction fell.While you can search token addresses, and get an overview of the activity, there isn\u2019t a dedicated token explorer per se. But I don\u2019t think Alethio will be resting on their laurels, so I\u2019d expect to see a token explorer before too long.____________________________________________________________So there you have it. Some alternatives to Etherscan. Let me know what your preference is?Also, if token exploration is your thing, I\u2019ve been working on Trivial, attempting to provide information and insights into ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum.", "responses": 3, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Ethereum", "Cryptocurrency", "Technology", "Crypto"]}, {"title": "Exploiting the interface of Etherscan for Ethereum attacks", "post_link": "https://medium.com/quantstamp/exploiting-the-interface-of-etherscan-for-ethereum-attacks-17b72d2897e0?source=search_post", "author_name": "Martin Derka", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@martinderka", "publish_date": "2018-07-19", "last_modified_date": "2018-07-20", "readtime": "9.73", "claps": 420, "voters": 25, "content": "Exploiting the interface of Etherscan for Ethereum attacksMartin DerkaFollowJul 19, 2018 \u00b7 10 min readLast weekend, my hometown was going through a major heatwave. When I woke up on Saturday, I stepped outside onto my deck and immediately realized that this is not a day for outdoor activities, except for perhaps going to a beach. I walked back inside and started thinking about a pleasant way of spending my time in the comfort of my air conditioned living room. I looked at the Game of Thrones book on my desk, but did not feel like reading about more of my favourite characters dying. While this is not the kind of reading that usually I do for pleasure, I decided to browse the blockchain. I opened Etherscan and started browsing through source codes of contracts deployed in the past week. I was not looking for a specific type of contract; I was just curious. I found some ICOs, several games, and then ran into this contract that caught my interest.It appears to be a game where someone, presumably the contract owner, asks a question. If a player guesses the correct answer, they receive the contract\u2019s balance as a reward. When I found the contract, it was holding a balance of approximately 1.03 Ether. Fishy, right?Figure 1: The status of the contract when found.By analyzing the code, we can immediately spot a few odd things. My first impression was that this contract must have been implemented by a beginner developer who is just getting into the Solidity and Ethereum space. However, after proper investigation, it turned out to be a carefully composed piece of code that only pretends to be naive. Let us have a look at everything that is going on here.Figure 2: The source code of the contract.The contract uses Solidity compiler of version 0.4.20 and above. Given that 0.4.25 just came out, it appears to be a bit old. Furthermore, it declares the version as \u201cat least\u201d (using the ^ character). This construct is valid for implementing interfaces and library contracts that are reused in other projects, but smart contracts deployed to the blockchain should fix a single version of solidity that they were implemented in and tested against. This is merely important for projects with ongoing development and does not pose any security threat to us.The contract declares three internal attributes that represent its state: a question (string, line 16), the hash of the answer to this question (byte32, line 20), and the address of the person who asked the question (address, line 18). This is all that the contract needs to carry out its function, which is to decide whether a player provided the correct answer, and if this is the case, to transfer the balance to them. Rather oddly, the contract does not implement the constructor method where these attributes would be initiated. Thus, when deployed, all the attributes receive the default values. The contract further offers additional methods that allow the owner to set the question. Such a solution requires the owner of the contract to run multiple transactions and spend more gas. Again, this appears to be a beginner\u2019s mistake, but in fact, it is a deliberate construct.After deploying the contract, the owner is likely expecting to call method StartGame (line 22). This method sets a question, response hash, and also persists the address of the person who asked the question. However, all of these actions happen only if no response hash exists yet, otherwise the method has no effect. This is taken care of by wrapping the code inside of an if statement.In addition to StartGame, the contract also provides a function NewQuestion (line 42). This function assumes that some question was asked before as it requires that msg.sender is the person who asked the current question. If that is the case, it overwrites the question and bytes of the hash. This method can be called repeatedly by the person who asked the question. This exposes the players to a \u201ctransaction ordering vulnerability\u201d as follows. Assume that a question has been asked by the contract owner. Any player who sends a transaction with an answer would be waiting for the miners to record it in the blockchain. If the question poser changes the question at the same time by invoking NewQuestion method, and if this transaction is mined first, the player\u2019s answer will be answering the wrong question. This method can be called repeatedly, regardless of the state of the contract.Furthermore, the contract offers a method for playing. It accepts an answer and requires some Ether to be sent along with it. Interestingly, the method first checks that msg.sender == tx.origin. The best practices of Solidity warn against the use of tx.origin in order to verify that methods are called by certain users (most frequently the contract owner). However, this is a different and valid use. This construct ensures that there is no middle man in this method invocation, i.e., that the method was called directly by the player\u2019s wallet and not through another contract. Then, if the hash of the provided answer is the same as the hash of the question asked, and if at least 1 Ether was sent along with it, the contract will pay out its balance to the successful player. Otherwise, the Ether sent along will be kept by this contract and will become a part of the reward.The contract allows the question poser to stop the game and retrieve all the Ether by calling function StopGame (line 34). This is another exposure to the transaction ordering vulnerability. If a player sends an answer with some Ether, and if the question poser decides to stop the game while the player\u2019s transaction is waiting, the player will lose either gas if the provided answer is correct (the player will win and receive the Ether sent along less gas), or all the Ether if the answer is wrong. This method can also be called repeatedly regardless the state of the contract.Finally, it also implements an empty fallback (line 51).So, let us summarize. We have some transaction ordering dependence that exposes us to some potential manipulation. Furthermore, the contract has some odd-looking and inefficient constructs. Most importantly, it seems to assume that the data in private attributes are hidden from the world. Beginner\u2019s mistake \u2014 -we can look at the transaction history, we can precisely decipher what the answer is. With the balance of this contract being a bit over 1 Ether, participating in this game seemed like an appealing opportunity for any potential player.At this point, I was convinced that this contract was a scam. I was convinced that something beyond my understanding would cause players to lose their Ether. I decided to see if I could learn more about how this scam worked. I used Etherscan to look at all of the transactions, which included a single internal transaction. I saw the screen below that told me that the owner performed exactly 2 actions:Created the contract in block 5873826 via transaction 0xf9f25d11\u202685c6Asked question \u201cImagine you are swimming in the sea and a bunch of hungry sharks surround you. How do you get out alive?\u201d with the answer \u201cStop Imagining\u201d and added 1.030103834778 Ether as the reward in block 5873943 via transaction 0x41365b3d\u2026fa5bFigure 3: The transaction presumably recording the question and answer.No internal transactions were recorded. So, I transferred some Ether to my Metamask account and went ahead. I first answered the question with no Ether attached. I wanted to create a transaction with the proper answer to doublecheck that it will be encoded exactly that same as when the owner created it. If that is the case, SHA256 should produce the same result. I used MyEtherWallet and Metamask to call the method. An inspection of the created transactions told me my assumption was correct. That was all I needed. I sent in 1.05 Ether (strictly more than 1 in order to satisfy the condition), and the answer. When my transaction got mined, the expected happened! The balance of the contract increased to a bit over 2.08 Ether, and my wallet remained nearly empty.Figure 4: The current state of the contract as it can be found here. The two most recent transactions from address 0x1d971732ec0fc7223204a34d5e915fa502c893ed are created by myself.Clearly, I must have missed something. I kept inspecting the code and the transaction and could not wrap my head around it. The transaction ordering was correct. I could not see anything else in the code, so I deployed it locally and verified the behaviour through tests. Everything behaved exactly as expected. While I was investigating, the balance of the contract dropped to 0 as the question poser stopped the game roughly an hour after my response. And this transaction revealed everything.The contract did not transfer the balance (including my Ether) to a wallet, but to another contract with private source code. When investigating the history of transactions, I found out that there is one internal transaction going to the game contract, and that this transaction does not show up in the history of the game contract\u2019s transactions on Etherscan! The real sequence of actions was as follows:The creator deployed the middle-man contract in block 5806406.The creator deployed the game contract in block 5873826.The creator sent a transaction to the middle-man contract in block 5873890 that made two calls to the game contract. Both these calls are invisible in the transaction history (both internal and external) of the game contract on Etherscan, but they can be found in the traces of the transaction. The calls and parameters can be decoded using the game contract\u2019s ABI that is available on Etherscan and any Ethereum input decoder, for example the one here. The first action calls StartGame with \u201cImagine you are swimming in the sea and a bunch of hungry sharks surround you. How do you get out alive?\u201d as the question setting the right answer to \u201csZs\u201d. The other action calls NewQuestion with the same question and sets the hash to some bytes (see Figure 5).The creator sent a direct transaction in block 5873943 to the game contract\u2019s StartGame with the question \u201cImagine you are swimming in the sea and a bunch of hungry sharks surround you. How do you get out alive?\u201d and answer \u201cStop Imagining\u201d. This transaction had no effect on the state of the contract. The answer hash was no longer 0x0, but this hash was very visible on Etherscan.I came and played with the wrong answer.Figure 5: The decoded inputs for the internal calls made to the game contract.Let us now step back and admire the elaborate construction of this contract that targets the users of Etherscan and similar Ethereum explorers exploiting the fact that Etherscan does not show incoming transactions invoked by external contracts. First, let us look at how StartGame checks that no response exists yet. It wraps the body in an if statement, which plays the role of a silent invisible killer. There are some code alternatives that would achieve the same effect, most prominently using require(responseHash == 0x0). However, the if statement used on line 26 does not cause a throw, so the fact that the state of the contract did not change will not be indicated to the audience by failed transactions.Second, method NewQuestion on line 42 accepts the answer hash, that is, a sequence of bytes. At the same time, playing the game (line 5) asks for the original answer in the form of a string, and StopGame on line 34 does not require the question poser to prove that the answer is known at all. As a result, if we somehow discover that this internal call happened, we are still unable to guess the answer. The blockchain will tell us what its hash is, but from the principle of irreversible hash functions such as SHA256, it does not tell us anything about the input. While we could theoretically start searching for the proper answer using brute force, the search space is infinite. In fact, I am not even aware of a proof that the answer exists! Since StopGame does not require the question poser to reveal the answer, I suggest that even the person who set this contract up does not know what it is, and in fact, the provided sequence are just some random bytes.Lastly, independently of this issue, the developer made all the effort to skew the system to his own benefit. Remember line 9 in Play method that guaranteed that this method cannot be called via another contract, and the transaction ordering vulnerabilities? As a careful player, I would be able to go around the transaction ordering by invoking Play via another contract. This contract would first check that the question and balance did not change; i.e., nobody called StopGame or NewQuestion with a different question, and nobody beat me to the answer that I wanted to guess, and only in such a case, make a call. Yet, this is not possible, because the invocation must come from a wallet.So, what is the message here? Mainly, Etherscan does not reveal everything. There are people out there who know it and exploit it! There are other Ethereum explorers that do not seem to suffer from this issue (I was able to find all the transactions here for example), but there is no guarantee that they do not suffer from different vulnerabilities.This type of scam targets the imperfections of blockchain explorer UIs. In order to counter it, companies operating blockchain explorers should become aware of these vulnerabilities so that they can modify their UI in order to prevent clever scammers from exploiting their users.Luckily, as a user you do not need to rely on an explorer to read the blockchain. If you want to reliably know what happened on the blockchain, read the chain directly!Figure 6: The complete transaction history of the game contract as shown by a different Ethereum explorer.Here are more contracts that I discovered that take advantage of the same vulnerability.This contract is still alive: https://etherscan.io/address/0xce6B1AFf0fE66da643D7A9A64d4747293628D667#codeGame stopped, but Ether was stolen: https://etherscan.io/address/0xFf45211eBdfc7EBCC458E584bcEc4EAC19d6A624#codeGame stopped: https://etherscan.io/address/0x4bc53ead2ae82e0c723ee8e3d7bacfb1fafea1ce#codeGame stopped: https://etherscan.io/address/0x3B048ab84ddd61C2FfE89EDe66D68ef27661C0f2Game stopped: https://etherscan.io/address/0x5ccfcDC1c88134993F48a898AE8E9E35853B2068#code", "responses": 1, "tags": ["Ethereum"]}, {"title": "Check Your DAY Token Balance Using Etherscan or MyEtherWallet in Seconds", "post_link": "https://blog.chronologic.network/check-your-day-token-balance-using-etherscan-or-myetherwallet-in-seconds-2e17670f3943?source=search_post", "author_name": "Toshendra Sharma", "author_link": "https://blog.chronologic.network/@toshendra", "publish_date": "2017-09-15", "last_modified_date": "2018-05-04", "readtime": "2.05", "claps": 190, "voters": 21, "content": "Check Your DAY Token Balance Using Etherscan or MyEtherWallet in SecondsToshendra SharmaFollowSep 15, 2017 \u00b7 3 min readYou have got some DAY tokens and are excited to see them growing on their own.

The changes mainly focus on the effort to improve user experience and provide tools to help users better.On the home page, we begin with the shortening of the navigation menu, changed part of the logo and making it streamline by removing the search bar. Following a banner where all important announcement is being made and on the same line, a toggle on the left enables real-time update of the page on the latest block, transactions an Ether price.The column also indicates the Ether price, latest block number, transactions and history with a dropdown to view the detailed chart, market cap, difficulty and hash rate in one glance.The dark side welcomes youDark mode for Etherscan.io is finally here, we took this opportunity to launch the dark mode following the refreshed look. The toggle to dark mode can be found next to the language button on the page\u2019s footer.The homepage underwent most of the visual changes, the rest of Etherscan mostly remains the same flow and some better to make the transition as easy as possible. Feel free to go through them and let us know if there is anything you like or dislike. Any feedback is welcomed with open arms.Without further ado below are some of the addition to Etherscan added before and after the revamp.Ethereum DirectoryEtherscan also caters a list of all useful resources for Ethereum both submitted by users, sourced and used by the team under Directory. The directory consists of all/most wallets, exchanges, mining pool, learning material, tools for developers and some crypto jobs boards for the use of everyone. Feel free to contribute too.Goerli Testnet ExplorerEtherscan added the support of Goerli Testnet for developers. The Goerli testnet explorer is also introduced to our list of test nets by popular demand.Vyper contract verification & compilerContracts that are written with Vyper, a pythonic Smart Contract Language for the Ethereum EVM can now get verified on Etherscan. Developers can also use the Vyper Compiler with versioning on Etherscan.Address Page Features :The drop-down next to \u201cadd to watchlist\u201d button on an address page hides several features:1.

As the ecosystem grows, so as the type of smart contract and the function of the smart contract in representing value. ERC-721 is the product of this evolution.ERC-721 tokens are non-fungible, meaning that every ERC-721 token has its unique value and is to be treated individually. Unlike ERC-20, every single ERC-20 token is equal in value and is identical and inter replaceable.Think of currency; for example, each ERC-20 token can be compared to a $5 bill (USD) where you could exchange one $5 bill with another $5 bill without the differences in value. For the case of ERC-721, an example of a non-fungible token is CryptoKitties. Each kitty is different in value, having individual traits, and are usually treated as collectible.Comparison for fungible and non-fungible tokensEtherscan recently added support for CryptoKitties, an example of ERC-721 tokens. P.S Cryptokitties contract is created before ERC-721 specification is finalized. Each kitten is an ERC-721 token, individually different and valued.CryptoKitties on Etherscan.ioTo display ERC-721 token on Etherscan, Etherscan tracks all ERC-721 compliant tokens as per the finalized standard at with the following caveats:The token contract must emit at least one ERC-721 compliant transfer event which looks something like:event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 indexed _tokenId);ERC-721 tokens can also contain additional metadata like images. To enable support of viewing these images on Etherscan, we will need to enable support for this on our end manually. Given the nature of images (size, loading times, potential copyright issues, etc.) the option for enabling preview images will be evaluated on a case by case basis at our discretion. This, however, does not affect the tracking of all ERC-721 compliant tokens as we will still show the essential information such as the sender, receiver, tokenID and date/time of the transaction.To enable ERC-721 image viewing support on Etherscan will require the following sent to us here:Project info such as your official website and token iconsThe API endpoint for retrieving the image URLThe average duration/time required for the image to be generated on the source server after the transaction has completed (i.e., 5 minute, 30 minute, 1 hour, etc.)", "responses": 1, "tags": ["Ethereum",

min read#HowToBUIDL (4/n) Series \u2014 Verifying your Smart Contract CodeWhen you deploy code to the public, open, global censorship-resistant Ethereum Blockchain, you are expecting that the functions and services that your Smart Contract provides will be used by participants all over the world. Therefore, it is important to be a good steward of the blockchain community and help the users of your contract be able to trust that the code will do what you claim it will do.Auditors and critics play an important role in the Blockchain world to ensure the code works as intended.We\u2019ll be using the project referenced in the #HowToBUIDL :: Deploy article.There are two major ways to be a good steward of Blockchain principles:1. Use Open Source Repositories \u2014 New development can be tracked & shared2. Verify Smart Contract Code \u2014 Allow people to verify the code before usageDo not trust, but verify. That\u2019s the Mantra.When you expect a person to use a Smart Contract that you have written, either for money transfer or data storage, you are expecting them to digitally sign a transaction that could have significant consequences. Before you force that expectation on the users of your contracts, you should upload the identical source code to Etherscan so that you at least give the users an opportunity to audit the code to independently verify that the code that will execute actually does what you said it will do.Verified code should be an expectation, not an aspiration.For example, if there is an expectation that a user sending a specific amount of Ether to a contract will be assigned a corresponding value of tokens or tickets for a given exchange rate, they should be able to see that the author of the contract is not lying by visually inspecting the logic in the code. In addition, independent audits of the code could spot critical vulnerabilities that would cause people to lose funds, or the business to suffer a severe loss of funds, which would render any investment or purchase of any utility token/ticket useless for every other participant of the Smart Contract.The act of deploying a Smart Contract merely uploads the byteCode of the contract, which is all that the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) needs, but this is not the human readable code. Verified code is the flattened Solidity code for your smart contract. That means, if your contract inherited from another contract or used something like SafeMath as a library, then that code should be included in the uploaded code as well.Steps for Verifying and Publishing your Solidity Source CodeEnter your Contract Source Code.If the Bytecode generated matches the existing Creation Address Bytecode, the contract is then Verified.Contract Source Code is published and publicably verifiable by anyone.Immediately after deploying your Smart Contract, as we did for GreatestShow in the ComeOneComeAll project, you could go to Etherscan and view the contract at its deployed address. As you can see, the Code tab showed a bunch of random looking hex digits starting with 0x60806\u2026 which is the actual byteCode for the deployed GreatestShow as well as the constructor arguments that went into the creation of the contract. Once again, that\u2019s fine for the EVM, but we need to help out humans that want to see the code.Click the Verify And Publish link.Tip: Check out the new Beta Source Code Contract Verifier which supports the \u2018run\u2019 option for verifying Truffle deployed contracts. If your contract uses libraries and fails to verify, you can also try using the beta source code verifier.https://ropsten.etherscan.io/verifyContract2?a=0xContractAddressGoesHereYou should be on the Verify Contract Code (version 2.0) *New screen.Type in the Contract Name, and in our case GreatestShow as well as the version of the compiler that was used when we deployed. Leave Optimization to \u2018No\u2019. If you don\u2019t remember what version you used, type truffle version at the command line in your project. Output looks like:Truffle v4.1.7 (core: 4.1.7)Solidity v0.4.23 (solc-js)So we would choose the v0.4.23+commit version for the CompilerContract Name, Compiler version and flattened Solidity Contract code are required.We\u2019re going to install a tool that will help us generate flattened Solidity code.This tool helps you to verify contracts developed with Truffle on Etherscan, or debugging them on Remix, by merging your files and their dependencies in the right order.npm install --save-dev truffle-flattenerNext, we\u2019ll use the truffle-flattener tool to build a single file of text.truffle-flattener ./contracts/GreatestShow.sol > ./GreatestShowFlattened.solOn a mac you can use the pbcopy tool to copy the text to clipboard.pbcopy < GreatestShowFlattened.solThen, go back to the Etherscan verification window and paste it. Click the \u201cI\u2019m not a robot.\u201d reCaptcha. Next you will see an animated gif of a gear spinning.Etherscan Verification of Solidity Source Code is considered a Smart Contract Best Practice.Tada! After a successful verification, you\u2019re done. You\u2019ll know that your Contract Source Code Verified (Exact Match) as long as the byteCode compiled and tested in this verifcation step matceh the byteCode that was previously uploaded. If it doesn\u2019t match, it will not verify. Changing even one line of the code to try to trick a user would be easily detected. Now you can proudly send users and potential new customers over to your Published & Verified code and Github project for their perusal.Kudos.

Please refer to this blog post for a more in-depth guide. A simple video is also available here and below.Probably the most important, and most widely used Smart Contract in the Cryptocurrency space is the \u201cmultisig.\u201d In Ethereum, the most trusted and used multisig in the space was created by Gnosis, but no contract can be truly trusted by the public unless its code is verified and public. Giveth was surprised to find there wasn\u2019t an easy walk-through to do this for the most used version, so Griff Green and I stepped up to write this post for the Social Coding circle.This walk-through assumes you\u2019ve deployed your multisig using the Gnosis Multisig UI at wallet.gnosis.pm, and assumes that Gnosis hasn\u2019t updated their DApp to a new factory since before March 31st, 2018.This is the address for their DApp\u2019s Multisig factory: 0x6e95c8e8557abc08b46f3c347ba06f8dc012763f. Click that link and find the transaction made from your account that created your multisig.Navigate to view the internal transactions for the transaction that created your multisig and click the address of your new multisig. In the picture below, your freshly deployed multisig would be \u201c0x00cf36853aa4024\u2026 \u201d3. Then navigate to the \u201cContract Code\u201d tab and click \u201cVerify And Publish.\u201d:4.

Compiler: v0.4.19+commit.c4cbbb058. Optimization: No9. Solidity Code: this gist.10. Constructor Arguments. Go back to the transaction that created your multisig, for example this transaction. Locate the input data field. You\u2019ll see a grey box labeled Input Data with lines labeled [0], [1], [2]\u2026Concatenate those lines so you get something like: \u201c00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000600000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000010000000000000000000000004e9946958ead1bbaefed793c33071b6e5d2f55b20000000000000000000000001592121ae8ba596803da6b9f73d6c730faf6c643\u201d and paste that in as your Constructor Arguments.11.

On successful verification, public values of smart contract will visible to all.Usually contract verification is done by visiting Etherscan platform but now it can be done using CLI or inside the code using the NPM package sol-verifier.Contract verified using sol-verifiersol-verifier internally used Etherscan provided API, so for using this you will be required to generate a FREE Api-Key Token from within the ClientPortal->MyApiKey area.sol-verifier can be useful in a case where a new contract is getting deployed repeatedly according to the usecase and contract-verification is required. Using this package verification can be done in series after contract deployment. Along with code, it can be used from command-line by providing required parameter.Also for a contract accepting constructor parameters, one needs to provide ABI encoded arguments on the Etherscan platform, sol-verifier handles it internally and makes it easy for developers.Try this package to verify your contract when you deploy a contract next time. One can know the way to use it here. Hope you will like it and will find it helpful.Also, many breaking changes have been introduced since Solidity v0.5.0. Know about them here and write updated and secure smart contracts.Thanks for reading.

In respect to that, Etherscan displays all token contract deployed onto the Ethereum Blockchain. As a public and free block explorer, all contract will be indexed and displayed regardless. Any token name search with a familiar symbol will return more than one or more identical and/or similar results, and it has become difficult for users to identify which is the actual token contract address for a specific token/ICO that they are intended to participate and engage.We at Etherscan conscious of the importance of providing transparent information to help users to stay vigilant and safe in the Ethereum token contract ecosystem. There are several features in place at Etherscan to help users to remain alert and secure in the Ethereum token contract ecosystem.1. Token InformationThe first thing to check once users visit the token contract address page would be to check for the token information. \u201cIcon image,\u201d \u201cofficial site,\u201d and other social media links should be present. Users can then visit the links and official site to double check if the contract address and official website are the actual project/token/ICO that they are looking.2. Token ReputationThe token reputation system is in place to aid users on the progress and quality of the respective projects. Default awards \u201cUnknown\u201d status. Token contract owner will need to submit basic information, once verified by Etherscan support agent, the token contract may or may not obtain \u201cNeutral\u201d depending on the completeness of the information submitted. The \u201cOk\u201d status is awarded (on Etherscan\u2019s discretion) to significant projects that are subjected to the network effect, has accurate and transparent information displayed and may also be listed on major exchanges.Warning reputation is also in place to warn users of dangerous, scam attempt and phishing token contract address namely \u201cSuspicious,\u201d \u201cUnsafe\u201d and \u201cSpam.\u201d3. The \u201cBlue Checkmark\u201dThe purpose of the \u201cblue checkmark\u201d is to ease users in searching for a respective token contract address. The blue checkmark will allow the awarded token contract address visibility during a token search. Token contracts with the blue checkmark will display on top of other token contract and will get priority during a search. This features will increase relevancy for token name search on Etherscan search bar.Token contracts that have complete information submission, reputable and unique are awarded the blue checkmark.The features mentioned above are mutually exclusive. Token contract owner would need to first submit their token information for updating, followed by Token Reputation then the Blue Checkmark.", "responses": 1, "tags": ["Ethereum", "ICO", "Etherscan", "Token", "Contract Address"]}, {"title": "Validate Etherscan\u2019s transaction with Infura, MyCrypto, and MyEtherwallet", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@kvrncqc/validate-etherscans-transaction-with-infura-mycrypto-and-myetherwallet-36a3fe765042?source=search_post", "author_name": "Kaven Choi", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@kvrncqc", "publish_date": "2018-12-03", "last_modified_date": "2018-12-04", "readtime": "1.27", "claps": 72, "voters": 8, "content": "Validate Etherscan\u2019s transaction with Infura, MyCrypto, and MyEtherwalletKaven ChoiFollowDec 3, 2018 \u00b7 2 min readEthValidate is a tool designed to help users to validate any transactions, addresses, and token balances on the Etherscan\u2019s node with other nodes on the Ethereum blockchain.On Etherscan, users can validate any transaction by clicking into Tools & Utilities > Validate Transaction.

It depends. It mostly depends on your use case. It always comes down to being transparent. If I were into ICOs, I would want to make sure that the token and the crowdsale contract code enforces cryptoeconomics described in the whitepaper (or, ugh\u2026, in the video). Open sourcing the code on GitHub is a great idea but gives no guarantees that the code in the repository is even remotely similar to the one running on-chain. It is a contract after all so it would be good to give other parties a chance to familiarize with the conditions they are going to \u201csign\u201d. Verify the source code even if not everyone has programming skills to read it.For addresses that point to smart contracts, it is possible to get their code.web3.eth.getCode(\"0xd49d7704b72b373f7c7adc14623511e25ecc4a2d\");Since this gives you binary code in hex representation, it is not feasible to try to understand what the contract is doing.Etherscan is very popular (if not the most popular) blockchain explorer. A lot of people use Etherscan to learn more about the transaction or particular address on Ethereum blockchain. It provides multiple services on top of its exploring capabilities. One of them is confirming that binary data under specific address is a result of compilation of the specified source code (that you can read and analyze).Sample projectTo make it more interesting, our sample project will have a constructor that accepts a parameter and extends Ownable contract from zeppelin-solidity. Those simple elements will showcase a few challenges you might come across while trying to verify contract on your own.pragma solidity 0.4.23;import \"zeppelin-solidity/contracts/ownership/Ownable.sol\";contract MessageOfTheDay is Ownable {    string public message;    constructor(string _message) public {        message = _message;    }    function setMessage(string _message)        public        onlyOwner        returns (bool)    {        message = _message;        return true;    }}The full source code is available on GitHub.

Many of you have expressed great understanding of the application of the blockchain in the media and advertising industry. The token sale is live now and will continue for the next four months.We are really big fans of the Etherscan Ethereum Block Explorer tool. The service offers a seamless and integrated way to explore block activity on the Ethereum network. In addition to the activity of Ether (ETH), all ERC20 tokens can be explored on the platform. This means that all transactions, token holders, and other data are publicly available for scanning. The identities behind user addresses are generally unknown. Etherscan is a great example of the promise of a good blockchain because it is a tool that allows people to publically scan the ledger for activity.The ClearCoin (CLR) token contract address is 0xac838aee2f650a6b970ecea56d4651653c1f84a1 and our token contract can be explored using that address. All token transactions are listed within that contract address. Additionally, the token holders and smart contract data can be reviewed.The current view of the contract on Etherscan appears as follows. The reputation will remain NEUTRAL on Etherscan until an exchange listing happens. While we don\u2019t encourage exchange trading, we are aware that users may submit the token to exchanges themselves.The Scannable LedgerEtherscan served as an inspiration for the scannable ledger product that we are building. Part of our product offering is all advertising impressions from media buys tracked on our blockchain. We understand that advertiser and publisher identities are important to be secret. In solving the ad fraud issue, a scannable ledger of impressions that are deemed to be authentic and inauthentic seems like a logical step forward for the industry.Public search engines for the advertising industry seem to be more accepted now as evidenced by the popularity of Moat, an advertising search engine. The advertising industry has embraced Moat as a key player for brand intelligence and analytics. Making the work of the advertising industry public is an ongoing trend. Display ads can live a long time on the Moat search engine and video ads can live a long time on YouTube. The next stage is helping advertisers ensure all of their impressions are indeed authentic.Originally published at clearcoin.co on November 28, 2017.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Blockchain", "Cryptocurrency", "Blockchain Technology", "ICO"]}, {"title": "How to participate in a test TGE XRT using Metamask and Etherscan?", "post_link": "https://blog.aira.life/how-to-participate-in-a-test-tge-xrt-using-metamask-and-etherscan-865febe71862?source=search_post", "author_name": "Mariia Vasileva", "author_link": "https://blog.aira.life/@mariavasss09", "publish_date": "2018-11-19", "last_modified_date": "2018-11-20", "readtime": "2.63", "claps": 55, "voters": 5, "content": "How to participate in a test TGE XRT using Metamask and Etherscan?Mariia VasilevaFollowNov 19, 2018 \u00b7 3 min readNot long ago Sergey Lonshakov announced in Airalab blog the upcoming TGE (Token Generation Event). In my article, I want to share with you one unusual way to conduct Token Sale using Etherscan. Why unusual? Etherscan is one of the default interfaces available for free to communicate with contracts that everyone used to work with through Parity or MyEtherWallet. Recently, Etherscan got two new functions \u2014 readContract and writeContract. These functions are especially interesting for those projects that do not yet have interfaces and dapp for conducting Token Sale. Usually in such cases Parity is used; Metamask is useless without a dapp, because with its help you can only send transactions. Let\u2019s move on to the guideline itself.The Guideline1. Open an auction contract on the Etherscan website2. Go to the writeContract tab:3. Connect Metamask. To do this, you should first unlock it. Then click \u201cConnect with Metamask\u201d:4. In the bid field indicate the amount in ETH that we want to transfer and the address to which we will receive the tokens. Click Write:5. A Metamask confirmation pop-up window will appear:6. Using \u201cView your transaction\u201d button you can check the status of the transaction:7. On the readContract tab you can see how much we transferred to the auction contract:? The difference in the amount sent and received is 2 times, because 2 transactions were sent from my account.8. To get XRT, after the end of the auction in the tab writeContract in the field claimTokens specify your address.? How to understand that the auction is over? In the contract on the readContract tab there are two properties endTime and finalPrice, now they are both equal to 0. When the TGE ends new values \u200b\u200bappear in them. And the auction itself will end when the planned amount of ETH is collected \u2014 the ceiling property (in this case 40 ETH), and the totalReceived field shows the amount that has already been collected.Now you know how to use Etherscan for Token Sale :)On the 21th of November visit our website robonomics.network, complete the survey and participate in the general public rehearsal of TGE XRT starting November, 28!", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Etherscan", "Metamask", "Robonomics", "Tutorials"]}, {"title": "Official Listed on Etherscan", "post_link": "https://medium.com/lightyears/official-listed-on-etherscan-a5774fa2e637?source=search_post", "author_name": "LIGHTYEARS", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@lightyearstoken", "publish_date": "2018-01-10", "last_modified_date": "2018-03-21", "readtime": "1.17", "claps": 53, "voters": 3, "content": "Official Listed on EtherscanLIGHTYEARSFollowJan 10, 2018 \u00b7 2 min readWe like to thank etherscan and the team for listing LightYears Token on their site .

The factory creates a special multisig contract which allows for daily basis ether withdrawals without any confirmations. The factory takes three parameters which is documented here. A list of owners, number of required confirmations and a maximum daily ether withdrawal amount.A list of transactions to the Gnosis factory contract which internally creates a new multisig contract.A closer look at one of the transactions to the factory contract.A look at the internal transactions tab of the specific transaction.The above image is showing the factory address at \u201c0x6e9...\u201d creating a new contract at address \u201c0x8ce...\u201d which is the multisig contract that you are going to interact with. This is the contract that we are going to verify.A look at a contract that is NOT verified.Clicking the \u201cVerify And Publish\u201d link gets you to following page:We don\u2019t really know anything about this newly created contract but looking at the source code for the factory we can deduce the name and also the Solidity Contract Code.The source code for MultiSigWalletWithDailyLimit.sol is under the same folder as the factory on Github. We can copy the source code into Etherscan.io verify contract page but because the contract is also importing the MultiSigWallet.sol we need to modify the code a bit. Delete the import statement and copy the code from MultiSigWallet.sol so you have MultiSigWalletWithDailyLimit.sol AND MultiSigWallet.sol in one file. The verifying page should look something like:The compiler and optimization settings are deduced from the factory contract which already has its contract verified:Last thing that needs to be covered is Constructor Arguments ABI-encoded because our multisig contract was created with three parameters.

This option allows your clients to check the code or to use simple methods like balance checking directly from Etherscan.Etherscan.io verification is a 3-step process which consists of source code publishing, code compiling by etherscan\u2019s backend with initial constructor\u2019s arguments and matching the bytecodes of existing smart contract on the address and the compiled one. Very simple, here is the verification page.Unfortunately, there is an issue. In step 2 we need to provide initial constructor\u2019s arguments in a specific encoded form.

The header of our comments provides a Github link to the exact version of the code that was deployed, in a more comfortable format.Etherscan.io tabsRead ContractThis tab shows the value of every public variable from the smart contract, and allows to query mappings and arrays, for example by providing an address or ID. For example, you can now query the Mt Pelerin User Registry directly, to validate that your address has been whitelisted.To do so:Go to https://etherscan.io/address/0x4e19d015b2b4ff6c0aefc078c9ae1c079bb6a64a#readContractScroll to \u201c3. userID\u201d and input your ETH address in the field below that says \u201c_address\u201dClick \u201cQuery\u201dEtherscan.io userID queryYou will be able to see your user ID below (a number between 1 and userCount, but if it is zero then you are not whitelisted yet).From there you can get many other pieces of information, by using your userId with the functions \u2018validUntilTime\u201d, \u201csuspended\u201d, \u201c\u201disValid\u201d and \u201cextended\u201d (we only use the first key at the moment, to store the KYC level).Write ContractThis is a Beta feature of Etherscan, which allows users to interact with the contract using MetaMask, so that they can call functions that cost gas (and modify the state of the smart contract/blockchain). We do not recommend that you use this tab for any smart contract interaction, until it is out of Beta. In the meantime, we encourage that you experiment with it on testnet if you feel curious, but use the MyCrypto desktop app or website for any smart contract interactions other than simply sending ETH or transferring tokens.EventsThe events tab will now show better logs, for example telling you which function emitted the event.List of Verified Mt Pelerin Smart ContractsYou will find below a list of Mt Pelerin contracts which have had their code verified on Etherescan.The \u201cRelated Deployments\u201d section of the MPS GitHub readme also contains a maintained list of all contracts related to MPS that are deployed on Ethereum main net: https://github.com/MtPelerin/MtPelerin-share-MPS#related-deploymentsMt Pelerin Governance: MPSBoardSigMt Pelerin User Registry: UserRegistryMt Pelerin Share Token: MPSTokenRules for MPS Token:FreezeRuleLockRuleToken Sale Smart Contracts:RatesProviderTokensale phase1TokenMinterMPSSaleConfigTokensale phase2With all the above, you are now able to check by yourself what is on the blockchain and the nature of our claims.For a more user-friendly view, we have also developed a dashboard that will help you keep an eye on the evolution of the token sale, check its exchange rates, and lookup your personal investor status.

Most of that $300 is from a token called\u00a0hydro. I sent the hydro to this wallet when I made it because I\u2019d already made over $3 grand from it and this coin was originally an airdrop\u00a0\u263a. so I sent at the time it was $100 worth. It just makes the wallet have some real value. Honestly I\u2019m not sure if this matters or not for most of these airdrops but I did it anyway just in case. Probably just $10 of Ethereum would be enough. It just means if u made some mistake on the airdrop then they might reconsider when they look on etherscan they will see its a new wallet but at least its got something in it.This tab shows you the tokens and their value if they have a valueAt the bottom of the page click on \u201cerc20 Token Txns\u201dThen scroll to the right to see all the tokens that have arrived and find the info you need to make these tokens show in your walletClick on the token1st make a note of the token symbol \u201c DELTA\u201d and the decimal \u201c8\"Then click on contractThen copy the contract address.Now you have all the info to enter into myetherwallet or whatever wallet your usingContract address 0xDE1E0AE6101b46520cF66fDC0B1059c5cC3d106cDecimal. 8Token symbol.

Either Etherscan is wrong, or the EOS Contract is Wrong?Alex MartellFollowJul 13, 2017 \u00b7 3 min readEDIT: Thanks to Nate Welch, I think I may have found the error in my calculation. I am assigning contributions to windows based on their timestamp, but in reality one can contribute today to any future window, so allocating by timestamp shouldn\u2019t work.I\u2019ve often wondered whether banking tends to select people with masochistic tendencies. I\u2019ve just spent far longer than I care to admit manually checking EOS crowdsale transactions.Why on Earth would I do that? Aside from masochism?Misguided dreams basically. Of gaining a data edge when participating in the EOS crowdsale. I\u2019m building a tool for visualising momentum and whale participation.In any event, it doesn\u2019t matter, once I find a discrepancy, I have trouble letting go. And a discrepancy I have found.TLDR: I cannot get my EOS window totals to match those on eos.io/distribution.At the bottom of this post is a link to a spreadsheet with the manual checks I made which I think mean either Etherscan (my data source) is wrong, or the EOS contract is wrong.I would greatly appreciate any help in figuring this out!The DiscrepancyAs I was building my retire-young-money-making-tool, I noticed that my EOS window ETH contribution totals did not match those on the eos.io site.For window 11, I get 15,205.10 ETH vs 15,239.86 ETH per the official siteFor window 12, I get 17,189.07 ETH vs 17,203.50 ETH per the official siteSure it\u2019s not a big difference now, but unless I know why there is a difference, I can\u2019t assume that in future periods the difference won\u2019t blow out to something significant.Anyway, that\u2019s how I justified the need to roll up my sleeves and perform some tests.To be clear, normally in these situations I assume I screwed something up.Test 1: Manually check transactions at boundary windowsFirst, I thought maybe I was screwing up the boundaries between windows, e.g. counting a transaction as belonging to period 13 when it should be in 12.But, that turned out not to be the case, my data is squeaky clean at the boundaries.For example, 0xd3e7d02f7f8a3aabcab0f5c872b262017b260405eacd5c729b37d9e29d8371da was the lucky tx that just sneaked into the window 11 close in my data.This is exactly the same as in etherscan.The poor bastard in the next tx (0x256606b92a08c880977a45f99b790d07b5add1a343083b99f3a1b9a2630b3fc4) sent in ETH and didn\u2019t receive EOS until the following day (I have cold sweats thinking about this happening to me someday).So, conclusion, no boundary issues in my data.Test 2: Compare my data source to a web scrapeSecond, I thought maybe my data was missing transactions, or was somehow screwy relative to the source of truth.Admittedly, I have not checked my data directly against the EOS contract. I don\u2019t even know how to do that.Instead, I took the data I was working with, which I sourced from the etherscan.io api, and compared it to the results of a separate webscrape I did on the etherscan.io site.I was expecting to find missing transactions in my data . . . but nope!Every nano-decimal of ETH that I had in my data matched the ETH from the webscrape.Gah!Possible Reasons for the DiscrepancyA. Something that I haven\u2019t thought of. Any feedback greatly appreciated!B. Etherscan data is wrong.C. The EOS official counts are wrong.The Real Test: Check a transaction list that adds up to the official EOS window contribution amountsThis is where I fall short on Ethereum knowledge and technical skills.As an ex-banker though what I want to do is get a list of all the transactions that add up to the official contribution tallies for each window.That way I can compare, for instance, the transactions that add up to the official 15,239.86 ETH for window 11, with the transactions in my calculation for window 11.If anyone knows how to do this, please let me know . . .thanks!!The

You can imagine Solidity Events like messages from Solidity code to the outer world. Those Events (messages) usually represent what is happening for most cases but for minor cases they does not.Actually, some smart contracts (Mintable tokens) uses this events by passing 0x0 as the \u201cfrom\u201d address. The code looks like:emit Transfer(address(0), _to, _amount);Technically speaking, Solidity Events as like messages (from Solidity to the subscribed listener) and they do not necessarily reflect what is actually happening.Code sample of a Mintable Token:function mint(address _to, uint256 _amount) onlyOwner canMint public returns (bool) {    totalSupply_ = totalSupply_.add(_amount);    balances[_to] = balances[_to].add(_amount);    emit Mint(_to, _amount);    emit Transfer(address(0), _to, _amount);    return true;}So, there is nothing actually transferred from 0x0 address. It is just how etherscan.io displayed the Events that it reads from Ethereum network.To read some discussions about this at you can check the replies to this Reddi question.You may like to check the

Being a newbie to everything crypto-related, he didn\u2019t really know what to do. So I guided him and then I decided to share that with you through this article.As a start, I advised my friend to use Etherscan.Etherscan is the most notorious block explorer of the Ethereum blockchain.It is simply a search engine to verify transactions. It\u2019s a great tool to see if your transaction went through.WHAT IS IT?Etherscan acts like a third party through which you can look up, verify and validate your transactions. It is mainly a read-only interface to the Ethereum blockchain. Thus, it won\u2019t be able to interfere with your private or public keys and will only monitor the transaction\u2019s info.It is a great tool to explore the Ethereum public ledger blockchain and see different transactions. Etherscan exists as an independent entity and is not funded by the Ethereum foundation.HOW TO USE IT?Ether transactionEtherscan makes you able to check the status of your transaction, the amount of gas used, the number of block confirmations etc. To see your transaction\u2019s info, look up its hash on Etherscan.Let\u2019s take his Ether transaction as an example:1.Transaction hash:This is basically the transaction\u2019s ID, a unique identifier for every single transaction.2.Status:This indicated the status of the transaction. It makes you see if the transaction was successful or not. In our case, it was. But this status can also be \u201cpending\u201d or \u201cfail\u201d(due to a gas shortage for example).3.From and To:These sections indicate the addresses from and to which the transaction has been made.4.Value:The amount of Ether sent and its value in USD. Here it is equal to 0.005 Ether.5.Transaction fee:This is how much that transaction costs (transaction fee=gas cost * gas used)6.Gas limit, gas used by transaction and gas price:This section shows the maximum amount of gas the sender is willing to buy for the transaction, the actual amount of gas used and the price of gas in Ether (One Gwei is 10^-9 Ether).To know more about gas, check out this article.7.Nonce:A number that represents the number of transactions the sender\u2019s account has made on the network. It increases with every transaction. Here you can see that the user who sent the SaTT tokens to my friend has made 102 transactions.ERC-20 token transactionFor a not yet listed token, the transaction info on Etherscan would look like this:The difference between this transaction and the first one is that the value for this one is 0 Ether since we are sending SaTT Tokens. You can see the exact amount of tokens sent in the \u201cTokens Transferred\u201d section (here it is 200 SaTT Tokens).You may be asking questions about Input Data.To decode it, just click on \u201cView Input As\u201dThis way, you can see the details of your transaction as well as millions of other public transactions on the network!Originally published at https://blog.satt-token.com on July 18, 2019.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Etherscan", "Blockchain"]}, {"title": "The \u2018silver lining\u2019 of the Etherscan hack", "post_link": "https://cryptodigestnews.com/the-silver-lining-of-the-etherscan-hack-ec8ef89338be?source=search_post", "author_name": "Mehran Muslimi", "author_link": "https://cryptodigestnews.com/@m.muslimiblog", "publish_date": "2018-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2018-08-30", "readtime": "1.79", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "The \u2018silver lining\u2019 of the Etherscan hackMehran MuslimiFollowAug 1, 2018 \u00b7 2 min readOne of the big attractions of the blockchain is that it is a public ledger. Anyone can have a look at the cryptocurrency transactions that have taken place. But where do you go to find this public information?Usually, people use websites that are called \u2018BlockExplorers\u2019. At these sites, you can search transactions, view recent trends, or even look up the activity of a specific crypto account. One of the most widely used of these sites is Etherscan, which is a BlockExplorer site for the Ethereum blockchain. On 23rd July it was targeted by a hacker and what took place could have an effect on the wider crypto market.The hack was not an extraordinary one; it used a technique that has been seen before. The hacker added a pop-up to the site displaying \u20181337\u2019, which is a really old code for \u201cyou\u2019ve been hacked.\u201d Etherscan users warned others via Twitter and the Etherscan team posted an update about the situation on Reddit.How the hack workedThe problem for the wider community lies in how the hack was done. All the hacker did was leave this comment on the site (this link just shows you a screenshot of it) and that enabled the appearance of the pop-up.The team disabled comments quickly and then started testing the vulnerabilities. They also informed all Etherscan users that none of their funds had been touched and they were still secure.In reality, the hacker couldn\u2019t have touched the funds of Etherscan users anyway, as the site doesn\u2019t include a digital wallet service, meaning it doesn\u2019t actually \u201chold\u201d any cryptocurrencies.The chaos the hack could have causedBut, the hacker could have caused another type of mayhem that might have had a huge impact on the entire crypto community. Security researcher Scott Helme told Motherboard, \u201cThey could alter the prices shown on graphs, maybe cause a buy/sell. I\u2019m sure that tampering with the values could impact people.\u201d Yes, that would have had a significant impact on the market and who knows what we would have had to do to correct it.While this hack didn\u2019t have a negative effect on Etherscan users, it draws attention to vulnerabilities and this is affecting investor confidence. On the plus side, it alerted the Etherscan team to this security vulnerability, and may have actually helped to prevent a future hack that could have had a much more negative impact on the cryptocurrency markets.

One of the leaders in block research, Etherscan, however, was inaccessible this morning due to technical difficulties. Etherscan managed to climb into the world\u2019s top block exploring software products to date. Nevertheless, they too suffered from software problems. No information is yet public from Etherscan\u2019s officials, but the primary cause of the downtime is most probably API incompatibility.Other crypto data giants, such as Coin360 and Coinmarketcap also experienced technical difficulties. Coinmarketcap was also accused of manipulating trading volume data.This is not the first time Etherscan is down. Reports show problems in November 2017 and April 2018.How APIs changed the game?APIs are developers\u2019 best friends, regarding complex data sourcing from multiple instances. An API gives companies and developers easy access to many useful features, such as address lookup and transaction history.APIs are ensuring the Blockchain remains secure and transparent, without blockchain fintech startups having to invest large amounts of cash for research and development.So, if Etherscan is down, what are the alternatives?Many companies are relying on their API development and research, but nowadays fintech owners are more and more shifting towards third-party API solutions, as they are less expensive in the long run.Blockexplorer.one is another excellent alternative to in-house custom API integration. Users can monitor the state of four main blockchain networks \u2014 Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin.Blockexplorer.one is also allowing testnets monitoring, such as Ethereum\u2019s Ropsten and Rinkeby. Users can also monitor Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin testnets.CryptoAPIs recently made a mark in the crypto field with their real-time blockchain and exchange APIs. Providing real-time data is the most critical thing in the fast-paced world of cryptocurrencies. The company offers dedicated blockchain, crypto market, exchange, and private wallets APIs. The possibilities are endless \u2014 users can create and manage wallets, get push notifications for blockchain events, and KYC and AML management. Trading automation, automatic hot to cold wallet transfers, and live data feeds are also available.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Bitcoin", "Cryptocurrency", "Exchange", "Trading"]}, {"title": "Nh\u1eadn \u0110\u01b0a Token ERC-20 L\u00ean Etherscan.io", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@devteaminc/nh%E1%BA%ADn-%C4%91%C6%B0a-token-erc-20-l%C3%AAn-etherscan-io-594b6645e152?source=search_post", "author_name": "DevteamInc", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@devteaminc", "publish_date": "2019-01-29", "last_modified_date": "2019-03-02", "readtime": "3.93", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "Nh\u1eadn \u0110\u01b0a Token ERC-20 L\u00ean Etherscan.ioDevteamIncFollowJan 29 \u00b7 4 min readVi\u1ec7c c\u00f3 \u0111\u01b0\u1ee3c m\u1ed9t \u0111\u1ed3ng ti\u1ec1n \u1ea3o ri\u00eang, l\u1edbn m\u1ea1nh v\u00e0 gi\u00e1 tr\u1ecb cao nh\u01b0 Bitcoin, Ethereum l\u00e0 \u0111i\u1ec1u m\u00e0 m\u1ed7i trader \u0111\u1ec1u mong mu\u1ed1n.

"CryptominandoFollowJul 23, 2018 \u00b7 3 min readEtherscan ha sventato un evidente tentativo di hacking in cui l\u2019aspirante aggressore ha tentato di utilizzare la sezione commenti per cercare di infiltrare del codice malevolo.Alcuni utenti che oggi hanno tentano di accedere al sito web ufficiale di Etherscan sono stati accolti da un messaggio popup di JavaScript sospetto che mostrava semplicemente la scritta \u201c1337\u201d, suggerendo che un utente malintenzionato stava tentando di immettere codice dannoso all\u2019interno della piattaforma Web, probabilmente nel tentativo di portare a termine una sorta di truffa.Dopo aver esaminato la questione, Etherscan ha determinato che l\u2019attacco ha avuto origine nella sezione dei \u201ccomments\u201d del sito Web, che consente agli utenti di commentare gli indirizzi di ethereum e che \u00e8 attualmente gestito dal famoso servizio di hosting di terze parti Disqus.Il sito Web ha disattivato prontamente i commenti di Disqus riassunti nel footer della pagina del sito e, secondo un annuncio pubblicato su Reddit, sta ora lavorando a una patch che verr\u00e0 incapsulata nel codice HTML del pi\u00e8 di pagina e impedir\u00e0 ulteriori incidenti in futuro.Secondo lo sviluppatore di MyCrypto, Michael Hahn, non sembra che ci sia stati furti anche se il popup \u00e8 stato mostrato \u201ccorrettamente\u201d

But what actually makes a token fully ERC20 compliant?Well the smart contract that generated the tokens needs to define a token name, a token symbol, and the number of decimals that the token can be divided into. It also needs to include a set of very specific functions and events. For a token contract to be ERC20 compliant, it must include all of the following:Token Name:Token Symbol: Decimals:function totalSupply()function balanceOf() function allowance() function transfer()function approve()function transferFrom()event Transfer()event Approval()Our TOTE token of course includes all of the required functions and events, and this can be verified here: https://etherscan.io/tokens?q=0x42be9831fff77972c1d0e1ec0aa9bdb3caa04d47You can also verify the validated smart contract code of the token here: https://etherscan.io/address/0x42be9831fff77972c1d0e1ec0aa9bdb3caa04d47#codeSo in case you haven\u2019t already guessed by the URL links I\u2019ve just shared, the actual smart contract token address that generated the tokens is: 0x42be9831fff77972c1d0e1ec0aa9bdb3caa04d47You can also use Etherscan to check which addresses (or smart contracts) hold these tokens. You can do this by looking at the \u201cHolders\u201d section here: https://etherscan.io/token/0x42be9831fff77972c1d0e1ec0aa9bdb3caa04d47#balancesIf you visit this link before the Ethertote token sale completes, you will see the following token holders:1 0x1c49d3c4895e7b136e8f8b804f1279068d4c3c96 9000000 90.0000%2 0x7f7ba6035e7ce22dd94d92d6687d3cb9542426bd 750000 7.5000%3 0xfb5136361ab5fab28e602ea868909828d2ce23ca 250000 2.5000%So we can see that the first address holds 9,000,000 TOTE tokens (90%), the second address holds 750,000 tokens (7.5%) and the final address holds 250,000 tokens (2.5%)So what are these addresses?Well the first address is the Token Sale smart contract. This is the contract that people wishing to purchase TOTE tokens during the token sale will interact with. I will come back to this smart contract in part 2 of this medium post.The second address in the list is a special smart contract called Team Tokens and represents the TOTE tokens reserved for the Ethertote team. The tokens are time-locked, which means we can only recover them back to our wallet from this smart contract after a certain amount of time has elapsed.Let\u2019s look at this Team Tokens contract for a second. https://etherscan.io/address/0x7f7ba6035e7ce22dd94d92d6687d3cb9542426bd#tokentxnsYou can see that 750,000 TOTE tokens were deposited into this smart contract, which came from this address: 0xfb5136361ab5fab28e602ea868909828d2ce23caThis address is the Ethertote teams ethereum wallet! We generated the TOTE tokens using the smart contract we first mentioned, and the tokens that were generated were initially sent to our team wallet.So then from our wallet, we sent 9,000,000 tokens to the Token Sale smart contract 0x1c49d3c4895e7b136e8f8b804f1279068d4c3c96We also sent 750,000 tokens to the \u201ctime-locked\u201d Team Tokens smart contract 0x7f7ba6035e7ce22dd94d92d6687d3cb9542426bdThe remaining 250,000 tokens still in our Ethertote team wallet are what will be used for marketing, promotion, bug-bounties, giveaways, incentives and other things. So as you can see, this is where all of the TOTE tokens are at right now as of typing this posting: https://etherscan.io/token/0x42be9831fff77972c1d0e1ec0aa9bdb3caa04d47#balancesSo now lets actually focus on the Team Tokens smart contract. How do people know that we can\u2019t just pull tokens out of this smart contract before we say we will?I will begin by identifying a couple of lines you can verify in the actual smart contract code: https://etherscan.io/address/0x7f7ba6035e7ce22dd94d92d6687d3cb9542426bd#codeIf you click on the link and then scroll down the contract code to line 182, you will see the first withdraw function in the smart contract. The function shows the following:// callable by owner only, after specified time function withdraw1() onlyAdmin public { require(now >= unlockDate1); require(withdraw_1Completed == false); require(claimAmountSet == true); // now allow a percentage of the balance token.transfer(admin, (tokensToBeClaimed.div(quarter1)));  emit WithdrewTokens(thisContractAddress, admin, (tokensToBeClaimed.div(quarter1))); // 25% withdraw_1Completed = true; }The first line is a comment, and is ignored by the smart contract. Any line that begins with // is just a note or a comment to provide some information on the function.On the second line you will see the function name which is called withdraw1() and it will adhere to the \u201conlyAdmin\u201d modifier. Modifiers can be applied to different functions and are a good way of not having to repeat code for multiple functions. So what exactly is the modfier \u201conlyAdmin\u201d?Let\u2019s a have a look on line 141 of the code to see it:// MODIFIER modifier onlyAdmin { require(msg.sender == admin); _; }So the modifier onlyAdmin is a simple piece of code that is bascially stating that if you apply this modifier to a function, then the function itself requires that \u201cmsg.sender\u201d is equal to \u201cadmin\u201d. In solidity programming we use a double equal sign (==) to confirm that one thing is equal to another. We don\u2019t use a single = sign, as this would in fact be used to \u201cassign\u201d a value to a variable. I will expand on this shortly.So what is \u201cmsg.sender\u201d and what is \u201cadmin\u201d?Well \u201cmsg.sender\u201d in Ethereum is the detected address of the person (or contract) calling the function. If we (the Ethertote team) attempted to call this function, and we were logged into MetaMask with our Ethertote team wallet address (0xfb5136361ab5fab28e602ea868909828d2ce23ca) then \u201cmsg.sender\u201d would be this address.OK so the onlyAdmin modifier is stating that \u201cmsg.sender\u201d must be equal to \u201cadmin\u201d. What is \u201cadmin\u201d?Let\u2019s have a quick look at lines 151 of the code:constructor () public { admin = msg.sender;This is the constructor function. It is a special function in Solidity programming for smart contracts, as it is a function that is automatically called when a smart contract is deployed to the blockchain. It is a one-time function ,which can never be called again. It only executes as the contract gets deployed.So we can see that as part of the constructor function, \u201cmsg.sender\u201d is being assigned to the variable \u201cadmin\u201d. Take note of the fact that this uses just one = sign. When Solidity programs use a single = sign, it is used to assign whatever is to the right of the = sign, to a variable declared on the left of the = sign.You can think of it like this:admin \u2190 msg.senderBasically take whatever msg.sender is, assign that to the variable \u201cadmin\u201d.So who would be msg.sender? Well it would be whoever deployed the contract. Now because it was the Ethertote team that deployed the contract using the Ethertote team wallet (0xfb5136361ab5fab28e602ea868909828d2ce23ca) it would mean that this wallet address is assigned to the variable of \u201cadmin\u201dSo where is the actual admin variable?The variable was declared up on line 84 of the contract code:address public admin;The variable was declared as an address variable that will be publicly visible to everyone, and was given the name \u201cadmin\u201dBringing this all together it means that when the contract was deployed to the block-chain, the constructor function assigned the address detected as msg.sender, and assigned it to the variable \u201cadmin\u201dStill with us?Right so now as far as the modifier \u201conlyAdmin\u201d is concerned, in order to call any function that includes this modifier, there is a requirement for msg.sender to be equal to admin.If somebody calls this function, and they are not connected to Metamask with the address stored in the \u201cadmin\u201d variable, then the person won\u2019t be able to call the function, and the contract will throw an error.If we now go back to the withdraw1() function, and take a look at the next few lines, we will see some additional \u201crequire\u201d statements. These statements must be adhered to or the function call with throw an error.So the first one is:require(now >= unlockDate1);so this is basically saying that what ever the time is right now, the time must be greater than or equal to the time stored in variable \u201cunlockDate1\u201dSo what is the time stored in variable \u201cunlockDate1\"?Let\u2019s have a look on lines 89\u201393// the first team withdrawal can be made after: // GMT: Saturday, 1 December 2018 00:00:00 // expressed as Unix epoch time  // https://www.epochconverter.com/ uint256 public unlockDate1 = 1543622400;Recall what I said about comments? That\u2019s right, the first 4 lines of this code are just comments. It\u2019s the final line that is actually important.We can see that the variable unlockDate1 is set to a value of 1543622400With solidity programming, we express times and dates in something known as Unix Epoch timestamps. When you first look at these values, it\u2019s not obvious as to what time and date they actually represent, but luckily there are loads of tools on the internet that can help you convert Unix epoch timestamps to human-readable times, and vice versa.Here is a good link to check what time this represents:Epoch Converter - Unix Timestamp ConverterEasy epoch/Unix timestamp converter for computer programmers. Includes epoch explanation and conversion syntax in\u2026www.epochconverter.comYou can check using this website to see that this timestamp value represents Saturday, 1 December 2018 00:00:00 GMT+00:00So the require statement in the function is stating that the now time, must be greater than or equal to Saturday 1st December 2018 at 00:00:00If you call the function and the \u201cnow\u201d time is less than this time, the function will throw an error.OK so the next require statement shows the following:require(withdraw_1Completed == false);It\u2019s telling us that the value stored in variable \u201cwithdraw_1Completed\u201d must be equal to falseThis particular variable is known as a boolean. Basically the value of a boolean variable can either be false or true. Nothing else. When variables are first declared, they will always be false, unless they are explicitly declared as true.Let\u2019s look at this variable on line 136bool public withdraw_1Completed;As you can see it was not explicitly assigned a value of \u201ctrue\u201d (or else it would have said bool public withdraw_1Completed = true;) so therefore we know it to be false.Going back to our function, the require statement shows that withdraw_1Completed must be equal to false, which it will be, so this require statement will be valid, and would not throw an error.As for the next require statement:require(claimAmountSet == true);This line is telling us that the variable \u201cclaimAmountSet\u201d must be equal to true.This boolean variable can be found at line 120 of the code and actually starts off as \u201cfalse\u201d when it is first declared, however the Ethertote team would actually call another function (before they ever call the withdraw1() function) to set this variable to true.This is the other function I am referring to on line 175function setTokensToBeClaimed() onlyAdmin public { require(claimAmountSet == false); tokensToBeClaimed = token.balanceOf(thisContractAddress); claimAmountSet = true; }This function also includes the onlyAdmin modifier, and it requires that claimAmountSet is equal to false, which it would be to begin with. The function then assigns the token balance of the contract to a variable called \u201ctokensToBeClaimed\u201d before finally setting the \u201cclaimAmountSet\u201d variable to true.So what impact does this have? Well, once this \u201cclaimAmountSet\u201d variable is set to true, it in fact means that this variable could never be run again, because it would subsequently throw an error when it reaches the require statement of claimAmountSet == falseIn essence, this function can be called once, and that\u2019s it.So now if the Ethertote team have called this function once, then \u201cclaimAmountSet\u201d must now be equal to true, which means that if we refer back to the withdraw1() function, it will also now pass this require statement.If we get this far, and have met all the requirements, then the actual transfer of tokens is possible. This is executed with the following line:token.transfer(admin, (tokensToBeClaimed.div(quarter1)));This line of code is basically transsferring tokens to the address stored in the \u201cadmin\u201d variable (The Ethertote team wallet address) and the actual amount to be sent is the number stored in the \u201ctokensToBeClaimed\u201d variable, divided by the value stored in the \u201cquarter1\u201d variable.Let\u2019s have a quick look at these two variables. Firstly \u201ctokensToBeClaimed\u201dDo you recall the \u201csetTokensToBeClaimed\u201d function that we needed to call prior to calling withdraw1() function? Well that particular function assigned the total balance of the smart contract to the variable \u201ctokensToBeClaimed\u201d, so however many tokens were stored in the smart contract when that function was called, it means that this value is now stored in the \u201ctokensToBeClaimed\u201d variable.What about the \u201cquarter1\u201d variable?This can be found on line 132 of the contract code:uint public quarter1 = hundredPercent.div(percentageQuarter1);This variable is telling us that quarter1 is equal to the value stored in variable hundredPercent, divided by the value stored in variable percentageQuarter1So what about these two variables?Line 129:uint public hundredPercent = 100;Line 124:uint public percentageQuarter1 = 25;Basically quarter1 is equal to 100/25 = 4Now we now what the quarter1 variable represents, we can go back to the actual token transfer line of code in the withdraw1() function:token.transfer(admin, (tokensToBeClaimed.div(quarter1)));We can now see that the value stored in \u201ctokensToBeClaimed\u201d will be divided by 4. This of course means that for the first function we can call one quarter (25%) of the total token balance.So this is how much we can transfer to admin (Ethertote team wallet address)The next line is simply an \u201cevent\u201d block-chain advertisement, which gets added to the blockchain and represents a human-readable event to see what happened during this function call.emit WithdrewTokens(thisContractAddress, admin, (tokensToBeClaimed.div(quarter1))); // 25%The event is called WithDrewTokens, and it\u2019s stating that a specific amount of tokens was sent to the admin address.Last but not least is the line of code in the function that sets the variable \u201cwithdraw_1Completed\u201d to true.withdraw_1Completed = true;Hopefully you will recall that one of the first require statements in this function was that the withdraw_1Completed variable must be equal to false?Well this means that if you successfully called this function and everything executed, then this particular function can never be called again, because after the first function call, the withdraw1_Completed variable will be set to true and therefore the function call will throw an error if called more than once. This is of course to prevent calling the function over and over again. It means once 25% of the tokens are withdrawn using this function, it can never be called again.Hopefully that makes sense and provides some insight as to how the TeamTokens contract works.Next up in part 2 I will break down the actual Token Sale contract.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Token Sale", "Ethertote", "Solidity", "Smart Contracts"]}, {"title": "", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@agney/here-is-the-smart-contract-that-manages-all-the-cryptokittens-in-a-network-https-etherscan-io-62b297bceebc?source=search_post", "author_name": "Boy with Silver Wings", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@agney", "publish_date": "2018-01-12", "last_modified_date": "2018-01-12", "readtime": "0.43", "claps": 1, "voters": 1, "content": "That makes sense.1Tony LittleBoy with Silver WingsFollowJan 12, 2018 \u00b7 1 min readHere is the smart contract that manages all the cryptokittens in a network: https://etherscan.io/address/0x06012c8cf97bead5deae237070f9587f8e7a266d#readContractIf you look close enough, you can see the method Pause which can render all kittens in the network frozen.The UI isn\u2019t the problem at all.

Etherscan is an excellent resource, with many impressive features adding much value to the technical users of Ethereum. Disqus also stands out as one of the more popular social media forums, with many esteemed and devoted adherents.Established elsewhere in numerous articles, we can see that the real strength and value in community driven projects is in the community itself, and that these communities are essentially non-profits. Take the crypto-currencies of Bitcoin and Ethereum for example. One of the key attractions for investors is the knowledge that each of these communities grows in value with each additional investor, at no real cost to the investor. We can see that there appears a disparity between profit-making, and community building. Like cats and birds, the two do not go hand-in-hand. Where they are put together, there will be tears.In the case of Etherscan and Disqus, and their involvement in Ethereum, I can testify that right now, those tears are from the founders of prospective new non-profit Ethereum based token projects such as VRENAR, i.e. examples of the lifeblood of the new technology development opportunities originally made possible by the advent of ICOs and token sales.Most token investors should see by now the red flags flying all over ICO and token sale based projects driven by profit. In the longer term, many tears will be shed from investors losing much money to such projects when they inevitably disappear in a puff of smoke. After all, how can profit making entities ever hope to compete long term with non-profit communities offering everything for free?The problem is that both Etherscan and Disqus are ad-driven. This means they each expect to profit by advertising new projects. The only new projects that could feasibly afford to pay for such advertisements are those based on making profits, which as outlined above, are not in the best interests of investors.The result is that any attempts by genuine non-profits to publicise their new projects via Etherscan and/or Disqus are immediately labelled as \u201cSpam\u201d and removed. Further, since Etherscan supplies only embedded Disqus text fields for developers to supply the technical information on their smart contracts and tokens, even the information added there is removed also as \u201cSpam\u201d, if it has not been paid for by the developer or their organisation, thus it is almost impossible for anyone to start using the new tokens and contracts of a new non-profit community.To see what this looks like from the point of view of a founder of a new non-profit Ethereum token community technology, have a look at this screenshot from my own Disqus profile below:In this, you can see at the top a comment I tried to make in response to a good Disqus article by a writer, William Mougayar, for whom I have much respect, with how his points relate to the VRENAR project. This is a standard Systems Engineering technique, where we trace stakeholder concerns (the points in the article), to how our system addresses them. In the red highlighted text automatically inserted by Disqus, we see the caption \u201cDetected as spam\u201d, followed by the words \u201cThanks, we\u2019ll work on getting this corrected\u201d, which appeared after I clicked on the \u201cDetected as spam\u201d caption when it was originally highlighted in green.When I saw the originally green highlighted text, I took this literally to mean that my article had already been detected as spam. So I clicked on it. In hindsight, maybe what I did was actually flag my own text as spam, who knows. In any case you can see that the software of Disqus does not enable one to protest about one\u2019s own post being labelled as \u201cSpam\u201d. Further, if you look at the articles I have tried to comment on, none contain any sign of my work, including the information seen in Etherscan on my smart contracts and tokens. I have nine entries now in Disqus, and the only person able to see any of them appears to be me alone. Hence my article here in Medium, to try to publicise the problem there.In short, as an answer to this problem, I would suggest both Etherscan and Disqus should adopt some form of subscription as their sources of funding, rather than from advertising new projects, of whom the only ones who can afford it are those most likely to rip off investors in the long run.If you like this article, clap by all means (And Wink!), but a much bigger favour to all future creators of, and investors in Ethereum token based projects, would be to share it wherever you can. This is just one example of a much bigger real issue, of profit vs technology, that needs to be highlighted, and that we owe to ourselves and our children, to deal with as a community.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Nonprofit", "Investing", "Token Sale", "ICO"]}, {"title": "Matou Global Token and Contract on Etherscan", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@MatouEx/matou-global-token-and-contract-on-etherscan-11334698bb72?source=search_post", "author_name": "Matou Ex", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@MatouEx", "publish_date": "2018-06-29", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-29", "readtime": "0.26", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "Matou Global Token and Contract on EtherscanMatou ExFollowJun 29, 2018 \u00b7 1 min readMatou Token: https://etherscan.io/token/0xf3c951793e0d9a05d953d1e6c11fd0fd05f91d85Matou Contract: https://etherscan.io/address/0xf3c951793e0d9a05d953d1e6c11fd0fd05f91d85The Top 100 MTB Holders:", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Exchange", "Token"]}, {"title": "", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@adamabyss/hello-could-you-explain-to-me-why-my-ice-tokens-dont-show-up-on-www-etherscan-io-c817e3766ece?source=search_post", "author_name": "Adam Byrne", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@adamabyss", "publish_date": "2017-09-15", "last_modified_date": "2017-09-15", "readtime": "0.25", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "Guide: How to view your iDice (ICE) Tokens!25iDiceAdam ByrneFollowSep 15, 2017 \u00b7 1 min readHello, could you explain to me why my ICE tokens don\u2019t show up on www.etherscan.io?

This is often necessary \u2014 you can\u2019t mine a token!But it is time for that to changeBack in the good old days of 2012 and 2013 when cryptocurrencies were just fruiting, many new blockchains launched. These never had ICOs. Litecoin, Dogecoin, Peercoin, Anoncoin, Darkcoin (Dash), Feathercoin\u2026 not a single one.You could obtain these coins for free by mining using Proof of Work. In this way, the coins were fairly and evenly distributed. Sure, there was trading and speculation. But there were no coin creators trying to scam the masses out of their money.The first mineable ERC20 TokenA reference implementation for a mineable ERC20 token has been launched at Ethereum address 0xb6ed7644c69416d67b522e20bc294a9a9b405b31. This combines the scarcity and fair distribution model of Bitcoin with the speed and power of the Ethereum ecosystem. Thus, it is named 0xBitcoin or 0xBTC where 0x represents the Ethereum Network and ecosystem.You will find some familiar properties. A total of 21,000,000 tokens are available to be mined. A diminishing \u2018block reward\u2019 is mined every ~10 minutes thanks to regular difficulty adjustments. Finally, you can use these tokens to interact with all ERC20 based services including Metamask, Parity, 0x, RadarRelay, EtherDelta, and other smart contracts.New tokens are minted using the following Proof of Work contract function:(taken from https://github.com/0xbitcoin/0xbitcoin-token)function mint(uint256 nonce, bytes32 challenge_digest) public  returns (bool success) {      uint reward_amount = getMiningReward();       bytes32 digest =  keccak256(challengeNumber, msg.sender, nonce );        if (digest != challenge_digest) revert();   //the digest must be smaller than the target   if(uint256(digest) > miningTarget) revert();    uint hashFound = rewardHashesFound[digest];   rewardHashesFound[digest] = epochCount;   if(hashFound != 0) revert();     //prevent the same answer from awarding twice   balances[msg.sender] = balances[msg.sender].add(reward_amount);   tokensMinted = tokensMinted.add(reward_amount);   //set readonly diagnostics data   lastRewardTo = msg.sender;   lastRewardAmount = reward_amount;   lastRewardEthBlockNumber = block.number;       //start a new round of mining with a new 'challengeNumber'   _startNewMiningEpoch();   Mint(msg.sender, reward_amount, epochCount, challengeNumber );   return true;}As you can see, a special number called a \u2018nonce\u2019 has to be passed into this function in order for tokens to be dispensed. This number has to fit a special \u2018puzzle\u2019 similar to a sudoku puzzle, and this is called Proof of Work (PoW). To find this special number, it is necessary to run a mining program. A cpu miner exists for mining PoW tokens and it can be downloaded here:0xbitcoin/0xbitcoin-miner0xbitcoin-miner - Mine the 0xbitcoin RC20 token using a command line NodeJS applicationgithub.comSo far, less than 100 rewards have been mined, but it has only been about twelve hours. Hopefully many more tokens will switch to a mining distribution model so we can stop with all of the ICOs.

The main benefit of this feature is that it allows users to check what contracts do by reading their source code. Etherscan makes sure that the code matches the smart contract as deployed.The list of verified contracts is long. As of this writing, Etherscan offers the source code for 26055 contracts, which can be browsed here.On a lazy Sunday afternoon I decided to casually browse it to see what kind of contracts people were running and get a sense of what people use the blockchain for, and how well written and secure these contracts are. Most contracts I found implemented tokens, crowdsales, multi-signature wallets, ponzis, and.. honeypots!Honeypot contracts are the most interesting findings to me. Such contracts hold ether, and pretend to do so insecurely. In short, they are scam contracts that try to fool you into thinking you can steal the ether they hold, while in fact all you can do is lose ether.A common pattern they follow is, in order to retrieve the ether they hold, you must send them some ether of your own first. Of course, if you try that, you\u2019re in for a nasty surprise: the smart contract eats up your ether, and you find out that the smart contract does not do what you thought it did.In this post I will analyze a couple honeypot contracts I came across, and explain what they seem to do, but really do.The not-really-insecure non-lotteryThe first contract I will go through implements a lottery that, apparently, is horribly insecure and easy to steal from with a guaranteed win. I have come across several of these. The last instance I found is deployed at address 0x8685631276cfcf17a973d92f6dc11645e5158c0c, and its source code can be read here. I am copying the code below for convenience. Can you spot the bait? Can you tell why, if you try to exploit it, you will actually lose ether?pragma solidity ^0.4.23;// CryptoRoulette//// Guess the number secretly stored in the blockchain and win the whole contract balance!// A new number is randomly chosen after each try.//// To play, call the play() method with the guessed number (1-16).  Bet price: 0.2 ethercontract CryptoRoulette {    uint256 private secretNumber;    uint256 public lastPlayed;    uint256 public betPrice = 0.001 ether;    address public ownerAddr;    struct Game {        address player;        uint256 number;    }    Game[] public gamesPlayed;    constructor() public {        ownerAddr = msg.sender;        shuffle();    }    function shuffle() internal {        // randomly set secretNumber with a value between 1 and 10        secretNumber = 6;    }    function play(uint256 number) payable public {        require(msg.value >= betPrice && number <= 10);        Game game;        game.player = msg.sender;        game.number = number;        gamesPlayed.push(game);        if (number == secretNumber) {            // win!            msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);        }        //shuffle();        lastPlayed = now;    }    function kill() public {        if (msg.sender == ownerAddr && now > lastPlayed + 6 hours) {            suicide(msg.sender);        }    }    function() public payable { }}It\u2019s easy to tell that the shuffle() method sets secretNumber to 6. Hence, if you call play(6)and send it 0.001 ether, you will always win your ether plus whatever the balance of the contract is, namely 0.015 ether. Easy money, right? Wrong.What\u2019s the trick? Look closely at how play() is implemented. It declares a variable Game game, but does not initialize it. It will therefore default to a pointer to slot zero of the contract\u2019s storage space. Then, it stores your address in its first member, storage slot 0, and the submitted number in the second one, that maps to storage slot 1. So, in practice, this will end up overwriting the contract's secretNumber with the attacker account\u2019s address, and lastPlayed with the number submitted.Then, it will compare secretNumber, which is now your account\u2019s address, with the number you submitted. Since you can only submit numbers smaller than 10, you can only win if your account\u2019s address is within the range 0x0 to 0x0a. (Don\u2019t bother trying to bruteforce-search for one account in that small range! Simply unfeasible.)So, the comparison will fail, and the contract will keep your ether. Of course, the attacker can at any time call kill() to retrieve the ether.The not-really-insecure non-riddleThis is another fun one. It had me scratching my head for a while. However, there is a huge giveaway that the contract is up to something nasty right away. But let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves.Here is its code. Can you spot the supposed vulnerability? And, can you tell why an exploit won\u2019t work? And what is the giveaway I was talking about?contract G_GAME{    function Play(string _response)    external    payable    {        require(msg.sender == tx.origin);        if(responseHash == keccak256(_response) && msg.value>1 ether)        {            msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);        }    }        string public question;    address questionSender;    bytes32 responseHash;     function StartGame(string _question,string _response)    public    payable    {        if(responseHash==0x0)        {            responseHash = keccak256(_response);            question = _question;            questionSender = msg.sender;        }    }        function StopGame()    public    payable    {       require(msg.sender==questionSender);       msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);    }        function NewQuestion(string _question, bytes32 _responseHash)    public    payable    {        require(msg.sender==questionSender);        question = _question;        responseHash = _responseHash;    }        function() public payable{}}The code supposedly implements a riddle. It sets up a question, and, if you can tell what the answer is, it will presumably send you its balance, currently a little more than 1 ether. Of course, to produce an answer, you must send an ether first, which you will get back if you are correct. The code seems fine, but there is a dirty trick: notice how NewQuestion allows questionSender to submit a hash that does not match _question. So, as long as this function isn\u2019t used, we should be alright.Can we tell what the question and answer are? If you read the transaction history of the contract on etherscan, it appears that the 2nd transaction sets up the question. It\u2019s even more obvious if you click the \u201cConvert to UT8\u201d button on etherscan. This reveals the question \u201cI am very easy to get into,but it is hard to get out of me. What am I?\u201d, and the answer \u201cTroublE\u201d.Since this transaction is called, according to etherscan, after the creation of the contract, responseHash is going to be zero, and will become keccak265(\"TroublE\"). Then, there is a third transaction that loads up one ether in the contract. So, apparently, we could call Play(\"TroublE\") and send one ether to get two ether back. Too good to be true? Probably. Let\u2019s make sure.We can make sure we will the contract\u2019s ether by inspecting the state of the smart contract. Its variables are not public, but still all it takes is just a few extra strokes to retrieve their values by querying the blockchain. questionSender and responseHash are the 2nd and 3rd variables, so they will occupy slots 1 and 2 on the storage space of the smart contract. Let\u2019s retrieve their values.web3.eth.getStorageAt(\u20180x3caf97b4d97276d75185aaf1dcf3a2a8755afe27\u2019, 1, console.log);The result is `0x0..0765951ab946f3a6f0379680a6b05fb807d52ba09`. That spells trouble (pun intended) for an attacker, since the transaction setting up the question came from an account starting with0x21d2. Something\u2019s up.web3.eth.getStorageAt(\u20180x3caf97b4d97276d75185aaf1dcf3a2a8755afe27\u2019, 2, console.log);The result is `0xc3fa7df9bf24\u2026`. Is this the hash of \u201cTroublE\u201d?web3.sha3('TroublE');That call returns 0x92a930d5..., so it turns out that, if we were to call Play(\"TroublE\") and send 1 ether, we\u2019d actually lose it. But how is it possible that the hashes do not match?Notice how StartGame does nothing if responseHash is already set. Clearly, that second transaction did not alter the state of the contract, so it must have already been set before this transaction. But how is it possible that responseHash was already initialized, if that was the first transaction after the creation of the contract?After some serious head scratching, I found a recent interesting post on honeypot contracts that explains that Etherscan does not show transactions between contracts when msg.value is zero. Other blockchain explorers such as Etherchain do show them. Surely enough, etherchain reveals a couple additional transactions in the contract\u2019s history, where a contract at 0x765951.. modifies responseHash via a zero-value transactions.So let\u2019s check these transactions; perhaps the ether can still be stolen? To track what happened, we need to decode these calls. We can get the contract\u2019s ABI from Etherscan, and the internal transaction data from the \u201cparity traces\u201d of Etherchain (first, second). That\u2019s all we need to decode the transactions into human readable format.const abiDecoder = require('abi-decoder');const Web3 = require('web3');const web3 = new Web3();const abi = [{\u201cconstant\u201d:false,\u201dinputs\u201d:[{\u201cname\u201d:\u201d_question\u201d,\u201dtype\u201d:\u201dstring\u201d},{\u201cname\u201d:\u201d_response\u201d,\u201dtype\u201d:\u201dstring\u201d}],\u201dname\u201d:\u201dStartGame\u201d,\u201doutputs\u201d:[],\u201dpayable\u201d:true,\u201dstateMutability\u201d:\u201dpayable\u201d,\u201dtype\u201d:\u201dfunction\u201d},{\u201cconstant\u201d:false,\u201dinputs\u201d:[{\u201cname\u201d:\u201d_question\u201d,\u201dtype\u201d:\u201dstring\u201d},{\u201cname\u201d:\u201d_responseHash\u201d,\u201dtype\u201d:\u201dbytes32\"}],\u201dname\u201d:\u201dNewQuestion\u201d,\u201doutputs\u201d:[],\u201dpayable\u201d:true,\u201dstateMutability\u201d:\u201dpayable\u201d,\u201dtype\u201d:\u201dfunction\u201d},{\u201cconstant\u201d:true,\u201dinputs\u201d:[],\u201dname\u201d:\u201dquestion\u201d,\u201doutputs\u201d:[{\u201cname\u201d:\u201d\u201d,\u201dtype\u201d:\u201dstring\u201d}],\u201dpayable\u201d:false,\u201dstateMutability\u201d:\u201dview\u201d,\u201dtype\u201d:\u201dfunction\u201d},{\u201cconstant\u201d:false,\u201dinputs\u201d:[{\u201cname\u201d:\u201d_response\u201d,\u201dtype\u201d:\u201dstring\u201d}],\u201dname\u201d:\u201dPlay\u201d,\u201doutputs\u201d:[],\u201dpayable\u201d:true,\u201dstateMutability\u201d:\u201dpayable\u201d,\u201dtype\u201d:\u201dfunction\u201d},{\u201cconstant\u201d:false,\u201dinputs\u201d:[],\u201dname\u201d:\u201dStopGame\u201d,\u201doutputs\u201d:[],\u201dpayable\u201d:true,\u201dstateMutability\u201d:\u201dpayable\u201d,\u201dtype\u201d:\u201dfunction\u201d},{\u201cpayable\u201d:true,\u201dstateMutability\u201d:\u201dpayable\u201d,\u201dtype\u201d:\u201dfallback\u201d}];const data1 = '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';const data2 = '0x3e3ee8590000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000040c3fa7df9bf247d144f6933776e672e599a5ed406cd0a15a9f2da09055b8f906700000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000464920616d2076657279206561737920746f2067657420696e746f2c627574206974206973206861726420746f20676574206f7574206f66206d652e205768617420616d20493f0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000';abiDecoder.addABI(abi);console.log(abiDecoder.decodeMethod(data1));console.log(abiDecoder.decodeMethod(data2));Running this code, we get the following result:{ name: \u2018StartGame\u2019,  params: [ { name: \u2018_question\u2019,              value: \u2018I am very easy to get into,but it is hard to get out of me.

Again it\u2019s quite easy to miss that the second call does not use _question to compute the hash; instead, it\u2019s set to an arbitrary value that does not match the string provided in the previous call, although the question does match.So, unless we can find out a value that produces the given hash, possibly via a dictionary attack or a bruteforce search, we\u2019re out of luck. And, given how sophisticated this honeypot is, I would assume trying to bruteforce the hash is not going to work out very well for us.Unraveling this honeypot took quite some effort. Its creator is ultimately counting on attackers trusting the etherscan data, which does not contain the full picture.The giveawayI said this contract contains a dead giveaway that its creator is playing tricks. This is in this line:require(msg.sender == tx.origin);What this line achieves is, it prevents contracts from calling Play. This is because tx.origin is always an \u201cexternal account\u201d, and never a smart contract. Why is this useful for the attacker? A way to safely attack a contract is to call them from an \u201cattack contract\u201d that reverts execution if it didn\u2019t gain ether from attack:function attack() {    uint intialBalance = this.balance;    attack_contract();    require (this.balance > initialBalance);}This way, unless the attacker\u2019s contract\u2019s balance increases, the transaction fails altogether. The creator of the honeypot wants to prevent an attacker from using this trick to protect themselves.ConclusionHoneypots are a moral grey area for me. Is it OK to scam those who are looking to steal from contracts? I don\u2019t think so. But I do not feel very strongly about this. In the end, if you got scammed, it is because you were searching for smart contracts to steal from to begin with.These scams play on the greed of people who are smart enough to figure out an apparent vulnerability in a contract, yet not knowledgeable enough to figure out what the underlying trap is.If you want to get deeper into Smart Contract security, check this amazing wargame called Capture the Ether.

We are extremely grateful for the tremendous amount of support from both our community and the 0x project team throughout these last several months.While there is still a long road ahead to reach our vision of a predominately decentralized ecosystem, it\u2019s important to celebrate major milestones as we grow. This is a small achievement along the path towards a much greater vision for not only our team, but for all decentralized exchanges/relayers.A massive thank you to everyone who has supported us along the way!Major MilestonesThe number of users has grown exponentially to over 25,000!DDEX is currently the #2 Decentralized exchange (DEX) by number of total transactions according to EtherscanDDEX is currently#1 DEXon 0xTrackerfor 7 daysDDEX hit over $8M in daily trading volume on May 9, 2018 (from Coinmarketcap)DDEX is currently the #2 Decentralized exchange (DEX)-https://etherscan.io/stat/dextrackerDDEX is currently the #1 trading volume DEXon 0xTracker: https://0xtracker.com/What makes Hydro unique?Hydro Protocol relayers currently have at least three key advantages over the previous generation of decentralized exchanges:Realtime Trading API: Quants and Market Makers are able to instantaneously create and cancel orders for free.Hydro is looking to collaborate with market makers for Alt Coins from all over the world. Please send us a note if you want to become a market maker on Hydro Protocol (email bowen@ddex.io).Read more on Hydro Open Source API on Github.2. No Deposit, No WithdrawUsing 0x protocol allows us to have a decentralized and trustless settlement layer. This means that there is no need to deposit or withdraw currency into/from the relayer. There is no central party which can be hacked to run away with customers\u2019 funds or to be subjected to government regulations.Funds are always in the users\u2019 wallets while trading on a 0x protocol based DEX. This is one massive security and convenience advantage over other exchange models.3. Intuitive user interface resembling centralized exchangesCreating an intuitive, fast, and easy to use decentralized relayer is challenging task. While we still have plenty of improvements coming, we aim to make our user experience both for new and experienced API traders as easy as possible. The Hydro Protocol enables limit trades similar to centralized exchanges, while still maintaining a decentralized settlement layer through 0x.We still have a great deal of room to improve on all of this and are excited to demonstrate some of these implementations and upgrades in the future.What\u2019s next?DDEX Native Mobile PreviewAs demonstrated at EdCon 2018 (https://youtu.be/NJ9StJThxZY?t=22654), we are preparing to launch our mobile native app in the near future!

But if I want to poke and prod any other curious creations?Well I\u2019d have to fire up my fast node, wait for it to sync up with the most recent block and enter the geth console. Then run a node + web3 script with parameter encoding\u2026 and my urge to throw my precious ether around web3 has long evaporated.So I made ETHEREST as the first tool in the W3K.it. It lets anybody interact with smart contracts easily. You can use the website\u2019s user interface or the API.ETHEREST is hooked into it\u2019s own ethereum nodes and exposes API endpoints for anyone to execute a method call or transaction against any contract address.So how does it work?There are two ways to interact with data stored on the ethereum blockchain. If you want to get data \u2014 you make what\u2019s called a call. If you want to change data by executing a function \u2014 you make a transaction.Getting data from the blockchain with a call using ETHEREST is simple. It\u2019s just a GET request to a URL and it follows a really easy to use pattern:1.https://api.etherest.app/v1/<network>/<contractAddress>/The API URLThe Ethereum network you want it to run on (only \u2018main\u2019 right now)The contract address you\u2019re interacting with2.<methodName>:<methodReturnTypes>/ [\u2018:<methodReturnTypes>\u2019 is Optional]The name of the method.You only need to provide the colon and method return types if there are method outputs but no ABI for the contract is available on ETHEREST. The method return types should be a comma separated list eg. uint,bool,address3.<param1Type>:<param1Value>/<param2Type>:<param2Value>.. [Params are optional]If parameters are required by the method then you provide them as above with forward slashes between each parameter.If an ABI is available on ETHEREST, then you don\u2019t need to provide any of the \u2018<paramType>:\u2019 so it just becomes <param1Value>/<param2Value>You don\u2019t even need to remember this format \u2014 just head to ETHEREST and use our contract explorer:An example ETHEREST interface call of the MAX_OWNER_COUNT on a MultiSigWallet contractYou can call these urls from curl, wget, your web browser or from a request library. It\u2019ll always return the live value from the blockchain. Pretty cool, right? Here\u2019s some examples of it in action:Bancor TokenMultiSigWalletSandwichShopSo what about when I want to buy tokens, gamble or actually do anything?You\u2019re going to need to send a transaction to do that.With ETHEREST you use the same URL pattern as above, but you POST to it with the following body data:{  value: <ether>  privateKey: <4ds23r4..>  senderAddress: <0x..>  gasPrice: <gwei>  gasLimit: <amount>}Here are some examples of transactions:EOS CrowdsaleRoulethBut usually I just use the ETHEREST user interface.

This is a small achievement along the path towards a much greater vision for not only our team, but for all decentralized exchanges/relayers.A massive thank you to everyone who has supported us along the way!Major MilestonesThe number of users has grown exponentially to over 25,000!DDEX is currently the #2 Decentralized exchange (DEX) by number of total transactions according to EtherscanDDEX is currently#1 DEX on 0xTracker for 7 daysDDEX hit over $8M in daily trading volume on May 9, 2018 (from Coinmarketcap)DDEX is currently the #2 Decentralized exchange (DEX)-https://etherscan.io/stat/dextrackerDDEX is currently the #1 trading volume DEX on 0xTracker: https://0xtracker.com/What makes Hydro unique?Hydro Protocol relayers currently have at least three key advantages over the previous generation of decentralized exchanges:Realtime Trading API: Quants and Market Makers are able to instantaneously create and cancel orders for free.Hydro is looking to collaborate with market makers for Alt Coins from all over the world. Please send us a note if you want to become a market maker on Hydro Protocol (email bowen@ddex.io).Read more on Hydro Open Source API on Github.2. No Deposit, No WithdrawUsing 0x protocol allows us to have a decentralized and trustless settlement layer. This means that there is no need to deposit or withdraw currency into/from the relayer. There is no central party which can be hacked to run away with customers\u2019 funds or to be subjected to government regulations.Funds are always in the users\u2019 wallets while trading on a 0x protocol based DEX. This is one massive security and convenience advantage over other exchange models.3. Intuitive user interface resembling centralized exchangesCreating an intuitive, fast, and easy to use decentralized relayer is challenging task. While we still have plenty of improvements coming, we aim to make our user experience both for new and experienced API traders as easy as possible. The Hydro Protocol enables limit trades similar to centralized exchanges, while still maintaining a decentralized settlement layer through 0x.We still have a great deal of room to improve on all of this and are excited to demonstrate some of these implementations and upgrades in the future.What\u2019s next?DDEX Native Mobile PreviewAs demonstrated at EdCon 2018 (https://youtu.be/NJ9StJThxZY?t=22654), we are preparing to launch our mobile native app in the near future!

Their contribution helped make this round the second most expensive ever (#2 @ 41.17 per ETH). At time of writing, they are the 257th largest EOS holder in the world.Remarkably, F2pool caused a spike in the early part of the 214th contribution period, as seen here:This has gone against the prevailing strategy of \u201cwait and see\u201d that the market usually takes with the EOS ICO. The vast majority of contributors will wait until the final minutes to attempt to obtain tokens under or at the market value. It did not play out that way this time as F2Pool contributed a whopping 10.7% percent of the entire rounds worth of Ether.We\u2019re happy to have F2Pool aboard. We believe that EOS will be the dominant distributed network that will be capable of decentralizing the internet, a truly massive and revolutionary undertaking. To have such an established mining pool such as F2Pool commit over $3,000,000 in exchange for future EOS tokens shouldn\u2019t be understated. It means that the incumbents are starting to take notice.F2Pool\u2019s mining operations are spread across BTC, LTC, ETH, ETC, ZEX, SC, DASH, and XMR. Are they looking to add EOS to that list? Here at EOS New York we\u2019ve been wondering what their motivation is. Could they be looking to stake those tokens to vote themselves as a Block Producer once the main network launches? They certainly have the capability to add value to the network but would EOS token holders support F2Pool and vote them in as a Block Producer? The scope of a Block Producer\u2019s responsibilities are far wider than simply running servers. A Block Producer not only needs to run a high performance low latency network, but also needs to be active in the community, continuously add value to the network, and ensure responsiveness with network constituents. F2Pool certainly knows the hardware side of things, but will their hardware expertise translate well into the markedly different governance dynamics on the EOS network?Then again, F2Pool could see EOS as a good investment and believe in the tokens ability to rise in value. However, there are also still over 240 Ether addresses that hold more tokens than F2Pool. It will be interesting to see if other large mining pools begin to dip their toe, or as F2Pool has done, dive head first into what will be a game changing network.Welcome F2Pool to the EOS community!\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014EOS New YorkEOS New York is the preeminent Block Producer candidate for the EOS blockchain network on the eastern coast of the United States.

Systems set up as such are known as \u201choneypots\u201d, set up with the intention to attract attackers, however is monitored and has the intention of diverting or exploiting the original attackers, which in this case results in the attackers losing funds.The contract in question is similar (but not entirely so) to the one below on address 0xE668750B9E902b408d228Ffe41abdb76c9d04cfC:Ropsten Accounts, Address And ContractsThe Ethereum BlockChain Explorer, API and Analytics Platformropsten.etherscan.ioIf we inspect the code, we can see the contract is a naively written contract which acts as a wallet protected with a password. A person could quite easily deploy this contract with any arbitrary password, and should there be the event where the owner no longer has access to the original private keys, he/she could still enter the correct password, match it with the hashedpassword as when set up, and retrieve all funds.The assumption the owner seemingly missed is that people will not be able to see the password as it is hashed and the variables are not set to public, basically \u201csecurity through obscurity\u201d. Now, everything on the Ethereum network is public, and we could of course retrieve the password when it is sent to set up the wallet, as indicated by the transaction below:Ropsten Transaction 0xce6488a8eb2344810738b312d5fbb5884e861efa6dc4eff3486ca66ad3804a94Ropsten (ETH) detailed transaction info for 0xce6488a8eb2344810738b312d5fbb5884e861efa6dc4eff3486ca66ad3804a94ropsten.etherscan.ioGetting the transaction data parameters.The password in hex is 7468697369736d7970617373776f726400000000000000000000000000000000 (padded to 32 bytes), which is simply:\u201cthisismypassword\u201d indeed.Awesome! It does look like we could exploit the contract and attempt to drain its balance. It does look like we need to send 1 ETH with our transaction, but we will be getting it back as indicated by the code below (yea, right):You\u2019ll get your money back. I promise!The unfortunate attacker then sends the transaction\u2026.Sending the transaction with the password.And gets nothing back. And a couple minutes later two internal transaction appears, draining all ETH from the contract, leaving the attacker 1 ETH poorer.Internal transactions indicating the contract being drained, this time, correctly.So what really happened here? This contract is intentionally engineered with the below properties to exploit attackers:Liberal use of \u201cif\u201d statements so transactions do look as though they have successfully executed, when in reality does not fulfill the criteria required. On the other hand require() would throw a revert and it would be clear as day the password is wrong. This allows the contract to look a lot more innocent, potentially tricking multiple attackers.Written naively to trick attackers into thinking it is badly written code by a new developer who does not know what he or she is doing.And this is the important bit \u2014 Etherscan presently do not show cross-contract calls which sends 0 value. So contracts could execute state changes, but as long as no value is sent, it will not show up on the transaction list.Contract 0xA2D98d20eB3496ABb3Ab59D8E90AD069FCF30b59 is the culprit, originally set up to execute a call per point 3 above. This is done through this transaction:Ropsten Transaction 0x7f6ecbfa4511d078ebd21c02d2eb83657cb38599086fb6eaf75d603519f98662Ropsten (ETH) detailed transaction info for 0x7f6ecbfa4511d078ebd21c02d2eb83657cb38599086fb6eaf75d603519f98662ropsten.etherscan.ioThe real setup() call.If we load up the Parity trace for this transaction, we can very quickly see this transaction in fact does two calls, the first headed to the contract 0xA2D9\u2026b59, resulting in an internal call which calls our wallet contract on 0xE668\u2026cfC:An internal transaction call.Notice the block number being 4516435, which is before transaction 0xce6488\u2026\u2026.804a94 done on block 4516438!4516435 vs 4516438And as setup checks if hashedpassword has already been initialised, the password would NOT be \u201cthisismypassword\u201d but whatever password which the attacker has already preemptively set previously.Notice hashedpassword == 0x0And to confirm this, let\u2019s check the storage:Oh my.The hashedpassword is not keccak256(\u201cthisismypassword\u201d), neither is the owner 0xd77e\u2026ea8 per transaction 0xce6488\u2026\u2026.804a94!In this case this is how the exploit contract looks like. Note that executeExploit passed 1 ETH and hence appearing on the internal tx list, however could be made similar to the above as it is the true owner anyhow, which obscures the attack sequence slightly more.Execution of exploit.And if you\u2019re interested, there\u2019s more to read:https://medium.com/@gerhard.wagner/the-phenomena-of-smart-contract-honeypots-755c1f943f7bhttps://medium.com/coinmonks/an-analysis-of-a-couple-ethereum-honeypot-contracts-5c07c95b0a8d", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Smart Contracts", "Exploit", "Honeypot"]}, {"title": "Is Ethereum hashrate tracking the price?", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@akhounov/is-ethereum-hashrate-tracking-the-price-31f770aa5120?source=search_post", "author_name": "Alexey Akhunov", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@akhounov", "publish_date": "2017-05-03", "last_modified_date": "2018-04-11", "readtime": "1.52", "claps": 4, "voters": 4, "content": "Is Ethereum hashrate tracking the price?Alexey AkhunovFollowMay 3, 2017 \u00b7 2 min readI have seen some debates about this lately.

But it would have just swapped the colors of the lines. I plotted the prices instead because people relate to price numbers much better than to hash rate numbers.

This time we want to reveal a mechanism which will handle the Seed process, and the code.Seed round is based on a Smart Contract, which will run on Ethereum network. With this technology we choose transparency, which is going to be among key values of Mysterium Network team.The goal of this blog post is to share the Seed round logic and get your feedback.We want to be sure we are fair to our participants with these terms. Your feedback would very valuable before the start of Seed Round.History shows us that security should be taken seriously. So we want to ask technical people \u2014 help us, please take a look at the code and help us identify any potential issues. We have been testing and refining it for some time, but additional expertise, might help to identify an unwanted feature.Seed Round termsMinimum goal: 2000 EthersMaximum goal: 6000 Ethersstart date: (soon to be decided)end date: 2017\u201302\u2013xxparticipants will be able to send Ethers to the Smart Contract during Seed period, until maximum goal is reached.Seed period is defined by Ethereum blocks: [start block] to [end block]. (We will calculate approximate block numbers for specified dates before smart contract is published.)Smart Contract will lock collected funds until minimum goal is reached.In case of failure: if [Minimum goal] is not reached before [End Date] \u2014 all funds will be returned. Seed participants will be able to refund their Ethers during 2 month window. This can be done by calling function refund(). After 2 month window all un-claimed funds will be sent to [Mysterium Project Wallet];In case of success: if [Minimum goal] is reached before [End Date] \u2014 all funds will be unlocked. We will be able to send those funds to [Mysterium project wallet]. This will be done by calling function transfer_funds_to_project(), which can be invoked by anyone.By sending Ethers to this smart contract \u2014 you will automatically participate in the Seed Round, your Ether address and amount of Ethers will be written into blockchain. This will be public information as everyone can check it. We will use these records to reward you with Mysterium coins once ICO is over, read here about 5x reward for early participation.Smart Contract address will be published as soon as we deploy contract to live Ethereum network on several places, including our website, medium blog, twitter. We will publish details on how to participate in Seed round in further blog posts.Please find contract code on github: https://github.com/MysteriumNetwork/Contracts/blob/master/Presale.solSmart Contract has been tested with unit test by using Truffle and on Ethereum Test Network.Your ThoughtsIf you can verify our code, let us know what you think of it?Do you think these are fair rules?

There is no difference between tokens bought in ICO and on the exchange.Will conversion be automatic?No. Conversion will require user action. First, you will need to create ADS wallet. Then you will receive instruction on where to send ADST to burn it. After you complete ADST transfer, you will be granted ADS with an amount proportional to the amount of burned ADST.Can I still hold ADST after blockchain is released?Yes. ADS will be listed on the separate market. ADST will still be traded. Arbitrageurs will make sure that ADST and ADS price will trade in line, so there is no risk in holding ADST.So why should I switch to ADS?Only ADS will receive dividends from fees collected from transactions in the new blockchain. Just ADS can be used to buy and sell ADS. ADS market will more likely be more liquid.Will ADST tokens on exchanges be automatically converted?ADST will continue to trade and won\u2019t be automatically converted. We will work with exchanges to provide one-click conversion for ADST tokens on the exchanges. At very least you will be able just to sell ADST and buy ADS without any problems.Will the supply stay the same after conversion?As written in the whitepaper there will be additional supply (50%)for devs and pre-ico investors granted in the new blockchain. Quantity will, therefore, be doubled. There are currently 19,379,103 ADST, so there will be 38,758,206 ADS created in genesis block. 19,379,103 ADS will be locked-in to handle conversions. The other half will be held for pre-ico investors and team incentives.What about conversion ratio. I heard it is going to be 1:10? Is it going to be bad for token holders?It is an entirely meaningless technical detail that will not affect market cap or value of tokens you hold. There is no difference between keeping 100 tokens $1 each and 1000 token $0.10 each.If it doesn\u2019t change anything why do it?According to our analysis tokens priced below $1.00 have the greater liquidity, are most comfortable to use and will make the growth of our platform faster.What about listing on more exchanges?This is a top priority for us.

It has a clean interface and many powerful functions, just like the etherscan.io on EOS. If you want to check your EOS token balance, transactions records, you can use EOSPark by simply entering your EOS username or EOS Public Key into the search field. Also EOSPark.com allows you to check any EOS accounts, blocks, smart contracts, and all of your EOS airdrops.And I was shocked when I visited EOSPark.com and saw a more beatiful clean interface that shows all you would expect from an EOS block explorer.The most exciting change is they have added a menu called \u201cPark\u201d on navigation bar on EOSPark.com. So I can find any pages and try any functions in just one click. And not untill today did I just realize the reason why they introduce themselves a powerful EOS block explorer. So far I haven\u2019t seen a more powerful EOS block explorer like EOSPark.com.I also noticed that it\u2019s so easy to check contract informations such as consistency verify status, security audit status and latest deploy date by entering Contract List page. Especially for those Inconsistent Contracts that we should pay more attention to.And I saw they released new functions: 14 languages translated, alfred extension developed (This is so cool since I use Alfred to search everyday), inline action check supported (I\u2019m not a technique man and I don\u2019t understand this much, appreciate anyone can explain to me) and etc., these new upgrades are awsome and I got these informations from their Twitter.[https://twitter.com/eospark_com]It seems EOSPark really care about security of smart contract and EOS account since I saw they launched contract source code verification first, and upgrade the service to security audit then. I saw the EOSPark SEC platform has been released these days.In my opinion, security risks is our top concern no matter using account or using smart contract. I\u2019m glad to see security platforms integrated with EOSPark.Can\u2019t wait to see more upgrades of EOSPark.com, and I really love this amazing tool now.If you haven\u2019t used this tool before, I highly recommend it. In one word, eospark.com is a great EOS tool that you must try, and I believe it will become your favorite one soon once tried!Thanks for reading. How do you like it?

Thanks again to Etherscan for this.Previously when the Token Sale was started, we wrote a simple guide on checking your HGT balance. Little did we know that we would have to redo a different set of steps for the GBT too!A lot of complicated thinking went into the design of HelloGold\u2019s Gold Backed Token. We had to ensure that tokens could be allocated quickly and accurately no matter how many HGT holders there are. As a result, no transfer events occur when the bonus GBT are allocated (we get to save on tons of Gas, yay!)On the flipside, it appears that some wallets do not manage to track GBT very well. We will soon deploy a means of checking your balance from the HelloGold.org web page. In the meantime, here is a quick guide on how to check your GBT balance:These two methods work ALL the timeA. Check the GBT contract on EtherscanGo to the GBT \u201cRead Smart Contract\u201d pageEnter your wallet address in row 9 (balanceOf) and click the Query button \u2014 you should see something like this:Getting the GBT balance from etherscan\u2019s GBT pageNote: The number shown will be be in fractions of a GBT. There are 18 decimal places (e.g. 257274054777242 means 0.000257274054777242 GBT)B. Check MyEtherWalletIf you have a hardware wallet or are in control of your keys, MyEtherWallet will show you your GBT balance.Go to MyEtherWallet (the real one!)Select Send Ether and Tokens and open your walletClick on Load Token BalancesClick on Show Tokens. Your GBT balance will be shown when it is loaded.first loading\u2026. and thenthe balances are loaded one by one\u2026 and up pops GBT.Using Blockchain ExplorersThe following two methods work if you have recently transferred tokens into or out of your account. To test that, we sent 0 GBT to the same account. The action of receiving the transfer event causes the block explorers to realise that you have these coins and update the balance.An odd thing to do but we did it with a gas price of 1 GWei\u2026.C. Ethplorer \u2014 updated balance availableIt seems that once Ethplorer is aware of the existence of GBT in your account, it will check your GBT balance each time you make the request. This means that the balance shown will include any charged management fees and recent GBT bonus allocations.IMPORTANT: Due to the above, the balance you see on Ethplorer is the accurate one compared to EtherscanEthplorer has them now!D. Etherscan\u2019s account page (may not be latest balance)This is the page you get when you enter your account\u2019s address in the search box. What we have to remember is that Etherscan works by analysing blockchain entries.The account page shows a little box with your tokens. For Etherscan it shows your balance at time of last transfer. For most tokens this is perfectly fine but GBT may have new allocations and will certainly have incurred management fees.At the time of writing, Etherscan does not check the account balance at the moment you make the request.Check Etherscan for your account balance. You just enter your address into the search box and, in the drop list with the tokens you will see:And look!!!! Here are our GBT now :-)UPDATEWee Chuan of Etherscan pointed out this way of checking your GBT balance :https://etherscan.io/token/0x7585F835ae2d522722d2684323a0ba83401f32f5?a=YOUR_ADDRESSThis tells you the current GBT value AND adds GBT to your token list.So, to check the account of our dear friend Alice :https://etherscan.io/token/0x7585F835ae2d522722d2684323a0ba83401f32f5?a=0x31EFd75bc0b5fbafc6015Bd50590f4fDab6a3F22Which shows :E. Other walletsMistTo add tokens to Mist you need to add custom tokens just as you did for HGT.The contract address is 0x7585F835ae2d522722d2684323a0ba83401f32f5.ImTokenWe have communicated with the imToken team on adding GBT to the wallet and will update as soon as we receive confirmation from them.ParityParity currently does not support GBT. We hope to resolve this soon.Footnote:I would like to thank you all for supporting HelloGold and our mission to help ordinary people get access to the kind of savings that were previously only available to the affluent.Whatever your reasons were, please tell others about our mission at HelloGold and encourage people to give us a try.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Myetherwallet", "Etherscan", "Ethplorer", "Hellogold"]}, {"title": "", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@kwaazaar/wouldnt-it-be-possible-to-directly-invoke-initmultiowned-since-it-doesn-t-specify-an-access-74032bf2bab9?source=search_post", "author_name": "Robert te Kaat", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@kwaazaar", "publish_date": "2017-09-13", "last_modified_date": "2018-03-12", "readtime": "0.21", "claps": 9, "voters": 4, "content": "How I Snatched 153,037 ETH After A Bad Tinder Date6.6K272Mitch BrennerRobert te KaatFollowSep 13, 2017 \u00b7 1 min readWouldn\u2019t it be possible to directly invoke initMultiowned, since it doesn\u2019t specify an access modifier as well?https://etherscan.io/address/0x91efffb9c6cd3a66474688d0a48aa6ecfe515aa5#code \u2014 line 107:function initMultiowned(address[] _owners, uint _required) { m_numOwners = _owners.length ; m_required = _required;for (uint i = 0; i < _owners.length; ++i) { m_owners[1 + i] = uint(_owners[i]); m_ownerIndex[uint(_owners[i])] = 1 + i; } }", "responses": 0, "tags": []}, {"title": "Tokens burned!

Now before you want to delve deep and start looking for good dapp projects to get your hands on, you probably need to know more about how to navigate and manage your activities on the blockchain.As for now, most decentralized applications are built on the Ethereum Blockchain; therefore, this article will introduce you to Etherscan.io, a useful tool that allows you to explore and search the Ethereum blockchain for transactions, addresses, tokens, prices, and other activities taking place on Ethereum.What is Etherscan.io?Etherscan.io is the leading Block Explorer where users can lookup, confirm, and validate transactions that have taken place on the Ethereum Blockchain. Just like other dapps, Etherscan is also underpinned by the Ethereum Network. It has been widely used by the industry as the basic tool for data query and data analysis on the blockchain.What can we get from this site?At a glance, the site is full of strings and confusing terms that might seem overwhelming. However, once you understand it, you will feel attached to it.Read an Ethereum TransactionJust like one can track their packages on Amazon.com, the primary function of Etherscan is allowing people to check the historical transactions. Just enter your address into the search box, you can view the balance, Ether value, as well as all the transactions made through this address.Now let\u2019s click on a random \u201cTxHash\u201d to see the details of a transaction.Breaking down the data displayed:TxHash: Also known as the transaction ID, TxHash is a unique identifier generated when a transaction is performed. It can be used to track and trace the status of a transaction.Block Height: The block number in which the transaction was included.TimeStamp: The time the transaction entered the blockchain (i.e., the time the block was mined).From / To: The sending and receiving Ethereum addresses.Value: How much ETH was sent and its equivalent USD value.Gas Limit: The maximum amount of gas the sender is willing to buy for the transaction.Gas Used by Txn: The actual amount of gas used for the transaction.Gas Price: The price of gas in ETH. The gas price is decided by miners and measured in Gwei.Actual Tx Cost/Fee: Gas used x gas cost in USD value.Notice that you can also check out different types of transfer events by clicking on the \u201cInternal Txns\u201d, \u201cERC20 Token Txns\u201d and \u201cERC721 Token Txns\u201d tabs.Smart Contract TrackerAll Ethereum dapps run on Smart Contracts, self-executing contracts with terms of the agreement being directly written into lines of code. Compared to normal addresses, transaction activities in these Smart Contracts are good indicators of a dapp\u2019s level of activity. Based on the transaction records of dapp\u2019s Smart Contracts, dapp.com ranking further processes and visualizes this information eventually provides an easy-to-read index to assess the health and growth potential of dapp projects.For some experts who know how to read the code, a click on the \u201cCode\u201d tab can also give you full access to the contract code, where you can take a closer look at the transaction rulesets enforced in the code.(Read more: Smart Contracts Definition | Investopedia )ERC721 Token TrackerAt its very core, blockchain provides a platform that ensures there can be only one digital copy of something, making every crypto item unique, with its own associated value. CryptoKitties, Etheremon, Exoplanets, Gods Unchained, etc., all these popular dapps you might have heard of creating digital one-of-a-kind collectibles on top of the blockchain. Hence, the ERC721 token tracking tool could also give you a general view, in particular, of a dapp collectible\u2019s activity level. Let\u2019s take a look at what are popular crypto collectibles these days.Gas price trackerAnother useful feature this website has is the gas price tracker. Ethereum Smart Contracts, as well as the network having congestion issues, is nothing new. The congestion can inflate gas prices, raise transaction costs and cause fails in transactions. Since a cheaper gas means a cheaper cost of running and using dapps, it is strongly recommended to check the gas price tracker and adjust the gas fee before confirming a transaction.There are other Ethereum gas price trackers such as Ether Gas Station, Gitcoin, and more.Charts and StatsIf you want to get a full picture of the Ethereum Network, Ether Market will over time allow you to start doing your own analysis, \u201cCharts and Stats\u201d would be an important place to start with.In a nutshell, Etherscan is a resourceful database for all the Ethereum Network users to track transactions, check on smart contracts and tokens, monitor the gas price, read charts and stats, and much more. As more promising dapp projects are coming out, this one-stop website could be a practical tool to help you stay on top of the Ethereum Blockchain. Of course, this site is not perfect, compared to its data tracking functions, some other resources such as contents in \u201cEthereum Dictionary\u201d needs updating and supplements. Use this site wisely, it will definitely make your Ethereum Blockchain experience easier and more enjoyable.If you\u2019re interested in exploring the potential of blockchain and decentralized technology, Dapp.com is a source of inspiration, tools and information you can trust.\u25ba Visit our website here: https://www.dapp.com/\u2014Follow us online here:https://www.dapp.com/article/A-Useful-Tool-to-Better-Navigate-on-the-Ethereum-Blockchain-EtherscanFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/dappdotcom/Twitter: https://twitter.com/dapp_comInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dapp_com/LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/dapp-com/Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/dapp_com/Telegram: https://t.me/dapp_com", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Dapps", "Tools"]}, {"title": "", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@meowent/%E7%99%BC%E5%87%BA%E5%8E%BB%E4%BA%86%E6%89%8D%E7%9C%8B%E5%88%B0%E9%80%99%E7%AF%87t-t-%E6%84%9F%E8%AC%9D%E5%A4%A7%E5%A4%A7%E7%84%A1%E7%A7%81%E5%9C%B0%E5%88%86%E4%BA%AB-1d4afcef327b?source=search_post", "author_name": "Wen Chang", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@meowent", "publish_date": "2019-01-14", "last_modified_date": "2019-01-14", "readtime": "0.60", "claps": 1, "voters": 1, "content": "\u6df1\u5165\u89e3\u6790Solidity\u5408\u7d043334yaohsinWen ChangFollowJan 14 \u00b7 1 min read\u767c\u51fa\u53bb\u4e86\u624d\u770b\u5230\u9019\u7bc7T_T\uff0c\u611f\u8b1d\u5927\u5927\u7121\u79c1\u5730\u5206\u4eabhttps://etherscan.io/address/0xe6bb2220819569b8e9d8265c49ca6c79e15a1559\u96d6\u7136\u53ea\u662f\u597d\u5947\uff0c\u4f46\u9084\u662f\u5fcd\u4e0d\u4f4f\u60f3\u8acb\u554f\u4e0b\uff0c\u5305\u542b blockhash\u7b49\u7b49solidity\u7684 block property\uff0c\u662f\u5728\u8a72\u5340\u584a\u7522\u751f\u5f8c\u624d\u7528\u90a3\u4e9b\u53c3\u6578\u53bb\u57f7\u884ctransection\u7684\u55ce\uff1f\u90a3\u9019\u6a23\u5b50\u5982\u679c\u88e1\u9762\u542b\u6709\u5224\u65b7\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982 uint number = block.timestamp % 6; if(number ==0 ) {dice.bet\u2026}\u5728\u5305\u51fa\u5408\u6cd5\u5340\u584a\u5730\u7576\u4e0b\uff0c\u8a72\u7bc0\u9ede\u7522\u751f\u7684\u8a08\u7b97\u8a73\u7d30\u6d41\u7a0b\u662f\u600e\u9ebc\u8d70\u7684\u5462(\u611f\u89ba\u6703\u6709\u905e\u8ff4\u554f\u984c\u7684\u8a71\u662f\u54ea\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u60f3\u6cd5\u8981\u4fee\u6b63)", "responses": 1, "tags": []}, {"title": "", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@lrqstudy/i-have-some-trobule-with-my-icn-1fd0c38b5982?source=search_post", "author_name": "Justin Lee", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@lrqstudy", "publish_date": "2016-10-28", "last_modified_date": "2017-08-31", "readtime": "0.25", "claps": 1, "voters": 1, "content": "HOW-TO Buy Or Sell ICN On Kraken Exchange515Jaka MeleJustin LeeFollowOct 28, 2016 \u00b7 1 min readI have some trobule with my icn.

The one that fails doesn\u2019t have any ETH in it but does that matter?You can check the transactions here:https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0xc7e5bd1e1b91b9f63b51934d7e6a76e778a2beb9A similar thing happens with the contract that we created yesterday. I am only able to send tokens successfully to one account only. Funnily, it\u2019s the one that fails with the other token but works with the one we created.You can check it out here:https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x631139b4217b851a5990066dc56137fcd1b52bd0*Update: sending tokens from MEW seem to be working well for multiple addresses. Could this be a Metamask problem?-Double spendingCould you please explain again how you think is best to prevent double spending (of the token) and what kind of code do we need to include in the crowdsale (and token) contracts?- Deploying on mainnetOverall, is the process of building and deploying a contract to mainnet more or less the same as the one we did? If different, what is different?How much would it cost, roughly, to deploy a token like the one we created on mainnet?- Verifying and publishing the contract we created on EtherscanAfter our call, I copied and pasted all the files in one single txt doc which I then copied into the field on Etherscan to verify but did not work.I got an error saying it couldn\u2019t find info about the constructor in ABI format. I didn\u2019t know where to get that one.How can I verify when deploying from Remix?As a side note, later I deployed the same contract (the one we built) with truffle from Terminal and was able to verify it after flattening the files with truffle-flattener. So, at least I know one way of doing it :)- initialSupply \u2014 decimalsI know that when I put 10 decimals, I can send 0.0000000001 of the token.But can you please explain this below.

Anyway, this code is supposed to incorporate a transfer ownership function, so anyone can buy tokens directly by sending ETH to the contract\u2019s address. And supposedly the token can be listed on exchanges.Looking at the code, do you think that is the case?Related to the crowdsale, we were talking about, is there a way to incorporate such a function in the token code?- Why did we get rid of string memory in our code yesterday?- Implementing with truffle, I had to change var to const in \u201cinitial migrations\u201d (as per instructions)Do you have any idea why that is?const Migrations = artifacts.require(\u201cMigrations\u201d);module.exports = function(deployer) { deployer.deploy(Migrations);};- Slightly offtopicIs there a way to link token minting to specific user actions \u2014 clucking on a link, registering on a site, spending a given amount of time or making a download/purchase?", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Ethereum"]}, {"title": "", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@maxwellbruno52/i-thought-the-wallet-you-were-referring-to-included-metamask-7bff45729651?source=search_post", "author_name": "Maxwell Bruno", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@maxwellbruno52", "publish_date": "2019-03-03", "last_modified_date": "2019-03-03", "readtime": "0.20", "claps": 1, "voters": 1, "content": "V3: The Final BOMB (Token Swap)6962Zachary DashMaxwell BrunoFollowMar 3 \u00b7 1 min readI thought the Wallet you were referring to included Metamask ?

For EUR 50ct that would be \u20ac486,725.86.The first transaction after the opening window at EPOCH 1553691602 amounted to 72245.0000 GET, ~\u20ac36,122.50 at EUR 50ct. A bit more than the \u20ac36,055.40 you were looking for.I have two questions. As the transaction was more than the buyback amount, does this mean the transaction is invalid and will be sent back to the sender. If not, does this mean only one person was able to join in on the buyback?Etherscan: https://etherscan.io/token/0x8a854288a5976036a725879164ca3e91d30c6a1b?a=0x7c8041c91439539e5e2e67493d63047b1515a7c8", "responses": 1, "tags": []}, {"title": "", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@wafflemakr/definitely-great-bb83567afc79?source=search_post", "author_name": "Waffle Maker", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@wafflemakr", "publish_date": "2019-02-20", "last_modified_date": "2019-02-20", "readtime": "0.29", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "\u201cWriter\u2019s Note: It is possible to do all this for mobile using react-native although some shimming\u202621Fairiz AziziWaffle MakerFollowFeb 20 \u00b7 1 min readDefinitely great!

Data from EtherScan reveals that the first time this happened was on December 29, 2017, (during the bull run) and the last time was February 1, 2018, (when the bull run was coming to an end). This is a huge moment for the community as it shows that Ethereum is managing to gain the attention of day-traders. It may also be a sign of an imminent upwards trend in price.While on the surface, this seems like a hugely positive sign, there is also a possibility that this has happened for unsavory reasons. A cryptocurrency enthusiast on Twitter pointed out that during May 4, 2018, one Ethereum address was accounting for almost 50% of all transactions. This address was revealed to be linked to Binance, suggesting that the exchange has been handling large amounts of transactions in an inefficient manner. It is possible that this is caused by Binance\u2019s new feature that converts \u2018dust\u2019 into BNB.Ordinarily, one address accounting for 50% of all transactions would not be too large of a problem (although it does suggest a level of centralization). Perhaps the real issue here is that Binance may not be using Ethereum gas efficiently to facilitate their transactions. Gas is the tool that allows Ethereum to run smoothly and cheaply. It is needed to process all ether transactions. If the reason why 50% of transactions were derived from Binance was due to the \u2018dust\u2019 to BNB feature, then it suggests that the company is hurting Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem. When gas is misused it raises the prices of transactions for all users. It can also seriously slow down the blockchain.Since May 4, it appears that the amount of transactions per day has returned to a more common number, and has moved away from 1 million \u2014 suggesting that Binance has seen the error they made and have rectified it. A visit to EtherGasStation also reveals that Binance\u2019s addresses are no longer making up nearly 50% of transactions.Originally published at cryptodisrupt.com on May 8, 2018.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Blockchain", "Cryptocurrency", "Smart Contracts", "Technology"]}, {"title": "", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@leh50836/where-is-smartcontract-address-b8c7cb1a80f5?source=search_post", "author_name": "Le Hoang", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@leh50836", "publish_date": "2018-01-10", "last_modified_date": "2018-01-10", "readtime": "0.29", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "If we are in an ICO Bublle, people will need to find safe habors \u2014 Part 11EZToken RewardsLe HoangFollowJan 10, 2018 \u00b7 1 min readWhere is SmartContract Address ?I do check your token symbol on https://etherscan.io/token-search but fond nothing.It looks like you don\u2019t deploy any smartcontract for your ICO.You told me that you are going to build an internal market exchange.And you are already release your wallet.I try to ask on your support channel (facebook/telegram) and what I got is Kicked.I do check your github and it just only upload a few hour.https://github.com/ezpos/eztoken-contract/tree/master/contracts", "responses": 0, "tags": []}, {"title": "", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@ajiriobibi7/how-to-buy-hitex-b489e077bf09?source=search_post", "author_name": "Obibi Ajirioghene", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@ajiriobibi7", "publish_date": "2018-10-06", "last_modified_date": "2018-10-06", "readtime": "0.41", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "Obibi AjiriogheneFollowOct 6, 2018 \u00b7 1 min readHow To Buy HITEX?Contract Address : https://etherscan.io/address/0x8b94010808f615cf379b36d02bbfbbf454759fe3Token Name : HitexExchangeToken Token SYMBOL : HITEX Token Decimal : 8 Protocol : ERC20 Tokens per ETH : 7,000,000 HITEX Min ETH (0.01) : 70,000 HITEX Gas : 150,000 Gwei : please check https://ethgasstation.info/ for more information regarding the current required gas price.
