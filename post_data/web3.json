To understand this, it\u2019s necessary to travel back in time and examine it predecessors, Web 1.0 & 2.0.Just like the Middle Ages, the Web 1.0 wasn\u2019t given its name until it bit the dust. The \u2018World Wide Web\u2019 as it was known, was just a set of static websites with a load of information and no interactive content. Connecting meant dialing up through rickety modems and blocking anyone in the house from using the phone. It was the web of AOL chat rooms and MSN messenger, of AltaVista and Ask Jeeves. It was maddeningly slow. Streaming videos and music? Forget it. Downloading a song would take at least a day.And then there was 2.0The memory of bleepy modems and boring interfaces has largely floated away. Faster internet speeds paved the way for interactive content, the web wasn\u2019t about observing anymore, it was about participating. The global sharing of information spawned the age of \u2018Social Media\u2019. Youtube, Wikipedia, Flickr and Facebook gave voices to the voiceless and a means for like-minded communities to thrive.Publishing this blog post will take me a hassle-free 30 seconds, an immeasurable improvement from when it took a concerted effort between designers, developers and administrators just to make a simple website edit. We could call this the Read-Write-Publish\u2019 era \u2014 where the spread of information is as simple as those three words. So it begs the question, the web 2.0 is great, what went wrong?Information is moneyThe UN estimated internet users increased from 738 million to 3.2 billion from 2000\u20132015. That\u2019s an unfathomable amount of data floating around, and as big digital corporations realized, personal information is an enormously valuable asset. So began the mass stockpiling of data in centralized servers, with Amazon, Facebook and Twitter the biggest custodians. People sacrificed security for the convenience of these services; whether they knew it or not, their identities, browsing habits, searches and online shopping information was sold to the highest bidder.The 3.0 revolutionBy this stage, Web 2.0 exponents were already dreaming up a successor. The next web, they envisaged, would take nostalgic turn to the vision of the web 1.0: more \u2018human\u2019 and more privacy. Rather than concentrating the power (and data) in the hands of huge behemoths with questionable motives, it would be returned the rightful owners.The vision of a fairer and more transparent web dates back to around 2006, but the tools and technologies weren\u2019t available for it to materialize. Bitcoin was still three years off, bringing with it the notion of a distributed ledger, or blockchain, for peer-to-peer digital storage. Decentralization was the idea; blockchain was the means. Now we have what is described as human-centered internet.The pro-privacy, anti-monopoly webWhile the Web 2.0 democratized many power structures and created new opportunities, the economic engine is largely privatized and monopolized. Facebook, Uber and AirBnB have created private networks for public infrastructure which they dominate. The Web 3.0 is the antithesis of this, it\u2019s about multiple profit centers sharing value across an open network.It\u2019s easy to envision a not-too-distant future where crypto-based phones, VPN\u2019s, decentralized storage and cryptocurrency wallets are widespread. A future without the need of network and cellular providers that suspend or surveil our information. If we\u2019re to avoid sleep-walking into a Black Mirror style privacy dystopia, these are the tools we require. There are a number of advantages that Web 3.0 offers:No central point of control: Middlemen are removed from the equation, blockchains like Ethereum provide a trust-less platform where the rules are unbreakable and data is fully encrypted. Alphabet and Apple will no longer have control of user data. No government or entity will have the ability to kill sites and services; and no single individual can control the identities of others.Ownership of data: End users will regain complete control of data and have the security of encryption. Information can then be shared on a case-by-case and permissioned basis. At present, big companies like Amazon and Facebook have factories of servers storing information on dietary preferences, income, interests, credit card details and more. It\u2019s not merely to improve their services \u2014 marketers and advertisers pay billions each year for the data.Dramatic reduction in hacks and data breaches: Because data will be decentralized and distributed, hackers would need to turn off the entire network, while state-sponsored tools such as Vault7, used by the three-letter agencies, would be rendered obsolete. At present, internet companies are compelled to hand over user data or succumb to having the entire database scrutinized. These data intrusions aren\u2019t just limited to major security threats such as terrorism; in 2017, Coinbase took the IRS to court over its demand to see the data of over 15,000 customers.The cost of data breaches is projected to surpass $2.1 trillion US dollars by 2019.The case, which Coinbase eventually lost, paved the way for government entities to pick over the finances of thousands of customers, with little due cause to justify the intrusion. Cases like this are unfortunately not isolated; in 2013 secure email provider Lavabit chose to shut down rather than hand its SSL keys over to the US government so it could surveil Edward Snowden.Interoperability: Applications will be easy to customize and device-agnostic, capable of running on smartphones, TVs, automobiles, microwaves and smart sensors. At present, applications are OS-specific, and are often limited to a single operating system. For instance, many Android cryptocurrency wallets are unavailable on iOs, causing frustration for consumers who use multiple devices. It adds expenses for developers tasked with issuing multiple iterations and updates of their software.Permissionless blockchains: Anyone can create an address and interact with the network. The power to access permissionless chains cannot be overstated. Users will not be barred on account of geography, income, gender, orientation or a host of other sociological and demographic factors. Wealth and other digital assets can be transferred cross-border, quickly and efficiently, anywhere in the world.Uninterrupted service: Account suspension and distributed denial of service are dramatically reduced. Because there\u2019s no single point of failure, service disruption will be minimal. Data will be stored on distributed nodes to ensure redundancy and multiple backups will prevent server failure or seizure.How will it work?Like any emerging technology is still being refined. For access to the decentralized web, people will only need a seed. This will be a single asset which enables the interaction with dApps and other services. Individuals will still use a web browser to access the internet, and visually it will be Web 2.0 user-friendly.On the surface, the learning curve from 2.0 to 3.0 will be gentle. But behind the scenes, the framework connecting users with digital services are markedly different. Transactions are signed and verified manually, to prevent platforms from siphoning away personal information without due cause. Web users will opt in rather than trying \u2014 and often failing \u2014 to opt out.Instead of Google Drive or Dropbox, we have services like Storj, Siacoin, Filecoin or IPFS technology to distribute and store files.Instead of Skype we have platforms like Experty.io.Instead of WhatsApp and Wechat we have StatusInstead of operating systems such as iOS and Android, frameworks such as Essentia.one and EOS provide a gateway to the new web.Akasha or Steemit will play the role of Facebook, the Brave browser will serve as Chrome and Ethlance can take over from Upwork.Web 2.0 > Web 3.0These are just a few examples. As the Web 3.0 rears into action, new platforms will emerge with a healthy level of competition not throttled by monopolistic service providers. It\u2019s likely the best dApps and decentralized services we will use three years from now are no more than a glimmer in a developers eye.The concept goes as follows: at present the decentralized apps, wallets, platforms, and other digital assets that make up Web 3.0 are scattered. Accessing these interfaces calls for separate seeds, logins, and identities \u2014 much like the existing Web 2.0. Essentia.one will link these disparate platforms together via a single seed. Because this will operate as an encrypted key that can be associated with its owner, Essentia will provide proof of identity but without giving up any more of that individual\u2019s identity than is necessary.Just as the Web 2.0 didn\u2019t automatically extinguish Web 1.0 (still gathering dust around some parts of the internet), the move to 3.0 will take time and integration with existing online systems. The wheels have already been set in motion and the train has left the station. Web 3.0 is an revolution in motion, we are past the point of no return.The change can\u2019t happened without your help: spread around the voice or share the article.Personal Bio, Twitter, FacebookDon\u2019t miss the latest updates about our projects by subscribing to the newsletter.", "responses": 165, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Web3", "Ethereum", "Essentiaone", "Bitcoin"]}, {"title": "Why the net giants are worried about the Web 3.0", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@matteozago/why-the-net-giants-are-worried-about-the-web-3-0-44b2d3620da5?source=search_post---------1", "author_name": "Matteo Gianpietro Zago", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@matteozago", "publish_date": "2018-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2018-12-04", "readtime": "6.32", "claps": 22776, "voters": 2729, "content": "Why the net giants are worried about the Web 3.0Matteo Gianpietro ZagoFollowMar 17, 2018 \u00b7 7 min readCalm before the stormThe birth of blockchain spawned a movement which is set to disrupt the entire tech industry. Blockchain and crypto enthusiasts are calling it the Web 3.0 and it\u2019s looking to make all traditional business models defunct. This is because, in short, the technology will facilitate the decentralization of the World Wide Web, thereby equalizing control and ownership back from the grasp of profit hungry corporations.The Web 3.0 ecosystem already consists of over 3000 variegated crypto coins and over 900 decentralized apps or DApps (a single DApp can mean a team of up to 50 members, each dedicated to disrupting a specific industry). And even though the industry is still in its infancy, the market cap has already exceeded 800 billion.Libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9These numbers supply damning evidence this movement is indeed a revolution in the works. And not unlike France in the 18th century, this revolution was born out of the frustration of inequality between millions of people and the few in power. And justly so, the Web 2.0 provided a fertile ground for corporations to monopolize control and profits.The net giants are doing nothing other than consolidating control. Take internet.org for example, Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s initiative to provide free access to the internet to deprived countries. The programmes intentions are rightly questioned as an obvious route whereby Facebook can control and discriminate access to the internet by any way they deem fit.Facebook\u2019s CEO is spending big bucks to defend his interests, and he\u2019s not the only one. Jeff Bezos\u2019s acquisition of the Washington Post is the cheapest and most subtle political insurance Amazon can buy. The price tag of $250 million beats a potential $700 billion \u2018Antitrust\u2019 case brought against the company.It all goes to prove that a more liberated, egalitarian and fraternal internet would be a cause for concern for some monarchical corporations and their leaders.Torrents of disruptionThe transition to a trust-less, anti-corruptible and anti-censorship system is not only necessary, it\u2019s inevitable, and the changes will be catastrophic. Take these sectors for example:Exchange ServicesThe cryptocurrency exchange Mt. Gox once again showed why housing data in a centralized manner is a bad idea, with over $460 million worth of bitcoin raided by hackers in 2014. Without a central governing authority, no one can adjust or float market rates and exchange values. There\u2019s no boss in charge with conflicted interests, and there\u2019s no one with more access to user data than anyone else. If we were to sum up the Web 3.0 in a word, it could be disintermediation.We are now seeing decentralized exchanges like Bitfinex and EOSfinex fill in the gap of trust by removing the \u2018central point of failure\u2019 for anyone to manipulate. Immutability allows consumers to interact directly and costly financial process can be automated via smart contracts. With the ability to perform micro and macro payments, through fast clearing times and much cheaper fees, crypto currencies and exchanges will win in the long term.StorageFile Storage Web 2.0 > Web 3.0Now DApps like Storj, Filecoin and Maidsafe are leading the way in decentralized storage systems. All pushing to reduce costs and improve security with current storage providers. They run on the premise of trading unused storage capacity across desktops, servers and storage devices in exchange for tokens on their platforms. The nodes that store data will receive a reward in return and will perpetuate the framework. It will cost a fraction of what centralized storage platforms are offering so these platforms will undoubtedly win consumers in the long term, businesses will inevitably choose cheaper methods with improved security and privacy.Messaging & Social NetworksIf you live in Turkey or China, you are accustomed to explicit censorship and restrictive content. With Erdogan blocking twitter and Xi Jingpin banning anyone comparing him to Winnie the Pooh, there is no escape. And the Western world is not exempt either. Google released a code last year which scanned every private Google doc for violations and restricted access if they deemed necessary.The demand for free speech is universal, and in the current state of internet affairs, the imbalance of power means the internet can be manipulated and blocked at a whim to benefit any corporation or governmental agency.We are beginning to see decentralized social platforms like Steemit, Akasha and Status filling the privacy void. There cannot be lawsuits demanding access or restrictions to accounts without a central body, and the content remains in the hands of the user.Insurance and BankingInsurance Web 2.0 > Web 3.0Corruption, insider trading, greed; These terms have become synonymous with insurance and banking industries. We are required to blindly trust the financial system because there are no alternatives on offer. Decisions are made behind closed doors and consumers have no say. It\u2019s not hard to see why these sectors top the bill on corporate collapses and scandals. With $182 billion worth of taxpayer bailouts, this current broken system affects everyone.Banking Web 2.0 vs Web 3.0The peer to peer industry has demonstrated how non-profit organizations can be sustainable long term. Take Mozilla or Wikipedia for example, they prove why centralized, profit-oriented governance is not necessary. But with the technology, we can go bigger. Blockchain provides an alternative where decentralized governance and trust is supplied through incorruptible smart contracts and cryptographic mathematics. The rules of the game are clear from the beginning.Video StreamingIn 2005, YouTube (now owned by Google) popularized user generated content, representing a historic change in how we interact with the internet. But as time passed, and profit objectives were required to be met, slowly but surely we saw big changes. It\u2019s considered free, but we do exchange our personal information (browsing/shopping habits) mostly unconsciously. All the while content generators only see a small percentage off the profit from advertising.Their advertising and censorship policies are vague, and many content generators argue that videos are inconsistently and unjustly demonetized. With 400 hours of content uploaded every minute, Google admitted that they \u201cdon\u2019t always get it right\u201d. So if the largest internet corporation in the world can\u2019t handle it, then it would appear that centralized control doesn\u2019t work out best for consumers.Music StreamingMusic Web 2.0 vs Web 3.0In terms of professional artists making their living of such streaming services, the 30% middleman fee cuts deep into those who are just paving their way. The decentralize web offers a better solution for streaming services where users will be the owners and beneficiaries of their content. The Web 3.0 will will make it possible to remove intermediaries and enable advertisers, viewers, and content creators to engage directly with one another.AdoptionWe can see decentralization is making tracks, but it\u2019s applications and benefits to specific industries are still largely unknown in mainstream internet audiences. The \u2018Internet of Blockchain\u2019 foundation (IBF) aims to counter exactly that. The mission is to foster adoption and push the transition to the Web 3.0; a more user-centric web where we retain complete ownership of our data, identity and digital assets.The IBF is aware how the lack of accessibility is hindering widespread adoption, hence the support for Essentia.one, a decentralized framework working to tackle this issue. The decentralized framework will be the first to bring together the decentralized ecosystem and enable interoperability between multiple blockchains. Essentia has natively integrated DApps such as Akasha, Aragon and Storj, and will provide the first, user-friendly interface for anyone to access and manage their digital lives on the Web 3.0.So why are the net giants worried? Because the abuse of power and control can only be sustained for so long. Think of King Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette as they become apparent of the revolution underfoot. This time however, it\u2019s not the people of Paris shouting libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9, it\u2019s the tech community, collectively working to facilitate the transition to a better world.Essentia as unique access to the Web 3.0The change cant happened without your help: spread around the voice or share the article.Personal Bio, Twitter, FacebookDon\u2019t miss the latest updates about our projects by subscribing to the newsletter.Web 2.0 vs Web 3.0 Comparison Map in high quality hereTimeline Arpanet to Web 3.0 in high quality hereWeb 3.0 Map only Map at this link", "responses": 105, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Bitcoin", "Ethereum", "Cryptocurrency", "Web3"]}, {"title": "Why We Need Web 3.0", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@gavofyork/why-we-need-web-3-0-5da4f2bf95ab?source=search_post---------2", "author_name": "Gavin Wood", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@gavofyork", "publish_date": "2018-09-12", "last_modified_date": "2018-09-20", "readtime": "5.75", "claps": 6652, "voters": 719, "content": "Listen to this story--:----:--Why We Need Web 3.0Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood on why today\u2019s internet is broken \u2014 and how we can do better next time aroundGavin WoodFollowSep 12, 2018 \u00b7 6 min readCredit: Rick_Jo/iStock/Getty Images PlusIt was over four years ago that I coined the term \u201cWeb 3.0.\u201d Back then, it was clear to me: Ethereum \u2014 the platform I cofounded \u2014 would allow people to interact in mutually beneficial ways without anyone needing to trust each other. With technologies for message passing and data publication, we hoped to construct a peer-to-peer web that lets you do everything you can now, except there would no servers and no authorities to manage the flow of information.These days, with key components still missing or dysfunctional, with scalability still wanting, and many projects suffering from compatibility problems, I don\u2019t always find it easy to see the light at the end of the tunnel, or how we will get there. But the important points are unchanged from before: Centralization is not socially tenable long-term, and government is too clumsy to fix things.What precisely is wrong with the web today? In short, it\u2019s a big baby. It has grown old without growing up. While connecting the far corners of the globe with a packet-switching network and hypertext platform is an incredible achievement, the web has become corrupted from its own success.The internet today is broken by design.Rewind to 1990s and the internet was a very different place. Google was still a .org domain, open-source software was being described as \u201ccancer\u201d by one of the fiercest monopolists of all time, and \u201cinformation superhighway\u201d and \u201cinternet addict\u201d were gaining traction as terms for the newly anointed. People (well, teenagers like me) still ran their own websites and email servers, and \u201cnet neutrality\u201d was something fishermen argued about when buying trawlers. The fabric of the internet was yet to become warped by the shape of society. It was still rather barebones and empowering, reflecting its academic and enthusiast roots.In the 20 years following, the \u201cWorld Wide Web\u201d would change the nature of society \u2014 this we know. Critically, though, the basic technical architecture of the internet provided no backstop against changes happening in the other direction. Society was bound to imprint itself back on the web.Technology often mirrors its past. It acts in line with the previous paradigm, only faster, harder, better, or stronger than before. As the global economy went online, we replicated the same social structures that we had before. Partly, we have the web to thank for the modern divides between rich and poor, between powerful and impotent, and between enlightened and under-informed.The internet today is broken by design. We see wealth, power and influence placed in the hands of the greedy, the megalomaniacs, or the plain malicious. Markets, institutions, and trust relationships have been transposed to this new platform, with the density, power and incumbents changed, but with the same old dynamics.Take how we pay for things online. On Web 2.0, you are not empowered to make payments per se. In reality, you must contact your financial institution to do it on your behalf. You are not trusted to do something as innocuous as pay your water bill. You are treated like a child appealing to a parent. If you wish to contact your friend online, then likely you will need to appeal to Facebook to relay your message.Technology often mirrors its past\u2026 As the global economy went online, we replicated the same social structures that we had before.The goliaths that run these services \u2014 often critical to our lives and jobs \u2014 have no (obvious) evil intent, but nor do they act with benevolence or principle. They make money from our fealty, feeding us our information, and cutting us off when inconvenient.Most of us don\u2019t fear government or corporate intrusion on our lives, but there are well-documented case where their interests are not aligned with our own. Look at Wikileaks. In 2010, a broadly respected set of journalists that publishes information generally in the public interest was targeted and cut off by major financial institutions like PayPal and Visa without any legal grounds. If you wanted to give a perfectly legal charitable donation to Wikileaks, you effectively couldn\u2019t.With so much of the world\u2019s data channelled through so few cables, the inconvenient truth is that unless we put in place open software protocols, our increasingly digital society will continue to be at risk from malicious \u201cauthorities\u201d both within society and (as in the case Russian tampering of our elections) from outside. Those who wish to protect the peaceful, liberal post-war world order need to realize: Our present digital architecture will magnify society\u2019s maladies, not limit them.Web 3.0 is an inclusive set of protocols to provide building blocks for application makers. These building blocks take the place of traditional web technologies like HTTP, AJAX and MySQL, but present a whole new way of creating applications. These technologies give the user strong and verifiable guarantees about the information they are receiving, what information they are giving away, and what they are paying and what they are receiving in return. By empowering users to act for themselves within low-barrier markets, we can ensure censorship and monopolization have fewer places to hide. Consider Web 3.0 to be an executable Magna Carta \u2014 \u201cthe foundation of the freedom of the individual against the arbitrary authority of the despot.\u201dIf society does not adopt the principles of Web 3.0 for its digital platform, it runs the risk of continued corruption and eventual failure, just as medieval feudal systems and Soviet-style communism proved untenable in a world of modern democracies.The adoption of Web 3.0 will be neither fast nor clean. With entrenched interests controlling much of our digital lifestyles, and interests often aligned between lawmakers, government and technology monopolists (consider how the NSA\u2019s Prism program enlisted the help of Facebook and Google), some jurisdictions may even attempt to make components of the new web illegal. Already Russia has outlawed bitcoin and the U.K. has expressed a (ridiculous) desire to outlaw strong cryptography.Web 3.0 is an inclusive set of protocols to provide building blocks for application makers. These building blocks take the place of traditional web technologies\u2026 but present a whole new way of creating applications.If society does not adopt the principles of Web 3.0 for its digital platform, it runs the risk of continued corruption and eventual failure, just as medieval feudal systems and Soviet-style communism proved untenable in a world of modern democracies. Aspects of this new system, including bitcoin or the InterPlanetary File System, will gain traction first, probably in niche areas, much as Linux found traction \u201cunder the radar\u201d in server backrooms. As technology matures, and traditional firms inevitably slow their innovation and treat their products as cash-cows (see Microsoft), the advantages of Web 3.0 will grow. It will be no more possible to outlaw Web 3.0 than it was for cities and countries to ban Uber, Airbnb, Grindr, and Wikipedia.From a user\u2019s point of view, Web 3.0 will look barely different from Web 2.0, at least initially. We\u2019ll see the same display technologies: HTML5, CSS, and so on. On the back-end, technologies like Polkadot \u2014 Parity\u2019s inter-chain blockchain protocol \u2014 will connect different technological threads into a single economy and \u201cmovement.\u201dWe\u2019ll use web browsers, but they might be called \u201cwallets\u201d or \u201ckey stores.\u201d Browsers (and components like hardware wallets) will represent a person\u2019s assets and identity online, allowing us to pay for something, or prove who we are, without needing to appeal to a bank or identity service. There will still be room for trusted parties, insurance outfits, backup-services and so forth. But their tasks will be commoditized and their activity verifiable. As these service providers are forced to compete in a global, open and transparent market, web users will be relieved of price-gouging and rent-seeking.Web 3.0 will engender a new global digital economy, creating new business models and markets to go with them, busting platform monopolies like Google and Facebook, and giving rise to vast levels of bottom-up innovation. Cheap government attacks on our privacy and liberty like widespread data trawling, censorship and propaganda, will become more difficult.To be sure, we can\u2019t predict the first successful use-cases of this new platform and when they might appear. As with the development of the internet before it, the timeline could be measured in decades rather than months. But when Web 3.0 emerges, it will bring a whole new meaning to the phrase \u201cthe Digital Age.\u201dFrom groundbreakers to lawbreakers, BREAKER is a new online magazine reporting on blockchain\u2019s most intriguing innovators.

L4 is actively hiring.The internet is changing again.Over the last decade internet-based services have trended towards centralization. Today, a handful of companies control the platforms we use to search for information, store our personal data, manage our online identities, and communicate publicly and privately.At the same time, a group of seemingly unrelated technologies are being developed on the fringes of the tech industry, ranging from encrypted messaging to digital money. Within that loose community, \u201cweb 3\u201d has become a catchall term for a vision of a new, better internet. An internet where payments and money are natively digital, where \u201cdecentralized\u201d applications compete with centralized ones, and where users have more control over their identity and data.However, we often struggle to articulate what this all means. How might \u201cweb 3\u201d be different from previous eras of the internet? What is \u201cdecentralization\u201d and why does it matter? How can these new technologies actually be used? We\u2019re spending years building infrastructure to make blockchains more scalable \u2014 but who will actually use that infrastructure, for what, and why should anyone care?This article attempts to explain the web 3 vision in clear, simple terms. We discuss the core animating idea behind the many projects that form web 3, and survey three key trends.This article isn\u2019t a prediction about the future. The future isn\u2019t fixed: we have to make the right choices to get the world we want. The point of this article is to describe a future that might be, a future compelling enough to be worth building, and a future clear enough that we know which direction to travel first.The web 3 reformationThe internet has gone through major generational shifts before. These expanded the performance, features, and scale of the internet. We went from plaintext websites to streaming video. We went from static web pages to full-featured applications served remotely through the browser. We went from listservs to global social networks that drive modern politics and culture.As the web matured, we grew to rely more and more on a handful of large companies. Google built the fastest and most convenient search engine, and have been rewarded with control over 74% of all search traffic. Facebook built the most popular social network, and was rewarded with control over the online identities of 2.2 billion people.Web 3 is different from previous generational shifts. At its core, web 3 isn\u2019t about speed, performance, or convenience. In fact, many web 3 applications are, at least today, slower and less convenient than existing products.Instead, web 3 is about power. It\u2019s about who has control over the technologies and applications that we use every day. It\u2019s about breaking the dynamic that has shaped the last decade of the web: the tradeoff between convenience and control. We\u2019ve become so accustomed to this dynamic that it seems inevitable: of course using the internet means being surveilled, and of course having a social media account means having my personal data sold to advertisers or worse. How could it be any other way?Web 3 rejects the premise. We can have the benefits of the internet without handing the majority of power to a minority of companies. The dynamic described above isn\u2019t an iron law of the universe, it\u2019s just a product of the technology available at the time and the choices we made along the way.\u201cWeb 3\u201d is a movement to build different technologies and make better choices. We aren\u2019t trying to replace the web, but rather keep what we like while changing its underlying structure \u2014 a reformation, not a revolution.The projects within it can seem disparate, but they all share a common theme. Web 3 is a group of technologies that restructure control over the internet. These range from financial projects (cryptocurrencies), to basic communications technology (end to end encrypted messaging), to mass consumer use-cases (open social networks and p2p markets), to critical internet infrastructure (decentralized DNS).Web 3 includes more than just cryptocurrencies, blockchains, and other products of cryptoeconomic design. It encompasses any technology that helps reform the centralized internet and lets users take back control over their digital lives. However, we believe that these technologies are the most significant contributors to the web 3 movement today, and for that reason focus on them in this article.Three trends for web 3In this article we survey three trends, and discuss how they might develop over time:First, money will become a native feature of the internet.Second, \u201cdecentralized\u201d applications will offer users new capabilities.Third, users will have more control over their digital identities and data.It\u2019s important to keep in mind that each of these are speculative. Inevitably, web 3 will include technologies and applications we can\u2019t anticipate, and the ones we discuss below will look different than we can imagine today.1. MoneyIn web 3, money is a native feature of the internet.In the past, the internet was simply a portal to the offline, traditional financial system. But cryptocurrencies are fundamentally digital \u2014 sending a transaction does not require interacting with some offline system, it only requires sending a message over the internet. We will soon live in a world where \u201cmoney\u201d is just something the internet does:Sending or receiving payments is now something that any piece of software can do, and by extension, something that can be done by any person with an internet connection and a phone.Digital payments will unlock new business models that were previously impractical. They will radically lower the costs of some transactions (e.g. cross-border remittances), enable new use-cases (e.g. machine payments), and be available to massive new markets (e.g. people who could not previously access the traditional financial system).An ecosystem of basic financial primitives \u2014 lending, derivatives, exchanges \u2014 provide the building blocks of more complex financial applications that can be used by anyone.We will create new kinds of money, as technologists explore the cryptoeconomic design space. We have only started to explore these possibilities, like protocol tokens and non-fungible digital assets.Cryptocurrency is only possible because Satoshi invented a way to support a currency and payment network without handing control to any centralized company. Bitcoin is decentralized in that it is \u201ccontrolled\u201d by a variety of actors, ranging from large mining companies, to individual node operators, to core protocol developers. All of them exert influence in different ways and to different degrees, but no individual actor has exclusive power over the network.\u201cDecentralization\u201d has become a central concept for web 3. However, it\u2019s often used more as a slogan than a precise technical description. Decentralization can refer to a huge range of possibilities. Is a platform \u201cdecentralized\u201d if it is controlled by 20 entities? 100? 10,000? What kind of decentralization are we even considering?Decentralization isn\u2019t a binary state \u2014 it\u2019s a direction along a spectrum of possibilities. Saying a system ought to be \u201cdecentralized\u201d is a little like telling an engineer that a bridge ought to be \u201cbig\u201d. No doubt, but it\u2019s not very useful information on its own \u2014 we also need to know what river you want to span and the load you need to bear.The point of web 3 isn\u2019t that all systems must be decentralized as much as possible, but rather that we are newly able to explore more points along the spectrum. The degree of decentralization that is useful or necessary will depend on the application. Bitcoin is an example of this: it is decentralized to a sufficient degree that payments are very difficult to censor and it would be very difficult to change the basic parameters of the currency, i.e. a deflationary monetary policy where the total amount of bitcoin is permanently capped. Others will attempt to create similar global currencies with other features that take advantage of decentralization, e.g. stablecoins like Dai that attempt to solve the problem of volatility.Because bitcoin was the first, it\u2019s often taken to be the only possible design for a cryptocurrency. As a result, \u201ccryptocurrency\u201d has become synonymous with particular political views about money, such as the virtue of deflationary currencies.It\u2019s important to understand that there are many possible designs for a digital currency, which might serve different purposes. Bitcoin enthusiasts believe the purpose of cryptocurrency is to allow people to opt into the enthusiast\u2019s preferred monetary policy, the superiority of which is self-evident. A more humble interpretation is that the innovation of cryptocurrencies is that people can opt into whatever monetary policy they choose, whatever that happens to be. All they need is an internet connection and a phone.2. Decentralized applications and servicesThe products and services that make up the internet today tend to be produced and controlled by individual corporations. If you use an internet-based application, there is very likely a legal entity somewhere that controls it. That company employs people to work on it, decides what features get prioritized, controls the servers that host the application\u2019s data, and ultimately determines what code gets pushed to the product.The promise of web 3 is that there might be other options. Maybe we can build products and services that are not controlled by any single company, but still have comparable usefulness to their centralized equivalents. Just as with Bitcoin, these products would be \u201cdecentralized\u201d, though the rationale for decentralization, and the benefits it offers, may be very different.Imagine, for instance, what a \u201cdecentralized publishing platform\u201d might look like. This would be a social platform like Twitter or Medium that lets users share content, comment on it, and \u201cvote\u201d for content that they like.The platform comes with built-in mechanisms to encourage users to contribute. Instead of just \u201cupvoting\u201d posts, users can send each other micropayments, or set up recurring payments for content creators whose work they want to support. The best Twitter accounts or Medium authors get paid directly in the platform, instead of having to figure out some secondary way to monetize their large followings. Even if each upvote was only a few cents, it would still be an improvement over centralized platforms like YouTube, where creators earn only a few thousand dollars per million views. On our decentralized platform, there is no central entity to take a large cut of the money that users pay each other. The platform could even use inflation funding to create a pool of rewards, which are distributed to the top posts each day.The core rules that govern our decentralized service are defined in an open-source protocol. Users interact with that protocol using client-software of their choice. In other words, there would be a variety of apps, all made by different developers, but which all connected to the same social network. These clients may offer different features from one another, but all conform to the same shared protocol, analogous to the way that email clients all use the same standard for sending and receiving emails.Users could use any client they choose, and clients can implement different features or offer third party services. Because we\u2019re building on a decentralized protocol, client developers don\u2019t have to ask permission from any central company, and they can build their product without fear that someday their API access could be revoked. Users don\u2019t have to wait for twitter to add new anti-spam or anti-harassment features, they just use a client that offers them. An ecosystem of services grows on top of the open protocol, letting users do everything they can do with twitter today and more.This illustrates an under-appreciated benefit of decentralized platforms: sustainable ecosystems of third party services. App developers can build useful products on top of a decentralized protocol without fear that someday their API access will be turned off, because there is no one company who can turn it off. The platform can remain neutral, meaning that a larger network of developers will invest their time and money into building businesses on top of it. Chris Dixon\u2019s Why Decentralization Matters explores this argument in depth.Of course, we will still use products and services created by centralized companies. But it will be possible for these companies to restrict the type of control they have over their products, placing more of that control in the hands of users.This already exists in encrypted messaging apps, with products like Signal (made by Open Whisper Systems) that never see or hold any customer communications. By designing their application with end-to-end encryption, they have intentionally limited the control they have over their users.Where early internet startups committed to an ideal of \u201cdon\u2019t be evil\u201d, web 3 companies aim higher to try and ensure that they can\u2019t be evil \u2014 at least with respect to specific kinds of evil. Web 3 includes technologies that let developers limit their control over customers, by refusing to have certain kinds of power in the first place. That doesn\u2019t mean we won\u2019t have to trust centralized companies to some degree, but it does mean we can trust them less.3. User control over identity and dataIn web 3, users will have more control over their identity and their data.Today, most of our online identities belong to someone else, like a Gmail address or Facebook account. Web 3 is laying the groundwork for personal control of online identities.In part, this is a result of the infrastructure being built out for cryptocurrencies. Holding cryptocurrency requires holding private keys, and millions of people use apps that let them do just this. But the same technology can let people manage any kind of blockchain-based data, including a personal identity. The fact that we call these apps \u201cwallets\u201d is no coincidence \u2014 in the future they will hold not just your money, but also your ID.At the same time, web 3 will make it possible for users to retain control of their data. First, because users will have the option of using their own identity, instead of one provided by a third party, limiting the opportunities for identity providers like Facebook to capture user data. Second, because the emergence of decentralized services will mean that in some cases, there won\u2019t be a central company that is in a position to collect, store, and sell your personal data when you are using social media, renting an apartment, or catching a ride home. In general, a greater share of our use of the internet will be through platforms and systems that collect no data about us.Finally, the new capabilities offered by web 3 technologies \u2014 control over our identities and data, and the availability of a worldwide payment network \u2014 will make it easier for individual users to capture the value that have turned social media companies into billion dollar businesses.These companies collect your data because it\u2019s valuable. In web 3, users capture that value instead. If you want to sell data about your personal browsing habits, you will be able to do so directly \u2014 but you get paid, not Facebook. And as we experiment with novel mechanisms for ownership over digital assets, individual users will have new ways to actually own a piece of the technology that they use every day \u2014 an opportunity currently available only to entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, and accredited investors.ConclusionWeb 3 is not inevitable. The descriptions above of a potential future face many barriers, some of which may never be overcome. Some of the \u201copen problems\u201d in web 3 include:Are entrepreneurs actually incentivized to build decentralized applications? Who will fund them? Today, the route to profitability and venture-scale returns for these applications is unclear, whereas the traditional \u201ccentralized\u201d business model is more reliable.Will decentralized applications be worse than centralized ones? A product controlled by a single company might have a more coherent product vision, and is able to rapidly iterate on new features. Centralized products may always have better UX and ease of setup.Will the cryptographic components of decentralized applications be too challenging for most users? How can users manage private keys in a way that can be safely recoverable? Is that even possible without returning to some form of centralized service?Will decentralized applications be more expensive to use? Low level decentralized systems (e.g. file storage, computation, oracles) have many redundancies built in to make them function. Will these layers make decentralized applications too costly?Will decentralized applications built with \u201csmart contracts\u201d ever make sense? Is it possible to write \u201cimmutable\u201d code that fulfills an application\u2019s requirements forever? If we need to upgrade smart contracts, then who gets to decide those upgrades, and is it any different from a centralized application?How will decentralized systems be \u201cgoverned\u201d? Decision making by centralized companies with total control is easier than building consensus among a group of actors with different interests and priorities. How will governance of the base layers work across different political ideologies and cultures?Do enough users actually care about privacy, controlling their own identity, or access to open financial services? Or will the goals of web 3 always be a niche concern?How will governments and regulators respond to web 3? There is inevitable tension created by technologies that give people new capabilities. Web 3 includes technologies that avoid censorship and surveillance, and could be used to sidestep financial regulation and law enforcement.Can the base-layer blockchains used by web 3 apps ever scale to serve millions or billions of users?Even with this uncertainty, web 3 is a worthwhile vision for the future. Cryptocurrency and blockchain enthusiasts are rightly criticized for focusing myopically on technology, rather than the problems that technology is supposed to solve. Cryptocurrencies and blockchains aren\u2019t ends in themselves: they are only valuable in so far as they solve a problem. The web 3 vision is helpful because it reorients us towards that problem: the internet has grown too centralized, and it needs to be opened up.Focusing on the web 3 vision instead of any specific technology also helps us step outside the partisan politics that defines much of the cryptocurrency space. Web 3 is agnostic about whose platform ends up being used \u2014 the focus is on what the technology can actually do and what problems it solves for people.Ethereum or Bitcoin could fail, but if they did the web 3 vision would not die. We would just build new, better versions of those systems using the same applied body of knowledge that we\u2019ve developed over the last 8 years \u2014 cryptoeconomics \u2014 and keep on building.Web 3 won\u2019t be a utopia, and we shouldn\u2019t delude ourselves into thinking it will be. If anything, the last 20 years should teach us that technology is not a magic bullet, and that the same human problems that exist everywhere exist on the internet, too. Politics, power, and control didn\u2019t disappear with the invention of the web, they just took different forms. The promise of web 3 is that at least this time, constraints on power and control are design requirements, not afterthoughts. We have a second chance to build the internet as it was supposed to be, and we might not get a third \u2014 let\u2019s make the most of it.Want to help build this future? L4 is actively hiring.

Dapps should update their code to support this feature, which will be enabled by default in the future.Paul BouchonFollowAug 7, 2018 \u00b7 4 min readThis post was updated on 11/5Since MetaMask\u2019s first release in 2016, we\u2019ve aimed to make using the decentralized web simple. When a user loads a webpage, MetaMask automatically injects an Ethereum provider and a Web3 instance for the webpage to use. This allows dapps to access the blockchain, propose transactions, and read their users\u2019 account addresses.But there\u2019s long been a serious privacy issue with the way this exposure works in the current generation of dapp browsers: malicious websites can use these injected objects to view a user\u2019s active Ethereum address, which in turn provides access to their balance, transaction history, and other potentially-sensitive information. Bad-acting sites can also initiate many unwanted Ethereum transactions on a user\u2019s behalf in the hopes that the user will accidentally approve one.To improve privacy across the decentralized web, MetaMask \u2014 along with other privacy-conscious dapp browsers like Status, Mist, and imToken \u2014 plans to adopt a new, safer strategy that will require updates to existing dapps. This article contains everything developers and their end-users need to know about this necessary breaking change, along with code to help future-proof dapps today.Breaking changeIn order to better protect user privacy, MetaMask and other dapp browsers will stop populating the injected Ethereum provider with user accounts by default. Instead, dapps must request access to user accounts, which will in turn ask the user to approve or deny access to the Ethereum blockchain. If the user approves access, the provider will be populated with accounts and the dapp can initiate account-requiring transactions as they normally would.While MetaMask generally avoids breaking APIs to protect the longevity of existing sites, we believe that a privacy flaw that exposes user accounts and allows unrestricted transaction submissions on a user\u2019s behalf to be sufficient justification.In order to provide the smoothest possible rollout, dapps must be allowed adequate time to make the necessary updates. We plan to release this breaking change on November 2nd, 2018, to commemorate the EIP proposing this change, EIP-1102.What this means for usersOver the next few months, users may begin to see more \u201cLogin\u201d or \u201cConnect\u201d buttons on dapps. These buttons will prompt a popup from MetaMask (or other dapp browser of choice) asking if the user wants to grant the site access to their public account information. The extension will remember which sites have been approved until the user clears their list.This UX pattern of requiring user approval before exposing user accounts is very similar to requesting access to a user\u2019s camera or microphone. Ethereum users can reject account access on websites they feel are untrustworthy, making it impossible for such sites to identify, track, and target them. By only populating the injected Ethereum provider with accounts after user approval, users have control over their own privacy.Draft UI for MetaMask\u2019s user-approved account access implementationPrivacy modeThe MetaMask settings menu will expose a new \u201cprivacy mode\u201d option that can be used to opt in to and out of this privacy-preserving behavior. If \u201cprivacy mode\u201d is enabled, MetaMask will not automatically expose users\u2019 account addresses to the sites they visit. Instead, sites must specifically request access to see users\u2019 accounts. If \u201cprivacy mode\u201d is disabled, legacy behavior will be maintained and MetaMask will automatically expose users\u2019 account addresses to websites. This means that legacy dapps that are not immediately updated to support this change can still be used by disabling privacy mode.On November 2nd, 2018, MetaMask plans to release these changes with \u201cprivacy mode\u201d disabled by default. This option will eventually be enabled by default in a future release.What this means for developersThe Ethereum provider injected by MetaMask and other dapp browsers will now be available at window.ethereum for convenience. Before reading user accounts or initiating RPC method calls that require user accounts, such as eth_sendTransaction, dapps must now request access to user accounts by calling a new method on the provider: ethereum.enable(). This method returns a Promise that\u2019s either resolved with user accounts after user approval, or rejected with an Error after user rejection.The following code shows a new way to start up a dapp that can be used today in both legacy and modern dapp browsers:Preparing your dappAs of MetaMask v4.14.0, the provider is already available at window.ethereum and it exposes the new enable method. Calling this method today won\u2019t trigger an approval popup and accounts will continue to be exposed to dapps until November 2nd; still, dapps can and should be updated as soon as possible to call the new enable method to ensure compatibility with the upcoming change.To fully test a dapp against a version of MetaMask that includes this breaking change:Download a custom build here.Install the build following these instructions.Enable \u201cprivacy mode\u201d in the MetaMask settings menu.Report any issues on Github.ConclusionMaking a breaking change has been a difficult decision for us, but we believe it is better than leaving our users prone to privacy violations. We hope this method of provider requesting will pave the way for a variety of more advanced login strategies, such as requesting a specific network, accounts of particular type, or even user-approved personal information.As dapps switch over to this new pattern, we believe we can begin paving way to a more secure, private, and user-centric web.", "responses": 36, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Privacy", "Crypto", "Blockchain", "Security"]}, {"title": "Understanding Web 3 \u2014 A User Controlled Internet", "post_link": "https://blog.coinbase.com/understanding-web-3-a-user-controlled-internet-a39c21cf83f3?source=search_post---------5", "author_name": "Emre Tekisalp", "author_link": "https://blog.coinbase.com/@etekis", "publish_date": "2018-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2019-04-07", "readtime": "21.0", "claps": 3207, "voters": 313, "content": "Understanding Web 3 \u2014 A User Controlled InternetCoinbase breaks down the motivation and technology behind the development of Web 3Emre TekisalpFollowAug 29, 2018 \u00b7 22 min readThis 3-part post focuses on the why, what and how of the latest chapter in the world wide web\u2019s history, called Web 3. Part 1 explains shortcomings of today\u2019s web and how Web 3 represents an improvement; Part 2 focuses on what the Web 3 stack is; and Part 3 focuses on how developers can build on it.Today\u2019s world wide web, or the internet, has two key missing properties:It doesn\u2019t hold \u201cstate\u201d, independent of trusted operatorsIt doesn\u2019t have a native mechanism to transfer stateLack of state is a result of the simplicity of the protocols that the web is built on, such as HTTP and SMTP. At any moment, if you were to query a node (a device connected to the internet) about its history or current state, it has no idea. From a user\u2019s perspective, this would be like using the internet for the first time from a new browser (no history, favorites, saved settings or auto-complete), every time you use anything connected to the internet. Imagine having to submit your user information every time you\u2019re trying to use a service or downloading all your favorite apps every time you open your device. The internet would not be useable, or at least extremely inefficient.State, however, is crucial to the development of services and applications as it can represent value. As such, two key developments have remedied the state drawback. First, as Brendan Eich highlights, cookies were invented in order for web based applications written in JavaScript to preserve state on each local device. The problem with cookies however is that they are created and controlled by service providers, not the user. The user does not have any control over which provider is giving them state or has access to their state.The second development that addressed the lack of state is centralized service providers that hold user state on their own machines. Today\u2019s large internet companies like Google and Facebook all hold the state, and hence the value created, by billions of people. There\u2019s nothing inherently wrong with this, as their users have benefited from services and value created by the same companies. The problem lies in how the internet benefits these centralized companies way more than it does the public.The second key missing property of the internet, the lack of a native mechanism to transfer state, is partly a by-product of the first issue. If you can\u2019t hold state (and the value it creates), you can\u2019t transfer it. The ability to easily and efficiently transfer value is at the heart of economic development and modern finance. Any improvement in how efficiently you can transfer value has cascading positive effects. Today\u2019s internet has made it easier to transfer information by orders of magnitude and thus has created immense potential for new businesses and services. However, if there\u2019s no easy way for businesses to trade value, they need to find another way to profit from their services.This is why, over the years, the web\u2019s incumbent business model has become advertising, as advertising businesses are the only ones that can efficiently store and transmit the state of billions of users. Again, there is nothing inherently wrong with advertising. But the problem, this time, is three-fold:Third-party intermediaries facilitate and profit from every single advertising transaction;Advertising favors established businesses, which puts new businesses at a disadvantage, limiting the economy\u2019s growth potential;A richer advertising economy is reliant upon more user data (which feeds ad models), creating misaligned incentives with users and bad UX.A Direction for the InternetThe web, in and of itself, is a technological development. It\u2019s just a bunch of pipes, indifferent to what humans do with it. Humans, ultimately, need to decide where to point it. Over the years, it\u2019s become obvious that its current direction will not benefit those who aren\u2019t already benefiting from it. For the web\u2019s next decade or two, a better direction would be to facilitate:The creation of native economic value by any participant; andThe transfer of this native value to any participant.With the invention of blockchains, thanks to Satoshi Nakamoto and other academics before her/him/them, we now have a way for each participant in a network to hold and transfer state in a digitally native format. Many developers and entrepreneurs around the world have started to build (or #BUIDL, as the case may be) on this new state layer. With the advent of open platforms such as Ethereum, this is becoming easier by the day. As people become aware of what these new capabilities allow them to do, they have started to rally around the cry for an internet that is more open and fair, otherwise known as Web 3.As explained in Part 1, today\u2019s internet is a stateless internet \u2014 its participants can\u2019t hold their own state, nor transfer it from one to another, natively. Blockchains, starting with Bitcoin, gave us a way to hold state in a digitally native way. Those of us in the crypto and blockchain ecosystem have started to refer to this new fundamental capability as Web 3. Although we\u2019re still in the very early days, we\u2019re starting to have a rough understanding of what benefits it will bring. L4, for example, has put together some great insights on these benefits.This part is about what the Web 3 stack looks like today, and likely in the future:The Web 3 Stack \u2014 A modular frameworkThe layers in the framework above start from the top and get built down the y-axis. Colors represent compatibility between modules in the different layers. For example, today\u2019s Crypto Goods (yellow), as depicted above, are compatible with EVM (blue to yellow) but not with the Bitcoin Script (green to red). EVM, in turn, is compatible with the Ethereum Blockchain (blue), but not with the Bitcoin Blockchain (green). This allows us to place in to the framework a future Crypto Good that is compatible with the Bitcoin Script and hence is recorded on the Bitcoin Blockchain (although this is highly unlikely due to technical challenges). Such a modularity is crucial to the robustness of Web 3, as upgrading one of the layers should not require a complete rewrite of everything below it. It\u2019s also important to note that although the modules within each layer may end up looking completely different in 5 years, the layers themselves are intended to be comprehensive and cover all the pieces that make up Web 3.State LayerThe state layer preserves the state of all that happens below it. It is almost exclusively provided by blockchain infrastructure and allows for any participant to take part as long as they obey the rules of the preferred network. Any successful network\u2019s goal will be to be a default and reliable infrastructure, akin to today\u2019s DNS providers. No one recognizes them when they work as intended (99% of the time), but we all feel the pain when they don\u2019t.This layer can either be a public or private/permissioned layer. One can argue that by default, state is a singular and universal truth, and that creating private layers is akin to creating parallel universes. There are also technical differentiators between public and permissioned layers, but they are beyond the scope of this piece and hence will be deferred to developers as a design choice for their products.From hereon every layer is built on or is compatible with the layers below it.Computation LayerSoftware allows humans to give instructions to computers. The Web 3 Computation Layer allows humans to instruct the State Layer to do what they want. Not every Computation Layer allows for anything to be done, though. Bitcoin\u2019s Script for example is very limited in that it allows for very little beyond transaction orders. The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) on the other end is a full Turing Complete machine and, as such, allows for any arbitrarily complex computation to be executed by a state layer that supports EVM.The choice of Computation Layer for application developers (as well as blockchain developers) is a key one as it determines which blockchains a given application can run on. For example any application compiled to EVM can today run on the Ethereum blockchain and not on the Bitcoin blockchain. The Ethereum Foundation is working to change Ethereum\u2019s default computation layer to another technology called eWASM, based on WebAssembly, or WASM. Other State Layer projects such as Dfinity are also planning to be WASM compatible. This would mean that an app compiled to eWASM could theoretically work on both Ethereum and Dfinity blockchains, and any other blockchain that decides to be WASM compatible.Component LayerCombining the State Layer with the Computation Layer increases the design space for new types of digital value by 1,000x (aka programmable money). As such, we have already started seeing a ton of experimentation by developers. Some of these implementations have so much potential (examples below), it\u2019s possible to imagine entire sub-economies being built on top of a given component. My colleague here at Coinbase, Jacob Horne, has laid out this phenomenon (along with the Protocol Layer) as Cryptoeconomic Primitives and did a deep dive on one of them, Crypto Goods.Components are built on the Computation Layer, reusing standardized smart contract templates. OpenZeppelin is a well established resource to access such templates. The creator of a component is required to issue new smart contracts onto the State Layer.Examples of these components are:Native Currency: A required and core part of any public blockchain. Gives any participant the right to pay the blockchain and receive the desired service in return, usually in the form of a transaction. Examples: Bitcoin, EtherCrypto Assets: Fungible assets which have a basic set of functionalities and metadata associated. Gave rise to the ICO boom as it allows anyone to create their own money. Beyond money, enables many other asset types to be digitized such as stocks, bonds, ownership rights. Most common standard is ERC-20.Crypto Goods: Non-fungible assets which have a basic set of functionalities and a richer set of metadata associated with it. Also known as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) or crypto collectibles. Was first explored by CryptoPunks and made popular by CryptoKitties. Enables unique goods to be digitized such as collectible items, game assets, access rights, art. Most common standard is ERC-721.Identity: A self-sovereign container for identity information. In and of itself, provides very little valuable information about what it identifies. However, it allows for claims to be associated with the container, which can come from a large array of sources, such as governments or other trusted parties (e.g. Google, Coinbase). Leading proposals are ERC-725/ERC-735 and some of the protocol proposals by uPort. Ethereum Naming Service (ENS) is also highly relevant as a different type of identifier.Stablecoins: Crypto assets with a stable value, pegged against a source, such as the value of the USD. A very complex problem with different types of theoretical and practical solutions. Some examples are TrueUSD, Dai and Reserve.Protocol LayerOnce you have Components created on the State Layer, they need to come alive. Certain functions are so fundamental and common to the lifecycle of these components that they are becoming standardized. This is not only because these functions need to talk the same language (hence the name Protocol Layer) but also because network effects make them more efficient. These protocols essentially enable the formation of healthy markets for relevant components, much like we have in the physical world, only orders of magnitude cheaper and more efficient.Multiple different protocols have started to gain traction. These take the form of canonical smart contracts that are deployed by the team developing the protocol and called by each application that wants to apply the relevant function onto a component:Trading: If a component is to have value, it needs to be tradable. Trading protocols allow wallet-to-wallet trading of assets in a trustless way. It\u2019s important to draw the distinction between these \u201crelayers\u201d and most \u201cdecentralized exchanges\u201d, which take custody of assets on a smart contract. Trades that get facilitated via trading protocols never take custody of the traded assets. Some leading projects include 0x and Kyber Network. To find out more about the daily trading volumes supported on the 0x protocol, you can visit here.Lending: Lending increases the efficiency of any asset as it facilitates a return on the investment, which otherwise may have been zero. With a standard lending protocol, an individual in the US can lend money to another individual in Zimbabwe, smartphone-to-smartphone. Dharma and ETHLend are currently the two leading projects in this space.Derivatives: The market for derivatives is the largest in the world, estimated at $1.2 quadrillion globally. Building derivatives as a protocol allows trustless markets to form for components native to the State Layer. dy/dx and Market Protocol are two projects in this space.Scalability / Transfer LayerBlockchains\u2019 scalability problems are infamous. Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain has a transaction capacity of 7 transactions per second and Ethereum\u2019s is 15 per second. Although there is ample debate about whether blockchains themselves should make concessions to facilitate thousands of transactions per second or not, it\u2019s becoming widely accepted that a different layer (also known as Layer 2 scalability) for the transfer of state is required to support a robust topology. These scalability solutions need to be compatible with the Computation Layer of the underlying blockchain.There are multiple proposals for how this can be done. Below are some examples:Payment Channels: Allows only for transfer of a given native currency. Is done via verifiable signatures that are attached to transactions on the State Layer. Requires funds to be deposited to facilitate disputes. Examples: Lighting Network for Bitcoin, Raiden for Ether, SpankChain\u2019s Vynos implementation for Ether.State Channels: Allows for the transfer of any state. Is done via verifiable signatures that are attached to transactions at the State Layer. Requires funds to be deposited to facilitate disputes. Examples: Counterfactual for EVM, Celer Network for EVM, Arcadeum for EVM, FunFair\u2019s Fate Channel for EVM, Connext for EVM.Side Chains: Allows for transfer of any state. Is done by other blockchains that are compatible with the main chain. Requires the side chain to be able to talk to the Computation Layer on the main chain. Also require funds to be locked to facilitate disputes. The side chain may be a centrally or privately managed infrastructure. Examples: PoA Network for EVM, Loom Network for EVM, Plasma Framewok for EVM. It should be noted that Plasma (which has a number of different implementations) has additional requirements built into it so that it provides users with a guarantee to securely withdraw their assets to the Computation Layer. In this way its value proposition is more similar to state and payment channels.Now that we\u2019re up to the fifth layer, we can see how this modular stack allows developers some independence from lower level design choices, such as which blockchain to build on. Let\u2019s take the example of a hypothetical Stable Coin smart contract in the not so distant future \u2014 compiled to eWASM, runs on Ethereum and is compatible with a Counterfactual state channel (i.e. it can be transferred on the state channel). The same code for said Stable Coin would theoretically be compatible with both the EOS and Dfinity blockchains, as both run WASM. It could even be transferable on a similar state channel running on these blockchains.User Control LayerUp until this layer, it\u2019s almost impossible for an average user to consume any of the functionality created, unless s/he talks directly to the Computation Layer via a command line interface. The main functionality of this layer is to manage a user\u2019s private keys and be able to sign transactions on the State Layer. A transaction at the State Layer changes the state of a user\u2019s account and hence is at the core of how users interact with Web 3 applications.Anatomy of a Transaction on the Ethereum BlockchainThere are two types of wallets:Hosted Wallets: Made popular by Coinbase or other crypto exchanges, manage funds on behalf of the user by controlling a limited set of proprietary balances on the State Layer. These may pool users\u2019 funds into aggregated accounts and, as such, manage individual users\u2019 states themselves, outside of the State Layer. This operation may be feasible and economic if the only consideration is monetary value, however it becomes more complex with the increasing number of states that Web 3 applications bring.There are also examples of newer type of Hosted Wallets which manage a dedicated blockchain wallet for each user and support the use of decentralized applications. These promise further flexibility, however are yet to be proven at scale.User Controlled Wallet: Provide a much more flexible and direct way to consume all the arbitrarily complex operations made possible by Web 3. What makes a wallet a User Controlled Wallet is local custody of a user\u2019s private keys and local signing of each transaction. This means that the wallet software doesn\u2019t replicate the user\u2019s private keys in a way that allows a third party to submit transactions on the user\u2019s behalf.This is the ultimate user touch point for all the underlying layers and thus needs to expose all available functionality to applications accessed through this layer. This is usually done through front-end libraries such as web3.js. Part 3 of this post dives deeper on how all of this comes together.Application LayerMuch like the traditional web, the majority of the activity on Web 3 will be through third-party applications built on all the layers below. As an example, users realize value in CryptoKitties, which are Crypto Goods, because of all the functionality made available through apps that consume CryptoKitties, such as cryptokitties.co or kittyrace.com or cryptogoods.com. Applications built on Web 3 have different properties and requirements than traditional web applications, and thus are mostly referred to as decentralized apps, or DApps. As laid out by Matt Condon, DApps will need to become indistinguishable from existing apps if they are to be used by millions of users.However, the new functionalities enabled by decentralization are precisely why DApps are so powerful and why we may see usage numbers beyond today\u2019s web as the stack matures. We are already seeing cutting edge use cases being created by developers around the world in different categories, and users responding to them by putting their money where they see value.Fundraising: Close to $20B raised, 723,000 unique accounts participated, 8,000+ companies received investments. While the space has seen its share of fraud, as of the date of this article, it is the most popular application category, based on the number of accounts that have taken part. Additionally, its attraction continues, as seen by the many new fundraising platforms that facilitate ICOs that are subject to regulation.Trading Platforms: Whereas traditional crypto trading platforms act as an intermediary between you and the State Layer (by acting as Hosted Wallets), trading platforms built as Web 3 enabled applications allow users to remain in control of their funds and not deposit them in to a third party wallet address. In addition, there are potential UX benefits for the trading experience. Many different projects are working to overcome some of the technical challenges, but we\u2019re already seeing usage pick up in this area.Games & Collectibles: $50\u2013100M raised with 60,000 unique accounts owning some Crypto Good. Although way smaller than fundraising, games that interact with Crypto Goods offer an exciting potential for the huge gaming market.Summary of Part 2In this part, I aimed to put together a holistic picture of the Web 3 stack. As explained, the Web 3 stack is comprised of modular components that allow for state to be preserved across all participants, whilst preventing vendor lock-in to layers underneath. Thanks to this, an application does not need to rewrite its entire stack if it wants to change the state layer (i.e. blockchain). This is powerful as it creates healthy competition, and allows each layer to preserve the value it creates, without having to worry about what happens if the rules of the game get changed later on.In Part 1, we reviewed how today\u2019s internet is a state-less internet \u2014 its participants can\u2019t hold their own state, nor transfer it from one to another, natively. Blockchains, starting with Bitcoin, gave us a way to have a stateful web of computers. Those of us in the crypto and blockchain ecosystem have started to call this new internet as Web 3, which we reviewed in Part 2.Web 3 adds a whole new infrastructure layer for applications to interact with, as well as new client functionalities and requirements. The users also need to learn new UX concepts to be able to use these applications. As such, the architecture of Web 3 applications introduce additional elements to the current Web 2.0 framework, as well as new building blocks and tools for a developer to get familiar with.Architecture of a Web 2.0 application vs that of a Web 3.0 applicationWeb 2.0 vs Web 3.0 ArchitectureA simplistic version of today\u2019s Web 2.0 architecture includes a client software, usually a browser or a self-contained application, and a suite of servers providing content and logic, which are all controlled by the same entity \u2014 let\u2019s call it Game Co. In this model, Game Co. has sole control over who may access its servers\u2019 contents and logic, as well as the track record of which users own what and how long that content is kept live. There are many examples in the pages of technology history of how internet companies have changed the rules on their users or stopped their service, with users having no power to preserve the value they\u2019ve created.Web 3.0 architecture leverages what\u2019s enabled by a universal State Layer. It does this by allowing two things:Allowing applications to place some or all of their content and logic on to a public blockchain. Contrary to standard Web 2.0, this content and logic can become public and accessible by anyone.Allowing users to exert direct control over this content and logic. Unlike Web 2.0, users don\u2019t necessarily need accounts or privileged API keys to interact with what\u2019s on the blockchain.Web 3 applications enable this with the help of two key infrastructure pieces:Wallets: Beyond just being the User Control Layer for the Web 3 stack, modern wallets, such as Coinbase Wallet, interact with the main client front-end to allow a seamless user experience. They do this by allowing applications to send requests to the wallet itself using standard libraries, web3.js being the most popular of these. A sample web3.js call can be a payment request, asking the user to confirm that the wallet can send a specified amount of funds to the application\u2019s address. When the user accepts, two things happen: 1) the wallet lets the application front-end know with a response, so it can present a \u201cPayment Submitted\u201d screen, 2) the wallet makes an RPC call to the blockchain server to submit the approved transaction to the blockchain. This is where the second infrastructure piece comes into play.Sample web 3 code allowing a DApp to call a smart contract function from a user\u2019s walletBlockchain Node: There are two types of agents that constantly monitor and engage with a blockchain \u2014 miners and nodes. Miners directly maintain and run the blockchain, whereas, nodes monitor and submit transactions to the blockchain. One can think of them analogous to ISPs versus cloud services providers (e.g. AWS). Similar to how most applications today use AWS\u2019s services to run their application backends, blockchain node providers, such as Infura, do the same with blockchain nodes. When a wallet wants to submit a transaction to the blockchain, or query state information from the blockchain, it makes a call to the node provider. Applications\u2019 app servers can also interact with the node providers themselves, to keep the app\u2019s logic up to date, by making similar RPC calls.What Do Developers Need To Know?Tools & FrameworksKnowing what tools and frameworks to use and being proficient with them is a considerable portion of any developer\u2019s life. Although the Web 3 space is still in its early days, we\u2019re starting to have usable tools that enable developers to get to an MVP stage and iterate faster and faster. This is most visible on Ethereum where, thanks to the work of many in the community, developers are starting to flock in increasing numbers.Credit for chart: Stefano Bernardi; Source of data: GithubAlthough I won\u2019t go through the tools available in detail, it\u2019s helpful to know which ones are at developers\u2019 disposal. The list below is by no means comprehensive (in fact, there is such a list here), but includes tools new developers should start with.Design ChoicesWhat to decentralize: This is a new and key choice. Most early developers have targeted to decentralize the maximum amount possible and put everything on the blockchain. Given the slow and expensive nature of present day blockchains however, this is not possible to do at scale. CryptoKitties was perhaps the first DApps that tried to keep certain portions centralized. For example, their breeding logic is not public. Although they have received some criticism for this, it hasn\u2019t stopped users from spending a significant amount of money to purchase cats bred by this logic. Gods Unchained is another example where the game itself will be hosted on a standard cloud infrastructure, but ownership of assets will be tracked on the State Layer.Although many DApps will take different approaches on decentralization, a first principles way of approaching this choice would be to adopt a \u201cminimally viable public state\u201d approach. If you are building a game where users can own assets, then ownership should be on the blockchain. If you are building a prediction market, then the reporting and pay out of your market should be on the blockchain. At the end of the day, users will find your application valuable if they can claim true ownership over the key activities your application enables.Web app vs native app: This is a choice that\u2019s decades old, yet takes on new form with Web 3 applications. Most DApps today are web apps because of two simple reasons: a) it doesn\u2019t require the user to download a new app every time, b) users can use your app without having to create a new wallet every time. The small number of native DApps that exist all lead the user to create a new wallet, which is not the ideal user experience. It\u2019s easy to see how this is not a feasible future, as users will not maintain keys for hundreds of wallets. There will, in the near future, be more seamless ways of enabling native apps to go past this UX challenge, but for now, web apps allow a much easier onboarding experience.Desktop vs mobile: The Web 3 version of this choice isn\u2019t about choosing between one or the other, but about how users end up using your DApp on both. On desktop, a Chrome extension like MetaMask has been how most users have interacted with DApps. Although it requires the user to download a new extension, the user is still interacting with a browser interface they are familiar with.On mobile however, extensions are not possible, at least on iOS. That\u2019s why wallet apps, such as Coinbase Wallet, place browsers inside their apps. Once in the browser view, the DApp experience is the same as on desktop. There also are several technical nuances to be aware of when developing for mobile, which Coinbase Wallet\u2019s Head of Engineering Pete Kim covers here.Other challenges with no solutions to date:Who pays for gas: Every DApp built on Ethereum today makes its users pay the cost of transactions, called gas for the Ethereum blockchain. This won\u2019t be feasible over the long term if millions of non-crypto-native people are to use Web 3 applications. There are a number of theoretical solutions, some which are closer to being practical, such as gas relayers, however none are functional yet.App-specific accounts or not: One of the exciting applications of Web 3 is universal identity. Since there aren\u2019t many functional identity solutions today, some DApps are still asking users to create an account, enabling some identity to be associated with their activity on the app. This is not too different than the Web 2.0 way of doing things. Once we have functional decentralized identity solutions, how should DApps treat and present this? Although there\u2019s no clear answer, some are already presenting proposals, such Origin\u2019s demo built using ERC-725 and 735.SummaryIn Part 3, I aimed to summarize the modifications Web 3 brings to the architecture of applications and what developers should know when starting to build Web 3 apps. A great resource for beginners is Cryptozombies, which is a fun workshop teaching anyone how to create their first Web 3 app.Although the way to build Web 3 apps will change in many ways as the infrastructure around it evolves, what\u2019s key is that apps are being built today. It\u2019s the wild west of the web as we know it and a lot of really smart teams are starting to tackle the challenges and opportunities made available.This concludes our three part post on Understanding Web 3 \u2014 A User Controlled Internet. Here at Coinbase, we are building products to support an Open Financial System, and we see Web 3 as the way developers all around the world will build the products and businesses that make this vision a reality. If you want to join us and the rest of the ecosystem by building your own Web 3 application, make sure to check out Coinbase Wallet to get access to the many users who are already using DApps! We\u2019re also hiring for many different roles and investing in the companies that will build the decentralized web with us.Thanks to Linda Xie, Josh Stark, Tony Sheng, Sid Coelho-Prabhu, Jacob Horne and Daniel Harrison for feedback.Unless otherwise indicated, all images provided herein are by Coinbase.Disclaimer: This website may contain links to third-party websites or other content for information purposes only (collectively, \u201cThird-Party Sites\u201d).

It is probably fitting that most of the users who would use these Dapps still \u201clive\u201d in the web2 and haven\u2019t even heard of the promises of the decentralized Web3.Even if they were to come and see these shiny new apps, they would have a hard time, from understanding the lingo, the purpose, the dynamics of these Dapps, to even visually tell them apart from normal web apps.It must be said that there are lot of good tools (Drizzle, MetaMask) that are coming out and are attacking some of these issues. We will get there.These Design Principles want to propose some ideas on how to fix this, with guidelines to help designers and developers, so that we can all make that shiny future more approachable and near, for everybody.Web3 Design vs Blockchain DesignOther people have written on \u201cBlockchain Design\u201d[1], while presenting solutions relating to the front-end user experience of Decentralized Apps (Dapps).Although Sarah Mills\u2019, lead designer at Consensys, article is an inspiring read and she is clearly the leading voice calling for designers in the Blockchain space, I think that the wording \u201cBlockchain Design\u201d is more appropriate to define the properties, and their interactions, of the Blockchain construct itself: things like the consensus algorithm, the supply base, the block rewards, turing completeness, computation/\u201dgas\u201d cost, on or off chain governance mechanisms and many more. In this article I will be referring instead to \u201cWeb3 Design\u201d, indicating mainly principles that should be applied to the creation of the user facing parts of Decentralized Apps.It is tempting to use the word \u201cBlockchain\u201d in the title, but that would be clickbait \ud83d\ude09Why Web 3 Design PrinciplesToday a user can interact with a Smart Contract deployed on the Blockchain in several ways: either directly via command line, through the form-like interfaces of their digital wallet or Dapp browser, or maybe through the richer front-end that the Smart Contract developer has or will develop.It is obvious that the path to mass adoption of Dapps goes through the latter: providing a rich user interface unified with the experience of dealing with a Blockchain based Distributed Application.Today as developers we are, righteously, very busy building the infrastructure of the Blockchain and the Smart Contracts of our projects, so it is obvious that not many Dapps currently have a usable front end or, if they have one, safe for the content, they are mainly indistinguishable from any other web app around.However Dapps are fundamentally different from normal web or mobile apps because they are based on, and should strongly convey, the powerful principles enabled by the Blockchain: decentralization, transparency, trustlessness, immutability, uncensorability etc.These properties of the Blockchain, and by reflection of the front-end Dapps, are what these Design Principles codify into usable tools.The objective is that, once applied correctly, a user that lands on a Dapp can immediately tell she is interacting with one and, more importantly, has access to the powerful properties of the Blockchain and therefore knows she can trust every interaction with the application.Variables to consider to understand the principlesthe main target in mind is a non-technical user, although some principles are geared towards more savvy users toonot all Dapps need all principlesthe solutions shown in the examples are just some initial ideas to start the conversationsome principles could be implemented in different ways by each Dapp developersome web3 principles suggest the need for an external tool, service or library rather than imagining that each developer would implement their solution (more on this in the next steps)most if not all web3 Design Principles would benefit from being codified in a Bootstrap like developer friendly library (more on this in the next steps)If you are interested in this, jump to the \u201cnext steps\u201d section at the end to see how we can work together.Approach to DesignDesign is also about anticipating problems and offering solutions. In this case I tried to \u201cproject\u201d (a better word in my opinion for it\u2019s etymological meaning of \u201claunching forward\u201d into the future) the questions that a user might have when interacting with a Dapp.Questions like:is it safe to do this (action_dapp_asks_me_to_do)?will money be at risk if I screw up?I\u2019ve heard crypto is supposed to be more private\u2026what happens to the data I send? where will it be stored? Can I be identified?who will see the data I input? where is the code being run?what will happen after I do this (action)?how am I supposed to do (crypto_action_here)?what does this (weird_crypto_word) mean?Supposedly the Blockchain can be trusted, but how can I tell which data can be trusted on this app?which data comes from the Blockchain?how can I verify that the data is really stored in the Blockchain?etc.The Design Principles provide tools for developers to answer to these and more questions that users might have.Web 3 Design Principles (index / cheatsheet)This post is quite long so you

if you don\u2019t know where & how to look - If it isn\u2019t transparent it can\u2019t be trusted!Everybody in this space, and their mother, talks about how the Blockchain is \u201ctrustless\u201d and \u201ctransparent\u201d.To explain why these two assumptions are only partially true would take a longer post and make this one err out of track.It is (almost) certainly true at a programmatic level, software verifying data, but those two assumptions fall apart when you confront them with the actual end user experience.Besides the fact that many crypto projects or Dapp front-ends seldom show to the user the Smart-Contract addresses she is interacting with or where the data comes from, it currently is daunting or impossible for a non technical user to understand the information and workings of independent Blockchain explorers like Etherscan. The only thing that is partially controllable today by the user is when intermediating wallets record the transaction hash which can be checked in the aforementioned Blockchain explorers.Therefore, if a user, especially a non technical one, can\u2019t recognize by looking at the UI if a Dapp is actually a Dapp or a normal web app, nor can she verify if the contents she is seeing, or her interactions with it are actually related to a Blockchain, then she isn\u2019t granted the trustlessness and transparency that the Blockchain is supposed to deliver.The Web3 Design principles in this category (TTT) propose a radical transparency approach that would enable any Dapp front-end user, even non technical ones, to be fully aware of data provenance, understand implications of transactions before, during and after their execution, and ultimately, be able to trust the code and service at hand.\ud83d\udccc back to cheatsheet1 \u2014 (Reading Data) Transparency of Data ProvenanceA user needs to be able to tell, possibly just by looking at the page, that a certain data point, or content is actually stored in the Blockchain. It is not user friendly to let them be guessing and it isn\u2019t enough to let them assume that \u201call\u201d data seen is stored in the Blockchain. This requirement might sound tricky for data-intensive Dapps likes Distributed Exchanges but there are some solutions that will be presented in the examples.\ud83d\udd11\ud83d\udd11 Principles \ud83d\udd11\ud83d\udd11The Dapp front-end should:\u27a4 \ud83c\udf00 clarify which data comes from the Blockchain and which doesn\u2019t\u27a4 \ud83c\udf00 clarify the address of the contract(s)\u27a4 \ud83c\udf00 link all Blockchain data to independent Blockchain explorers\u27a4 \ud83c\udf00 clarify which data comes from oracles (\u221elink > 5.Transparency of code)How > Examplesuse css to change the color/font/shape to clearly distinguish Blockchain data Obviously try to be consistent across your project and use always the same \u201cBlockchain color\u201dData Provenance OFFData Provenance ON: colours the data coming from a specific contractuse expandable references:When hovering or clicking on a Blockchain data point, you can provide a contextual expanded tooltip with more information about the datapoint that should make clear where on the Blockchain, in which contracts can the data be found.example of a contextual expandable referencemanage styling conflicts with link-iconsif a data point is both a \u201cBlockchain datapoint\u201d and a link to somewhere in your dapp there are two ways to solve the double action:1- add a link-icon, an icon that follows any \u201cBlockchain data-point\u201d that gives the expandable reference functionality while leaving intact the normal working of the link.2- open the expandable reference and insert a secondary link inside of it (but consider that this creates more friction because you are asking the user to do 2 actions instead of one).Example of a link-icon that opens the contextual reference. This is for adding the chainView functionality to a link that goes somewhere in your Dappuse a \u201cChain-view\u201d mode and/or side panelFor data intensive interfaces like Decentralized Exchanges or market views following the previous suggestions would probably mean styling the majority of the interface, probably adding more confusion. To solve this you can envisage a \u201cChain-view\u201d button that when hovered or clicked, temporarily styles the data. It\u2019s like putting a filter over the page, a filter that helps the user see which data is a Blockchain datapoint. Expanding this idea, the \u201cChain-view\u201d could also be a side panel where many of the functionalities described in the Web3 Design Principles could be hosted. In this case the Chain-View panel could have the aforementioned option to turn on or off the visibility of the Blockchain data points. In the next examples we will see many more uses of the Chain-View panel.Chain View side panel with the Data Provenance Option openedClearly show which links open the external Blockchain explorerIf a link is going to send the user to another page it is better to control the flow of the user on the page by:1 \u2014 adding a clarifying button that states what is going to happen: ie \u201copen in Etherscan\u201d2 \u2014 ad a link-icon for independent block explorers and use it consistently across your UI\ud83d\udccc back to cheatsheet2 \u2014 (Writing Data) Transparency of TransactionsThe user needs to be aware that data will be written to the Blockchain, and especially when it entails the exchange of an economic value (cryptocurrencies or tokens). Even though Wallets do warn the user about this intent, the Dapp should clarify this before launching the transaction request to the wallet.Types of TransactionsThere are different types of transactions that can happen when interacting with the Blockchain and each have different consequences. The user should be able to differentiate between them through the information provided by the UI in different phases, even before launching the transaction.2.1 - Value Transfers \u2014 2.1.1 - ETH \u2014 2.1.2 - Tokens 2.2 - Function calls \u2014 2.2.1 - contract methods with value implications \u2014 2.2.2 - contract methods without value transfers 2.3 - Factories: contract generating functionsTransaction data and costsTransactions usually have a \u201cpayload\u201d, some data attached, for example passed to the contract methods, and that is usually used to write or calculate what to write in the Blockchain.Moreover writing data to the Blockchain usually has a cost, a \u201cgas fee\u201d to pay for the transaction.The user should understand these two informations and be made aware of their content.\ud83d\udd11\ud83d\udd11 Principles \ud83d\udd11\ud83d\udd11The Dapp front-end should:\u27a4 \ud83c\udf00 (Permanence) clarify actions that are irreversible (all writing Txs)\u27a4 \ud83c\udf00 (Value) clarify actions that involve money or value\u27a4 \ud83c\udf00 (Privacy) clarify actions that could potentially lead to user identificationThis is one of the hardest principles to implement as potentially any writing data can help to identify the user (until ZTKSnarks), and as smart-contract and web3 developers we can be unaware of the current and future sophistication of forensic tools, which are also usually closed source solutions. Just take into account this principle if privacy is a main feature of your Dapp, and use it to guide the design choices of when to clarify what actions are potential risks for your privacy seeking users.\u27a4 \ud83c\udf00 (Factory) clarify actions that generate new contracts in the users name This principle is to be applied only to Dapps that help the user create contracts with their address as the creator of the message. Apply this especially if it\u2019s on MainNet.Guidelines for all transactions:\u27a4 \ud83c\udf00 clarify and confirm in advance the new future State \u27a4 \ud83c\udf00 show the data that is being used for a transaction in a human readable format and in the way the Smart Contract requires it (\u221elink 5.Transparency of Code)\u27a4 \ud83c\udf00 clarify suggested values for gas price and how to overwrite the Tx (\u221elink 9.Gas Price and Transaction Reversals) \u27a4 \ud83c\udf00 manage Transaction wait time (\u221elink > 6.Time/Wait Management)\u27a4 \ud83c\udf00 After the transaction is recorded show a relevant summary of the transaction to the user and how she can access the history (\u221elink 4.User Interaction History) \u27a4 \ud83c\udf00 possibly, clarify what actions are NOT transactions and hence safeHow > examplesuse css to indicate all irreversible actionsmaybe use a warning/highlight colour like redadd a tiny written warnings along with the buttonie: attention irreversible action ahead > learn moreuse double confirmation:open a pop-up or toast, after the user presses the button and before calling the wallet/MetaMask, where you can inform the user of all the implications and ask for a confirmation.Also offer the user to: \u2014 cancel the action \u2014 never show these pop-ups again (because she is an expert user) and when doing so tell the user that she could eventually reactivate the feature in the Chain-View side panel.clarify & anticipate future expected stepseither with tiny written descriptions, label subtitles or with wizard like flows which have more steps to accomplish an action.In the case of wizards: \u2014 clearly show the user the number and title of the next steps \u2014 allow the user to inspect the future screens to understand what is going on and what is going to happen (\u221elink 8.Newbie mode), although you should also grey out the functionality to not confuse the fact that she can have a sneak peak preview with the actual action.Add options to the Chain-View side panelThe side panel could be the place for many of these warnings as well as offering an inspector into the transactions, defining \u2014 the type of transaction \u2014 the data associated with the transaction \u2014 the gas costs \u2014 all other relevant information (\u221elink 5.Transparency of Code)\ud83d\udccc back to cheatsheet3 \u2014 (Pushed Data) Transparency of Smart Contract EventsEvents are the notifications of the Web3 era(Ethereum) Smart-Contracts can emit Events which are used to both store logs in the Blockchain and to reactively inform Dapps front-ends via Javascript that something has happened.It is important to understand that Events  \u2014 can have parameters, information added to the logs \u2014 are permanently stored in the Blockchain and therefore can be searched for Events are normally used by developers for various things such as signaling when a certain condition has been fulfilled or when a certain action has happened: a new user has become a token holder, a deposit has been made, or a data has been received from an Oracle, and many more.The fact that Events can be searched is immensely useful to log the behavior of one specific Dapp, and understand what happened and when, across the thousands or millions of blocks since the Dapp creation.To better understand why this is so important let me quickly tell you a personal story:When the Dao was hacked in 2016, I had the chance to collaborate with the group solving one part of the big problem: understanding who was owed what amount of Ether from the ExtraBalance account. When users bought Dao Tokens during the ICO, according to the fee schedule, different amounts of ether would go into the ExtraBalance.Two of the group\u2019s problem solvers, Nick Johnson and Bokky Poobah, used the \u201cCreatedToken\u201d Event, to trace all transactions related to the DAO ICO, while I went the \u201chard route\u201d imagining a situation where Events had not been implemented, and developed a deterministic parser for the Blockchain, a forensic tool very useful in case of malicious or badly planned smart-contracts. I did this also because there wasn\u2019t an Event like \u201cReceivedByExtraBalance\u201d to pinpoint that part of the transaction.Here is where it gets interesting: while their scripts would take a few hours, mine would take around one day or more; that is because I had to go through (re-execute) every single transaction in the Blockchain, while they had already access to the (almost) \u201cright\u201d transactions thanks to the Events logs. Even so, it took the three of us approximately two months to reconcile the numbers and return the whole balance to the original owners.What does this have to do with Web3 Design Principles?Events are used by the developers arbitrarily: they can choose to put or not an Event to signal something important about their Dapp. To give access to the front-end user to the Events in the Smart Contract is being transparent about these choices.A high degree of useful Events can be a sign of a transparent Smart Contract and Dapp, one that is not afraid to let you know what it does internally. While little to no Events can be a sign of a sloppy or even malicious Smart Contract.As in the above DAO story, the lack of Events would force a user to develop their own deterministic Blockchain parsers to understand what happens inside, a practically impossible task also because she would need an Archival node.Moreover, Events are useful for developers to create several types of analytics, notifications and reactive data sources, even independently from the Smart Contract owner/creator. Possibly, this power should be made accessible to the front-end user too without needing to code. Web3 Postulates:\u2014 it isn\u2019t transparency if it requires a humongous effort to find, see and verify the data \u2014 It isn\u2019t transparency if 99% of users are deterred from wanting to look [2]\ud83d\udd11\ud83d\udd11 Principles \ud83d\udd11\ud83d\udd11a Dapp front-end should:\u27a4 \ud83c\udf00 clarify and make accessible to the end user all Events, even if they are just for developer purposes\u27a4 \ud83c\udf00 apply relevance: show interrupting messages only for information relevant to the current user, but still allow the user to inspect all Events in a separate Interface\u27a4 \ud83c\udf00 allow the user to subscribe-to, unsubscribe-from or temporarily mute certain EventsEvents are contract specific so these are simple suggestions of possible implementations.In addition these ideas are better solved by an external tool, service, a plugin, or library, that doesn\u2019t require the Dapp front-end developers to implement all these \u201cnon-core\u201d features into their Dapp.How > exampleshave a notification center accessible to the user, this is probably a section in the \u201cChain-View\u201d side paneluse toasts for important messagescreate filters to select/deselect only certain events or customise notifications based only on certain parameters.  Some filters can be: \u2014 if it contains Ether / tokens \u2014 based on address (mine/the user\u2019s or another address or addresses) \u2014 between timeX and timeY, blockX and blockYetc.\ud83d\udccc back to cheatsheet4 \u2014 (History) Accessible and transparent User interaction HistoryIn a future where we interact with hundreds or thousands of Dapps, tokens and probably chains, it makes sense for the user to have a clear history logged of her interactions with each one for future reference. Wallets already store the history of all transactions, which is a start, but it\u2019s only for one account at a time, and it might therefore be hard to figure out if you interacted across several of them.Moreover wallets would still be hard unless additional features are built, to filter out only those belonging to a specific Dapp for example.It is certainly user friendly for a Dapp to help you remember every interaction you did with it, just like you can go back to \u201cpurchase history\u201d in any normal app.It is even more important for Distributed Exchanges and Dapps that could generate hundreds or thousands of transactions for each user.\ud83d\udd11\ud83d\udd11 Principles \ud83d\udd11\ud83d\udd11A Dapp front-end should:\u27a4 \ud83c\udf00 provide a history of all transactions from a given addressAllow the user to inspect all interactions ever made with the Smart Contract, probably mainly those of type 2, that write to the Blockchain and therefore modify the state\u27a4 \ud83c\udf00 clarify where is the history storedTo provide a history relative to a given user probably means recording her Transaction Hashes on a DB, either on a remote server or better in the user\u2019s local indexDB. This is of course a potential privacy risk, so take note of the privacy principles (\u221elink 2.Transparency of Transactions) and code transparency principles (\u221elink 5.Transparency of Code) to clarify to the user where this data is stored.\u27a4 \ud83c\udf00 give tools to navigate, search, export, and delete the history cacheHow > examplessimilar to the Event notification center, have a User-History tab or dedicated page, probably inside the Chain-View side panelallow to filter for different type of transactions (value-eth, value-tokens, function calls, contract generating if pertinent)allow to filter by date, from the beginning or between datesoptional user friendly addition: allow users to add a non-chain note field to the transaction, such as a simple reminder if they want to simply have a human readable and searchable plaintextoptional: have a search field in case there are hundreds of interactions and if it\u2019s relevant to your Dapp ie: Decentralised Exchanges might want to add such a feature to allow the user to search for transactions relating only to specific tokensexport: allow user to optionally export the data in csv and explore it through other means, again, especially appropriate in case of large datasetsdelete: allow the user to delete the History from the local cache, but of course clarify that the real history of transactions is not deleted neither from their wallet nor from the Blockchainimport: it makes sense to add an import option only if the Dapp allows the user to add custom notes to each transaction, otherwise the information can be simply reconstructed from the Blockchain\ud83d\udccc back to cheatsheet5 \u2014 (Code & Environment) Transparency of CodeIf a Dapp can be trusted also means if the code being executed can be trusted.To be trusted, Dapps should be as transparent as possible about all the aspects of their code.Web3 Postulates\u2014 for a Dapp to be trusted, it\u2019s code needs to be trusted \u2014 for code to be somewhat trusted, it needs to be transparent, independently executable and verifiable\ud83d\udd11\ud83d\udd11 Principles \ud83d\udd11\ud83d\udd11a Dapp front-end should:\u27a4 \ud83c\udf00 Clarify which Blockchain is being usedit seems obvious but in a scenario with proliferating Dapps many can be Blockchain agnostic or run different versions on different chains. Also with Plasma, Polkadot, Cosmos and other scaling solutions it is possible that a Dapp might be tracking transactions in it\u2019s own sub-chain nested deep down a tree of other Plasma chains or other parachains or Cosmos Zones or Hubs. The user should be made aware of where their data is being written and therefore be aware of the technical variables (security, speed, etc) and where to independently verify the data.\u27a4 \ud83c\udf00 Clarify the address of the Smart Contract(s) that are being used for read and write operations and link to independent Blockchain explorers (\u221elink 1.Transparency of Data Provenance).\u27a4 \ud83c\udf00 Clarify which code is open source and where to find it.\u27a4 \ud83c\udf00 Clarify where code is being run (local vs Remote Server)This might be one of the most difficult and cumbersome to implement at a visual level, but if parts need to run on a server have at least a page explaining which parts and why and point to it from any relevant part of the UI.If the \u201cchain-view\u201d mode seen in the examples of the first principles (\u221elink 1.Transparency of Data Provenance) has been implemented, that would be a good place where to add these other views. \u27a4 \ud83c\udf00 Clarify the web3 provider / Blockchain node (local node, Dapp controlled node, Infura, MetaMask?, or other node)Why? Because instrumented nodes can record data, like etherscan, and could potentially be a source of privacy risks for the user. - If possible or relevant allow users to switch to their own node Although this is already taken care by providers like MetaMask, this principle applies in case your web3 Dapp, for some reason, does broadcasts transactions to specific nodes. Also, transactions going through your own private node can be faster to execute because they avoid the potential queues of public nodes especially during high demand events like crowdsales.\u27a4 \ud83c\udf00 Clarify if the Dapp is running on MainNet or on TestNet Although the web3 provider takes care of this, especially make sure that the user understands that actions are being run on the MainNet if it\u2019s the case (resort also to the other principles in \u221elink 2.Transparency of Transactions)\u27a4 \ud83c\udf00 Clarify which data read from the chain come from Oracles or has been influenced by oraclesUser friendly additions \u27a4 \ud83c\udf00 Allow for DIY code executionallow more advanced users to see the transaction function call before it is sent so that they could verify it and reproduce the action by themselves via command line. This might seem as an exaggeration because the Dapp front-end is there to simplify the user and hide certain technical matters, but a skeptical/paranoid user would want to verify even single transactions: if the Blockchain is like a distributed database then a user should be able to perform the writing operations independently and the Dapp should still work. In a radical transparency attitude towards the code, a Dapp that allows this feature is signaling \u201cDon\u2019t Trust. Verify\u201d https://blog.wizsec.jp/2018/02/kleiman-v-craig-wright-bitcoins.html?m=1An enhanced version of the Data Provenance where the users can also copy paste the code to retrieve the data by themselves\u27a4 \ud83c\udf00 Clarify the inputs required by the Smart Contract:Smart Contracts require often big numbers with a lot of zeros, which are unfriendly to the user, especially because it\u2019s very easy to make costly mistakes. It is normal and advisable that the Dapp UI simplifies this process to the user, allowing smaller numbers in a more understandable and less error prone range, like 0 to 100. However, in light of the previous transparency of code principles, it should be made clear to the user where those inputs are being simplified by the UI and clarify, especially in the DIY code inspector, the actual input that the Smart Contract is expecting. A real case where this was confusing was raised in a discussion with Jorge Izquierdo about the Aragon Voting app . Developers can use the same solution presented for that case and clarify to the user some examples with: the simple number, the scientific notation and the actual input (with all zeros) that the Smart Contract is expecting.detail of the example from the Aragon wikiHow > exampleshave a \u201cCode Transparency\u201d page always accessible like the Terms of Service or Privacy Policy pageslink to your github repos in several placesadd to the \u201cchain-view\u201d panel (shown in the examples of chapter 1.Transparency of Data Provenance) a section dedicated to code transparency with \u25cb information on: \u2014 the Blockchain in use, \u2014 the properties of such Blockchain, especially the average block confirmation time (\u221elink 6.Time/Wait Management)  \u2014 wither it\u2019s MainNet or TestNet \u2014 the web3 provider in use (allow for switching),  \u2014 the contract addresses, \u2014 possibly a simplified version of the contract\u2019s ABI with just the methods actually called by the code \u2014 if there is any part of the code being run not-locally (textual explanation and motivation) \u2014 the link to the github repos\u25cb switches, filters or options to: \u2014 display, with icons and/or by changing colors, which parts / components have data that is processed on a server \u2014 display, with (the \u201ccloud-to-chain\u201d oracle) link-icons and/or by changing colors, which data comes from oracles \u2014 if relevant, change the web3 provider  \u2014 a preview of transactions being called with the function calls that could be copied and executed on the command line with notes on the inputs if relevant.an example of the Code Transparency panel and information\ud83d\udccc back to cheatsheetGeneral Web3 UX PrinciplesThe following principles don\u2019t directly relate to the Transparency and Trustless properties any more and are rather aiming at solving a set of other UX problems that arise from the general use and implementation of Distributed Applications based on the Blockchain.6 \u2014 Time/Wait ManagementUntil the scalability problems are solved, Transactions are asynchronous and according to the underlying Blockchain and the current network congestion, could take a long time to process and be fully confirmed.A well designed Dapp needs to clarify these informations and manage the user\u2019s wait until her action is confirmed.\ud83d\udd11\ud83d\udd11 Principles \ud83d\udd11\ud83d\udd11a Dapp front-end should:\u27a4 \ud83c\udf00 (Manage the user\u2019s expectation) Clarify at every transaction the average block confirmation time of the underlying Blockchain and the current network congestion\u27a4 \ud83c\udf00 (Manage the waiting time) Show liveness indicators during waiting timeHow > ExamplesAs a sequence of UX events a Dapp shouldexplain how gas choices will affect their waiting time (\u221elink.9 Gas Prices and TXs Reversal)show warning about chain specific timesShow a progress or waiting icon until it\u2019s not resolvedIf things are taking longer than normal, show a feedback and potential causes and/or solutions ie: \u201c it\u2019s taking longer than expected.

This is more than other spaces one that requires a bit of education, both for security reasons (handling private keys), but also to fully understand why the properties of the Blockchain are such a revolutionary phenomenon and how Dapps differ from other apps.Also important is the fact that this space is so wonderfully faceted that often requires new mental models and a multidisciplinary understanding: the Internet of Value is creating thousands of tokenized ecosystems influenced by market dynamics, which are normally studied in Economics, Finance and Game Theory; It is very unlikely that the masses will be versed or have ever had exposure to these disciplines. Therefore Distributed Applications should make an effort to educate new and established user to all aspects of their working.Most of the previous principles have a newbie user in mind but there are a couple more things that developers should consider.\ud83d\udd11\ud83d\udd11 Principles \ud83d\udd11\ud83d\udd11A Dapp front-end should:\u27a4 \ud83c\udf00 Weave in educational information with the normal interactionThe main task for Dapp Designer has been excellently summarized by Nick Neuman: \u201cA good end-user application will bake education into the product experience. This means explaining in a concise and interesting way why a user is doing something while she is doing it, and building the product so it\u2019s very hard for the user to do something unsafe.\u201d\u27a4 \ud83c\udf00 Provide 2 or more levels of educational content: Blockchain basics and Dapp specific lingoThis is not a principle just for our time in which newbies are coming on board, it would be a good practice for all apps, especially those that have an internal or contextual lingo or unique mechanism, to add another educational layer: ie. if you are building a token fund manager, don\u2019t assume your users know finance and what each term means; instead educate them both to the basics of Blockchain and the basics of finance, at the very least to understand the words you are using.\u27a4 \ud83c\udf00 Minimize and increase progressively the amount of new things and concepts that the user needs to learnBlockchain projects, in spite of the tokenized incentives to adoption, will still have to face the normal friction and churn that any Software service experiences: users will choose simpler alternatives especially if a Dapp asks too much of them. Therefore Dapps, in delivering their educational content to newcomers, should try to minimize the use of new words and concepts, especially in the pages for the generic public (ie the home page) and progressively show more learnings in pages for engaged users (ie User dashboards). This can be achieved also by using simpler language, avoiding lingo, and using analogies to explain complex new information with knowledge the user might already be familiar with. As an example see how Spankchain created the concept of a card to avoid having to explain payment channels.\u27a4 \ud83c\udf00 If possible or relevant, accelerate learning providing the \u201cexpert\u2019s interpretation\u201dDemystify the meanings of your Dapps functions, how they interact and how an expert would think about the effects.What would an expert know about a certain specific thing? How would they interpret the data? How would they act upon it? What choices would they make?The answers to those questions could be weaved in as suggestions in the Dapp UI, if they are relevant.Examples go from anticipating good gas pricing (\u221elink 9.Gas Prices) to indicating wither it\u2019s a good or bad moment to exchange a certain token (just an example).\u27a4 \ud83c\udf00 Don\u2019t loose contexttry to weave in the snippets within the interface, with temporary pop-ups that can be easily dismissed that then could open more detailed information in another tab.

This page should be redirected from the glossary pop-up, not linked directly.in any wizard, it would be savvy to enable fast forwarding to the next steps so you can see what is coming, although all their layouts should be greyed out and disabled until you complete the previous steps. This is a good principle for any ui, not only of Dapps.\ud83d\udccc back to cheatsheet9 \u2014 Gas Prices and Transaction reversalsGas is one of the most confusing things for newbies. Even if the name is telling, it is difficult to imagine the cost of computation for services you\u2019ve always had for basically free.What\u2019s more, when users encounter gas for the first time, they don\u2019t know how to price it nor, therefore what a good choice for gas price would be.Even if nowadays in practically all cases the gas is handled by wallets who emit the transaction, this principle is still valid, both for wallet designers and for all those who will ever require or ask the users to choose a gas price.luckily for developers there are tools like the Ethereum Gas Station which offers a convenient API.\ud83d\udd11\ud83d\udd11 Principles \ud83d\udd11\ud83d\udd11Dapps front-end should:\u27a4 \ud83c\udf00 Clarify what is Gas and Gas price (just like with any other lingo \u221elink 8.Newbie mode)\u27a4 \ud83c\udf00 Suggest a good range for gas price and clarify time approximations for the upper and lower range limits these are functions of the current congestion of the network, so the optimal solution would be to query the current Ethereum Gas Station API https://ethgasstation.info/json/ethgasAPI.json to suggest these range bounds.It\u2019s important to clarify to the user that this is a time based suggestion and that the proposed values could change in the future. \u27a4 \ud83c\udf00 possibly show gas values converted also to FIAT\u27a4 \ud83c\udf00 Allow for Transaction reversal: in case the user has sent a TXs with low gas price it should be made clear to the user(\u221elink to 6.Time/Wait Management)- that the tx can\u2019t be cancelled once it has been launched- that the only solution is to broadcast another tx with the same nonce and a higher gas price> therefore offer the option to automatically recover the tx nonce and to send it with a higher gasprice.\ud83d\udccc back to cheatsheetDDP Decentralization Design PrinciplesDecentralization is a new powerful form of globalization.One that, for the first time, is potentially led by masses of self-sovereign individuals coalescing around borderless ideas, self-managing organizations and distributed market systems.These Design Principles only want to get the conversation started in both thinking how to make the user feel part of a community and of something more aspirationally bigger than themselves. They are just a hint for developers to start thinking holistically about the function of their Dapps, and the new UX requirements that emerge, in the larger context of the distributed societies we are creating.10 - Sense of CommunityDapps are different than apps because they are natively distributed: even if some are services targeted to the individual and whose interaction is a solitary experience, they are still made for, and often by, a large group of people all over the world. The sense of belonging to a community is more important in these Dapps as users will need to bond to a decentralized brand and product. That doesn\u2019t mean to bake in the Dapp a social network, although some might benefit from tighter integration with the community chat chosen by the project.Needless to say these ideas are pretty important for DAOs. Consider the following just as some generic suggestions within the more loosely interpretable objective of making users feel part of something bigger than themselves.\ud83d\udd11\ud83d\udd11 Principles \ud83d\udd11\ud83d\udd11Dapps front-end should: \u27a4 \ud83c\udf00 clarify how many other members there are in the community\u27a4 \ud83c\udf00 clarify who are the other members (choose appropriate categories)\u27a4 \ud83c\udf00 clarify the composition of the community (ie sub-groups and their power over the project)\u27a4 \ud83c\udf00 the greater mission of the project (if any) and how their participation contributes to its achievementHow > Examplesprovide a landing dashboard with statistics about unique token holders or number of members of a Dapp or DAOadopt the transparency principle and show especially all information that could be derived by the users themselves by analyzing the Blockchain: \u2014 token wealth distribution,  \u2014 adoption time graphs,  \u2014 token holder since block XX and yyyy-mm-dd etcin DAOs consider enriching the information with anything that might be relevant (if available) like:  \u2014 kind of members (ie # of breeders vs non-breeders in Crypto Kitties, or # of musicians and # of listeners in Music/ART Dapps like UJO Music, stakers vs non-stakers etc) \u2014 staking distribution statistics  \u2014 maybe geographic locations / time zones?,  \u2014 maybe sex, ages? (but only if it does makes sense to your community, and if it\u2019s not offensive or detrimental to the adoption of your Dapp)Obviously search for the categories that are appropriate and relevant to your project: for instance, it\u2019s my personal opinion that in DAOs the sex and ages are not relevant information, even counterproductive to the idea of creating permissionless and unbiased societies, but maybe they are very pertinent in projects like SpankChain.maybe allow users to choose their own tags, categories, bio description etc.: each member can have different identities in different projects. This already hints at other principles about identities that will be presented in the future.\ud83d\udccc back to cheatsheet11 \u2014 Other Future Design PrinciplesAs you might have understood, the previous principle requires some more thoughts around Identities, Reputation and Governance. The first two are universally useful in many community driven apps but they will be fundamental for Token Curated Registries (TCR) and, probably, for many DAOs and other crypto-primitives.These principles deserve their own analysis and space, and this post is already too long.In the future I\u2019ll analyze Web3 Design Principles for:- Identities and Reputation- Governance - Wallets- Exchanges- ICO & Token Sales Mechanics- Token MechanicsNext StepsIt is clear that the requirements of \u201cextreme transparency\u201d proposed in these Web3 Design principles, create quite a burden for Dapp developers who are today more focused on solving many other parts of their projects.  \u2014 Bootstrap like libraryIt is therefore obvious that there should be a standard toolset that developers could plug and play into their Dapps and maybe interface their calls to the web3 library and get, for free, all these transparency services for their users. I\u2019m imagining something like a Bootstrap like library for the Web3 era (\u201cChainstrap\u201d? it\u2019s a bit too hard core, right? :P )\u2014 Independent browser pluginMaybe it\u2019s even advisable that there should be an independent tool that does offer users the advantages of the Web3 Design Principles wither the Dapp creator wants or not; a \u201ctransparency enforcer\u201d of sorts, that could allow to identify malicious or sloppy Dapps by their degree of compliancy with some of the principles.In this case it would probably be appropriate to create a browser plugin that injects its code into the Dapp and provides the chain-view functionality and maybe even a quick certification of the degree of transparency and trustworthiness of the Dapp.\u2014 Custom ServicesMoreover in these principles there are many potentials for services, even commercial ones that don\u2019t yet exist today.Many options.

There are a lot of fascinating features and benefits that blockchain technology brings into our lives. Nevertheless, the underlying idea is always the same; a transaction should be posted into a blockchain and mined in order to transfer crypto funds or execute any other function of a smart-contract.For some applications and online services, it is crucial to know the current state of a user\u2019s wallet or any transactions resulting from a user\u2019s actions. There are a lot of web services that allow developers to get details about wallets and transactions via JSON API, such as BlockCypher. However, there were few, if any, places to see all the currencies and tokens needed in one place.In this article, I will shed light on how do we deal with this at Pixel Point.Different projects \u2014 same tasksEvery blockchain uses different consensus protocols, but in terms of wallet and transaction watching, they all have a lot in common. Determining of the moment of funds transfer and verifying that the transaction has gained the number of confirmations needed for security reasons is a typical task for crypto projects.Therefore, the task of crypto assets tracking can be split into two parts. First, watch the wallet for incoming transfers and get one that matches our filter criteria. Second, use the transaction hash of the transfer and watch for its confirmations.Tracking ETH transactionsLet\u2019s start from the currency of the Ethereum blockchain\u2013Ether. Thanks to the efforts of the Ethereum development team and the open source community (which I count myself as part of), we have quite an impressive number of Web3 implementations:Python Web3.pyHaskell hs-web3Java web3jScala web3j-scalaPurescript purescript-web3PHP web3.phpPHP ethereum-phpSwift web3swiftHowever, the original and most popular one is JavaScript implementation, which is called web3.js. So let us use this powerful tool for working directly with Ethereum blockchain nodes and see how it works:npm install web3ETH transactions subscriptionsWeb3 API doesn\u2019t allow you to subscribe directly to a wallet\u2019s incoming transactions, so to solve our particular problem, we have to use a different strategy. First, we subscribe to all pending transactions, then we filter them by the sender\u2019s wallet address and certain other criteria.Web3.js allows us to talk directly to an Ethereum node via multiple protocols, including HTTP and WebSockets. For example, I use Rinkeby Testnet and nodes provided by Infura. However, you a free to use any other provider, including local nodes.In the function shown below, a new web3 instance with the WebSockets provider is created and used to establish a subscription to newly created transactions in blockchain. This instance is called pending.A subscription object can be created using two methods, subscribe() and unsubscribe(). Both of them accept a callback function to handle errors and any results of subscribing. There are two events that we can handle with subscriptions to pending transactions: data and error. Certainly, data is the essential event that we need for finding the transfer.A data event handler only has one input parameter, which represents a transaction hash and checks every transaction for compliance with our search criteria when we need more details than just a hash. That\u2019s where a different web3.js method, getTransaction(), can be used for reading transaction details. As this is an asynchronous call, I simply wrap it into a try-catch statement and await for the response. You can find the response object format in the official documentation for web3 here.Once a response is received and the transaction matches our filter conditions, we need to initiate the transaction confirmation process and cancel the subscription by calling its unsubscribe() method. If we don\u2019t have a transaction that satisfies our filter, we simply return from function to stay subscribed.The function is shown below, but also you could get full workable blockchain tracker example source code here.Please note that the above examples uses HttpProvider to get transaction details, because the risk of having a connection error with WebSockets is much higher. I had at least two errors during a thirty-minute observation with WebSocketProvider and none with HttpProvider.ETH transactions confirmations countingOnce we determine which transaction we need to track, we can start monitoring the confirmations until they reach the needed amount.There is a very simple way of determining a confirmations count basing on the block number in which a transaction was initially mined. The confirmations number is the difference between the current block number and the transaction block number. To get it, I suggest using a helper function which is outlined below.As the result of calling this function, we get an integer value that represents the confirmations count. Some projects require 100 confirmations, some fewer than 10, which is why we have to use this function recursively.In the following example, I call getConfirmations() via the setTimeout() function, but you can implement it in other ways too.I picked 10 as the default number of confirmations needed and set a 30 second interval, which is slightly more than Ethereum\u2019s block mining time (10\u201319 seconds).Tracking ERC20 tokensKnowing that ERC20 tokens are built on Ethereum as smart contracts, it may seem easy at first glance to track as Ether. Finding incoming transactions to a wallet with a certain crypto amount is different from Ether, because the transaction\u2019s recipient address will always be a smart contract\u2019s address. However, for each token transfer made, a special token contract\u2019s function is called. This function calls Transfer events on blockchain when it succeeds and all events are logged by blockchain, becoming accessible at any time.Our goal is to capture a transaction that meets the requirements the moment it gets posted to blockchain, so we are going to use the same WebSocketProvider. But, instead of subscription objects, we will instantiate token contract objects and listen for transfer events.A token contract is needed to subscribe and parse event data, as row data is in hexadecimal format and is therefore not readable to humans. For instantiation of the contract object, we require a token\u2019s JSON ABI (see example) and the Ethereum address the contract is deployed at.The web3.js API allows us to filter events by indexed parameters of the event. In the case of a transfer event, such parameters are _from, _to, and _value. While setting the options object for event subscriptions, we also can set the number of blocks to start looking for events.As we filter transfer events, we will get the sought-for transaction once it appears on blockchain and we can then proceed to the confirmation stage.A transaction object of Ether transfer is subject to the same rules as a Transfer transaction, which means we can apply exactly the same confirmEtherTransaction() function as we did with the Ether transaction in the above example.Final thoughtsThese examples show how to specifically track ERC20 Token transfers, but the same technique can be applied to any other smart contract\u2019s functions depending on your business needs. I have summed up the examples above in a simple node.js service, which can serve as a starting point to blockchain exploration.We created a special repository with full working examples that describes all states from this article.

In October 2017, after believing I knew somewhat enough to express my opinion publicly, I decided to make a post that criticized how everybody wants to use blockchains everywhere, even on non-existing use cases.Ever since, I\u2019ve been consistently writing about technical matters of blockchains, trying to simplify often complex terms and explain them to the public.This post will be different. I will not go through any wild blockchain lingo, or try to explain how Ethereum or any other cryptocurrency works.Instead, I\u2019ll first remind you about the history of the web until today.Then, I will create a narrative in the near future, where blockchain technology has weaved into our lives in such a seamless way, much the same as the internet has in 2018.If you just want to read my fictional fantasy of the future, feel free to skip to the last section \u201cBeyond Web3.0 \u2014 A look in the future\u201dEnjoy.Web1.0ENIAC was as big as a roomContrary to today\u2019s pocket computers (that smartphone you\u2019re reading this post from), computers around the 1950s were huge devices, that could fill an entire room and were available only to scientists or academics. The term \u201cinternet\u201d, let alone \u201cpeer-to-peer network\u201d, was not even an idea at that time.Around 1969, a military research program called ARPANET was launched by the Defense Advanced Rese arch Projects Agency (DARPA) which promoted the sharing of super-computers amongst military researchers in the United States. ARPANET was the precursor of today\u2019s internet.Fast forward to 1993, the first GUI browser, NCSA Mosaic gets released. In 1995 Netscape Browser was released, which marks the time when the internet started going mainstream.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Internet_usageWeb2.0The next iteration of the Web brought on the rise of corporate internet giants such as Google, Facebook and Amazon. In addition, e-Banking services started to become available, allowing electronic cross border payments. Websites such as Wikipedia, YouTube became the standard places to look for information (or funny videos).Paying our respects to some ancestors of today\u2019s popular sites:Youtube and MSN Hotmail, try to hold your tears of nostalgiaFacebook and social media allowed any person to connect with other individuals around the world, revolutionizing how social relationships are made and maintained. Amazon started as a book company and now sells pretty much anything, from books to cloud services.

Bitcoin revolutionized finance. Soon after, people realized blockchains are useful for more than just money.Use cases included:Identity Services (Domain Registration, Title Registration)Logistics (Supply Chain Tracking)CrowdfundingGamblingSocial MediaPrediction marketsInternet of ThingsVoting\u2026the list goes onThere was a need for performing calculations in a transparent-trustless way that was not subject to censorship and centralization of power.This need got partially satisfied by the so-called colored coins, layers built on top of Bitcoin, by utilizing Bitcoin\u2019s scripting language to store extra data on the Bitcoin blockchain.Bitcoin was the opening act. That was the beginning of Web3.0.The need for more complex, general purpose computations on a blockchain eventually gave birth to projects such as Ethereum which featured Smart Contracts and coined the term Decentralized Applications (DApps).Over the last years, Ethereum\u2019s DApps have evolved massively.Smart Contracts started from simple code that was meant to store some value on the Ethereum Blockchain, as proof of existence.Then, they started being used as currencies, with the ERC20 spec becoming the standard for creating new currencies (tokens) on the Ethereum network.What followed was a series of innovations such as the conception of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) or Decentralized Exchanges (DEX).However, no matter how great the use cases and the potential benefit, today\u2019s DApps are still plagued by issues, among others, such as:Bad user experience \u2014 There are no uneducated users, there is just bad UX.Bad scalability \u2014 Yeah, CryptoKitties again. And Proof of Work burning tons of energy.Bad security \u2014 what can get hacked, will get hacked if there\u2019s enough to gain (hint: TheDAO, Parity Wallet)Non-existing privacy \u2014 Some people actually care about that thing still.As long as these issues still exist, blockchain will not be able to have its own \u201cNetscape moment\u201d and become more than a buzzword for enterpreneurs, a way of trustless transactions for cypherpunks and a mess for developers.Beyond Web3.0 \u2014 A look in the futureWhat happens when the \u201cNetscape moment\u201d occurs? I\u2019ll now walk you through a typical day in the future where using DApps is a part of our daily life.Note: I\u2019m pretty sure my story is heavily influenced by a similar reddit comment I read once. I tried really hard to find it to no avail, so if you believe it reminds you of something and you have a source, please let me know!Disclaimer: I\u2019ll be using Ethereum-only projects for my story in order to focus on one community, this does not mean that another project can/will not be able to achieve a similar or even better outcome.The story will feature the following projects (again, this is not an exhaustive list): Status, Golem, Raiden, Aragon, Maker, Basic Attention Token, Request Network, Funfair.The year is 2040.You wake up at 8:00AM, and start to prepare breakfast.Notification pops up on your smartphone, the 3D model that you put up for rendering last night just got completed. 42 GNT got substracted from your Raiden payment channel; 1337 computers shared their computational power and worked together towards completing your task, among others. You will not make any other 3D-design work for the next month so you close the payment channel and pay a total of 2000 GNT for the rendering services you used last month.You also need to do some ID-related paperwork (law has advanced as well, but paper is still king) for your next DAO investment. You get into your electric car and start driving towards the city hall. Unfortunately, its battery is only at 30%. Your car (while being stuck in traffic; this will never get solved) makes a request to the decentralized energy marketplace and gets the battery life it needs from the car next to you for a small fee.Upon arriving to the city hall you verify your identity with your uPort ID and deposit 1000 ANT as initial stake in the company you invested. Immediately you are allowed to vote on the next board decision.Next up, you get notified about the release of the 20th edition of \u201cMastering Ethereum\u201d by Andreas Andonopoulos. Quickly browsing to OpenBazaar you buy it with Ether.You have some free time, so you decide to work on your freelance gigs. After finishing all the orders, you send requests (the new term for invoice) and get paid in REQ for all your hard work.However, REQ has not been performing very well, and rumor is that it might have up to 0.4% volatility over the next week (thanks to Maker and Digix, most cryptocurrencies at the time are stable coins, and any variation above 0.25% is considered dangerous)Using your favorite DEX, you immediately trade REQ for another coin of your preference. Everything happens in milliseconds, since near-instant consensus is achieved due to scientific breakthroughs in Proof of Stake algorithms.It is now late, so you decide to hang out with friends and listen to Gramatik\u2019s latest album which you support by holding GRMTK coins. Alternatively, you view content on your favorite video-hosting platform, and you support the content creators by tipping them with BAT. Or well, if you are the gambling type, you open up a Fate Channel on Funfair and spin that provably-fair roulette.All interactions, payments and communication needed for the above acts are made through the Status app which seamlessly integrates with the Ethereum ecosystem and is used in the same scale as WeChat was used in China before the \u201cCryptoApocalypse\u201d (circa 2034, after the Chinese mining industry fell apart). All transactions are private, thanks to ZK-Snarks. Quantum computers are still decades away, and Shor\u2019s algorithm still hasn\u2019t factored more than 3-digit numbers.No middle men. Decentralized. Fee-less.We are the beginning of Web3.ConclusionThat\u2019s it! I hope you liked the historical review, along with the small fictional story I came up with.Big thanks to Status for letting me take part in this contest. Best of luck to all participants.Remember where we are, this is a turning point in history \u2014 probably.Shameless plugI am an Electrical & Computer Engineering Major from Greece.

Ethers.js has every feature available in web3 (and more!), has been in active development for +2 years, includes extensive test-cases, and is entirely MIT licensed.In short, ethers.js is an alternative to web3, the most commonly used library for ethereum applications. We are committed to ensuring the continued development of this library and its related suite of open-source development tools, and will be hosting each stable release of these code-bases on our L4 github account.What makes ethers.js great:ENS names are first-class citizensIn ethers.js, you can use an ENS name in place of a contract address \u2014 a feature not currently available in web3.This can be useful in many situations. For instance, a developer writing an application that needs to call the ENS resolver can simply use \u201cresolver.eth\u201d rather than enter the actual contract address (\u201c0x5FfC014343cd971B7eb70732021E26C35B744cc4\u201d). If the actual contract address of the resolver were ever updated, an application whose code reads \u201cresolver.eth\u201d would not need to be updated, as the owner of that ENS name would redirect it (assuming you trust them!). An application using raw contract addresses would have to update that address.2. It\u2019s tiny.Ethers.js is only 77kb compressed.3. Separation of concerns \u2014 key management and stateOne major difference between ethers.js and web3 is how they handle key management and interaction with the ethereum blockchain. Web3 assumes that there is a local node connected to the application. That node is assumed to store keys, sign transactions, and interact with and read the ethereum blockchain. In reality, this is not often the case \u2014 most users are not running geth locally. Metamask effectively emulates that environment through a browser application, and so most web3 apps require Metamask to hold keys, sign transactions, and interact with the ethereum mainnet.Ethers.js takes a different approach that we believe gives developers more flexibility. Ethers.js separates the \u201cnode\u201d into two separate roles:A \u201cwallet\u201d that holds keys and signs transaction, andA \u201cprovider\u201d that serves as an anonymous connection to the ethereum network, checking state and sending transactionsThis allows developers to manage these two roles discretely \u2014 perhaps using Infura as the provider, and a hardware device for the wallet.4. Extensive documentationReally, there\u2019s a lot.5. A large number of test cases (9,513 and counting)Richard has written an extraordinary number of test cases for ethers.js. Ethers.js passes all of them. Ethers.js uses Travis-ci, meaning that every time new code is added to the repo, all tests are automatically and publicly run.6. Ethers.js is entirely MIT licensed, including all dependenciesWe want developers to use ethers.js to build products and to adapt it to their own ends. That\u2019s why it was released under the most permissive open-source license available. Under the MIT license, you are free to do pretty much anything you want with ethers.js, so long as you include the copyright notice.Why make an alternative to web3?It\u2019s been more than two years since Ethereum launched, and we\u2019ve come a long way in our understanding of the protocol, availability of development tools, and diversity of client software.Web3 is an awesome library that has facilitated an entire generation of ethereum applications so far. But we believe open-source ecosystems are strongest when there are a variety of different tools available to developers which offer different features, make different trade-offs and even, to some extent, compete with one another.We\u2019re proud to offer ethers.js to the ethereum community under the MIT license, and hope that it\u2019s useful to developers building the next generation of decentralized applications.In the coming weeks, we\u2019ll also be releasing a suite of command line tools built around ethers.js \u2014 more announcements to come!Most recent version of ethers.js", "responses": 5, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Development", "Libraries", "Open Source", "Blockchain"]}, {"title": "Implications of Web 3.0", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@quantalysus/implications-of-web-3-0-b0aa4b185c6d?source=search_post", "author_name": "Quantalysus", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@quantalysus", "publish_date": "2018-07-27", "last_modified_date": "2018-07-27", "readtime": "5.16", "claps": 1772, "voters": 189, "content": "Implications of Web 3.0QuantalysusFollowJul 27, 2018 \u00b7 6 min readA change is coming to the internet as we know it today. In fact, the shift may already be underway with the advent of cryptoassets. In Web 1.0 consumers accessed the web through dial-up modems and read information on static websites. Users, both consumer and enterprise alike, had to settle for read-only websites and subpar shopping cart experiences. While laughable today, it was the dawn of the information age. We have seen what information access can do to societies. The Gutenberg printing press produced books en masse and disseminated information at the speed physical distribution. With Web 1.0, information exchanged between two parties at the speed of 56 kbit/s, the bandwidth enabled by consumer grade modems at the time. An average 2 gigabyte film would take a little over 85 days to download back then. We\u2019ve come a long way since. The internet today, broadly referred to as Web 2.0, allows users to interact with web services such as Facebook or Google from a range of devices including mobile phones, laptops, tablets, and home IoT devices. But even at the beginning of Web 2.0, user interfaces did not have the spit and polish of today\u2019s services nor could you access your social media profile from a handheld device.The first blogging services such as Live Journal and Blogger brought the net from a \u201cread-only\u201d era to a \u201cread-write-publish\u201d era. Newer concepts such as collaboration, machine learning, and mobility would shift Web 2.0 to Web 2.5. Here, companies were able to work within the same document simultaneously and file storage was shifted to third party drives such as Google Drive or iCloud. Mobility turned every day bloggers from desktop keyboard mashers into poolside WordPress impresarios. Machine learning, IoT, and cryptoassets present a number of directions the next internet will move into. AI/machine learning present opportunities for accelerated trend recognition and improved service delivery. IoT devices compliment the screen driven interactions we have become accustomed to. Ordering house supplies is as easy as shouting your order out to Alexa from the comfort of your living room.Web 3.0 is not just technological evolution but also a significant transformation for businesses and consumers alike. In the era of Web 3.0 real world assets may be tokenized enabling fractional and cross-border ownership. Investors will be able to participate in the infrastructure that powers the next wave of applications. In the next few sections below I explore a few macro implications cryptoassets brings to Web 3.0.Digital Asset SovereigntyCryptoassets are an emerging category of digital assets. The definition of an asset is property owned by a person or a company. Consider your Facebook profile for a minute,if you haven\u2019t already deleted it. If you are a regular Facebook user you spend the time to post about your everyday life or scroll through its News Feed feature to quickly grab the headlines of what is going on in your social circle. Yet the Facebook profile is not truly yours. The terms and conditions set by Facebook Incorporated dictate whether you are within the bounds of the rules they have set. Violate those terms and you may quickly find a deactivated or suspended account. Cryptoassets differ greatly in that ownership is dictated by cryptography.Bitcoin, for example, was the first real world example of a decentralized digital asset with a high degree of censorship resistance. The Bitcoin network is operated, maintained, and secured by the thousands of nodes that comprise the entire network. Attacking the network successfully would require a high degree of well coordinated takedowns or manipulation of said nodes. Combined with financial incentives to run honestly, nodes run as intended. The end result is a network transacting and creating digital assets. Bitcoin owners are secure in their ownership. There are no terms and conditions to abide by in Bitcoin\u2019s permissionless network. As long as Bitcoin owners have their private key they can access their funds. This type of censorship resistance leads to digital asset sovereignty.Lowering switching costs and intertwined competitionIf you played World of Warcraft when you were younger you no doubt built up some impressive fortresses and banked some serious coin along the way. All that time and energy spent amassing an in-game fortune evaporated as soon as you stopped playing. Moving to a new game meant you had to start all over again. There is a price, or a cost, to pay for switching over. These are switching costs. Digital currencies such as Bitcoin open up the possibility of game players moving assets from Game A over to Game B. If both games were developed by different game publishers it opens up an entire new world of business possibilities. Activision could entice Call of Duty players to also pick up another title in their library such as Destiny without setting their players back in time. Players could simply buy, sell, or transfer ActivisionCoin from Call of Duty over to Destiny. Even stranger, players owning ActivisionCoin could then trade on external exchanges to participate in a competitor economy such as Electronics Arts games. Not only is Activision competing against EA for game sales, but now they may be competing at the level of in-game economies, or better said inter-game economies.Paradox of ChoiceColumbia University professor Sheena Iyengar conducted a research study on choice. In this study, the professor and her research assistants set up a stand filled with jams. Every few hours they would have either six or 24 james on display. The larger display of jams drew in sixty percent of people passing by while the smaller display brought in forty percent. Of the people stopping by the smaller display of six jams, 30% actually purchased a jam. The larger display resulted in 3% purchasing. This dramatic difference in purchasing behavior suggests that more may be less.In the future, a tokenized economy may present the paradox of choice. If every digital service had a token and its own mini-economy, it may potentially raise more problems than solutions. Cryptocurrency exchanges today have dozens of coins to trade. Even more confusing are the potentially hundreds of exchanges each with their own jurisdiction trading restrictions, fee structures, and liquidity variances. Web 3.0 may open up new forms of value and ownership but it may also slow down the ease of conducting business.Stubborn Networks and PrivacyDecentralized networks may suffer higher latency but also exhibit operational resilience. Would-be attackers would need to overtake significant portions of the network for a successful takedown. Data breaches such as the hack of Equifax may be more difficult to pull off in networks where personal financial data is sovereign to the user. Research is still ongoing and several projects are working on increasing privacy measures. Companies are sure to learn lessons from these new technologies and stand to benefit from protecting their precious intellectual property. Consumers will also benefit as they will not only have the option to use centralized services such as Facebook but also the ability to opt-out of privacy invading products. By owning their own data and storing it on a decentralized network, consumers can opt-in to the services they want while worrying less about system wide theft or disruption.Web 3.0 is hereDevelopers building applications have more choices to consider than ever. The applications of today and tomorrow will need to be delivered on multiple form factors from mobile phones to screenless IoT devices. We will unfortunately still be advertised to through use of cookie trackers but we will also be intelligently marketed to because we chose to share our information on protected decentralized services. Our digital estate will be ours to keep and not subject to forfeiture, confiscation, and suspension.

At the time, he was working at CERN, the largest particle physics factory in the world. The stated goal of the institute was to accelerate science, using the most sophisticated scientific instruments to study the simplest particles. In 1988, the institute completed construction on the LEP Tunnel, a 27 kilometer ring which came together with just one centimeter of error. This was the largest civil engineering project in Europe (intended to study not-quite-as-large particles \u2014 electrons).LEP tunnel construction process (Credit: CERN)The problem Tim Berners Lee found was much simpler than particle physics: loss of information. Several thousand people were working at CERN in 1989. Due to the size and complexity of teams, people often had struggles recalling information and knowledge from past projects. While these were surmountable barriers, an issue of high turnover was nearly impossible to manage. In a proposal named \u2018Information Management\u2019 released at the time, Berners Lee shared his thoughts on the issue at-hand.When two years is a typical length of stay, information is constantly being lost. The introduction of the new people demands a fair amount of their time and that of others before they have any idea of what goes on. The technical details of past projects are sometimes lost forever, or only recovered after a detective investigation in an emergency. Often, the information has been recorded, it just cannot be found. \u2014 Information Management: A ProposalHe proposed a solution. Using a (relatively) new technology called \u2018hypertext\u2019, create an information management system which allowed users to access data in a free-flowing, decentralized manner.\u201cVague but exciting\u2026\u201d is a famous early response to Berners Lee\u2019s proposal. Eventually, the paper evolved into an interweaving set of technologies which created today\u2019s internet. From W3C, here are three of the most prominent, used by billions of people today:(Credit: CERN)HTML: Hypertext Markup Language. A formatting language for the web.URI: Uniform Resource Identifier. A unique \u201caddress\u201d to identify each resource on the web. Commonly called \u2018a URL\u2019.HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol. Allows for the retrieval of linked resources across the web.These technologies underpin everything we do on a computer. They were the seeds of our journey to reorganize information, an effort which has proven fruitful\u2026yet perhaps as complex as particle physics.If you took Tim Berners Lee through a time machine from 1989 to 2018, he\u2019d probably think it\u2019s been an eventful three (three?!) decades. He\u2019d marvel at the advances the internet has helped humankind to achieve \u2014 the billions, the inspiring, the novel. How the idea of \u2018Information Management\u2019 at CERN would unlock unmeasurable innovation.In this fictional example, he\u2019d probably need a drink, a walk, and at least a few deep breaths to fully grasp the impact of the internet. He\u2019d also probably be surprised to see a few big names in the middle of everything.FANG (Credit: CNBC)Then, he\u2019d definitely say: something isn\u2019t right here.Before going there, it does us well to review the history of the web. What happened after Berners Lee took the internet public? What were web1 and web2? What\u2019s wrong with what we\u2019re currently doing which leads so many to believe we need a whole new one, web3?Logically, per Jamie Burke at Outlier Ventures:Web 1.0 was the read-only webWeb 2.0 was the read-write webWeb 3.0 is an unmediated read-write webLet\u2019s explore.Web1: The Read-Only Web \ud83d\udcd6Web1 was the age of digitization. We took our books, our research, and our lives \u2018onto the web\u2019. The web turned out to be a place where information was easier to retrieve than any filing cabinet, ever. Unfathomable reams of information were stored online. Encyclopedias, medical records, and entire libraries were put away into floppy disks and hard drives.Per a 2015 estimate, if you went to the web only to read, you\u2019d find about 305,500,000,000 pages of content (280 million copies of Atlas Shrugged).If you could print out the whole Internet, how many pages would it be?www.washingtonpost.coHowever, in the early days, one didn\u2019t expect to contribute much to this collection of information. Web1 was an imitation of the outer world \u2014 online instead of in real life, but not yet a reimagining of how the invention could be novelly used.One senses, however, that the medium of the web has not been exploited to its fullest if the best we can say about historians\u2019 use of this highly advanced computer network is that it has become a giant, global fax machine. \u2014 Daniel Cohen, History and the Second Decade of the Web (2004)That doesn\u2019t mean developers weren\u2019t building in the background. Subtly, great minds were moving the web forward. Technologies improved, and we were ushered into Web2.Web2: The Read-Write Web \ud83d\udcda\ud83d\udd8d\ud83d\udcdd\ud83c\udfbcRemember back in the day when every time you clicked something on a website, the whole page refreshed? Side note: is it too early to call the mid-2000\u2019s \u2018back in the day\u2019? \ud83e\udd14Slowly, and then all-at-once, internet browsers improved. AJAX calls augmented CGI scripts, and applications began sending data back and forth without disrupting the entire web page. You could now click one button to \u2018digg\u2019 a post (see below). Web experiences blossomed.\u201cDigg in 2006, a prolific example of \u2018Web 2.0\u2019 interactivity.\u201d (Credit: Taylor Gerring of the Ethereum Foundation)New applications were built with a focus on interaction. Posting, upvoting, hearting, pinning, tweeting, liking, commenting, and clapping all joined the lexicon. Blogging exploded in 2004. Low-stress options to \u2018write\u2019 on the internet grew, and continue to grow easier to this day.Facebook became a hallmark company of Web2, where users became creators of trillions of rows of data. Google and Amazon navigated from Web1 to Web2, using data \u2018written\u2019 by users based on their search history to better understand them, and by building products and services which met their needs.Software-as-a-Service exploded as a business model, as many companies built their business on building applications and then eloquently managing consumer data within them, for a fee.Emerging Problems With Web2Quietly \u2014 almost imperceptibly \u2014 an interesting dilemma arose. When creating this read-write web, a non-trivial question skirted underneath the covers. Who owns all this data?With [Web 2] online SaaS, you have no control whatsoever. Initially, people didn\u2019t realize this because SaaS was a new and shiny thing. Over the last couple of years, people are realizing this is the actual problem.Even if the people in these organizations have good intentions, their incentive isn\u2019t naturally on the side [of the users].With web companies: \u201cyou are not their customers, therefore you are their product.\u201d \u2014 Vitalik Buterin, on Unchained with Laura ShinAn interesting plot line emerges. While using many amazing, world-changing software products, users quietly lost control of their data.To illustrate: Facebook owns much of the data on your social graph. Even if you are frustrated with Facebook (for any reason), you can\u2019t quit without giving up that data. There is no way to \u2018export\u2019, or otherwise \u2018exit\u2019. Ownership is tied to the platform.While many companies are able to make a data pull on you, you are not able to do so on yourself.On a surface level, this isn\u2019t a problem. Personally speaking, these companies use my data better than I could! However, they also contain a complex group of stakeholders, each with their own goals. For public companies, maximizing shareholder value is one of them. Tim Berners-Lee (and many others) are not happy with the incentives this creates.\u201cShow me the incentive and I will show you the outcome.\u201d \u2014 Charlie Munger, Berkshire HathawayIt\u2019s pretty easy to see (with the benefit of hindsight) what the read-write web has allowed. Instead of getting on the internet to consume content, we have been given the keys to create. We have built on platforms like Facebook and Twitter \u2014 where anyone with a laptop and internet can engage. Yet ultimately, the engagement is not our own. The platforms are the owners.Web3: The \u2018Unmediated\u2019 Read-Write WebAbout ten years ago, Tim Berners Lee spoke about a concept he called \u2018linked data\u2019 which could save the internet\u2019s data problem.Despite the inarguable benefits the Web provides, until recently the same principles that enabled the Web of documents to flourish have not been applied to data\u2026The Web of Data also opens up new possibilities for domain-specific applications. Unlike Web 2.0 mashups which work against a fixed set of data sources, Linked Data applications operate on top of an unbound, global data space. This enables them to deliver more complete answers as new data sources appear on the Web.At around the same time as linked data research began, Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin. Fast forward ten years, and it seems that Berners Lee\u2019s ideas spiritually \u2018link\u2019 with cryptocurrencies in many ways.What do we want Web 3 to do?Here\u2019s some rapid fire of what the hope is for the future of the web.Data to users: Information is owned by the users, and provided to corporations, businesses, or services who hope to benefit the userCensorship resistance: No government, company, or institution should control your access to information (1, 2, 3)Align users and platforms: Create \u2018cryptonetworks\u2019 where users and platforms creators have symbiotic, instead of competitive, relationshipsTransparent, open networks: \u201cFirst, the contract between cryptonetworks and their participants is enforced in open source code. Second, they are kept in check through mechanisms for \u2018voice\u2019 and \u2018exit.\u2019\u201d \u2014 Chris Dixon, (4)Global interactivity: The ability to transact value, information, or assets, large or small, with anyone with internet, anywhere, for a low costSelf-sovereign identity: Giving you the ability to own, see, and understand your entire digital identity (see: uPort website)Push, not pull: \u2018Push\u2019 your information to trusted sources, instead of \u2018pulling\u2019 from other sources who ultimately own the data (5)What Future Will this Create?\u201cChange the incentives, change the world.\u201d \u2014 Niran BabalolaThe belief is that web3 is a chance to build a better, fairer system. This is not to be confused with equality of income or outcomes \u2014 but, at least, more equal opportunity.To be clear, some of these benefits have been touted before when discussing earlier WWW iterations. Will these changes succeed? Will they lead to a better world? These are unanswered technical, economic, political, and philosophical questions which lie in wait. It\u2019s likely that there will be unintended consequences.We hope Web3 will be a more democratic iteration of our web. We believe incentives better align user with creator. If there\u2019s one thing that\u2019s on our side, it\u2019s that open has always beaten closed, given a long enough timescale.We\u2019re at the beginning.

In particular, it takes a deep dive into the often overlooked multichain Polkadot paper released back in late 2016, highlighting its significance within an increasingly complex set of heterogenous environments.UPDATE: we now operate a popular chat room on Web 3 at http://tiny.cc/web3chat \u2014 join us there! :)The Web 3.0 Stack, hugely simplified (believe it or not).Blockchain 2017: A Confusing MessWhile taking part in various blockchain-related enterprise working groups, I often get the chance to observe many new entrants exhorting the virtues of their wares to a relatively non-technical, corporate audience. Putting myself in the shoes of such high-flying decision-makers, I can only imagine how utterly bemused I would be by the dizzying array of acronyms, promises and variety of software on display (anyone up for some buzzword bingo?).Dozens of implementations of enterprise chains, public chains, private/permissioned chains, state channels all battle it out, backed by a flurry of consensus protocols including PoA, PoS, PoW, PoET over SGX, and many, many others. Colossal numbers of transactions per second are allegedly promised over byzantine fault-tolerant networks, \u2018new\u2019 blockchains are introduced as having neither blocks nor chains, while some less than ingenuous players come dangerously close to describing the CAP theorem as having been relegated to something of a bygone era.And I have only touched on the consensus/state machine providers. To this menagerie of protocols, you also need to add every single decentralized file system, every decentralized messaging layer and yes, even the six or seven Dapp browsing options, all with their own quirks, proprietary integrations and sometimes even underlying cryptocurrencies.The Near Future: Fragmentation\u2026 and more FragmentationIn this post, I put forward that even the topmost expert in the field of blockchains simply cannot with 100% certainty define the stack of protocols that will form the future \u201cWeb 3.0\u201d. For those not yet familiar with \u201cWeb 3.0\u201d, it\u2019s fair to say that for most of us who became passionate about Ethereum did so because of its promising vision of a truly decentralized Web, one of a massively multi-user application platform that has no need for centralized services such as Amazon or Google. It was, in fact, Gavin Wood\u2019s seminal post in April 2014 (later followed by a less technical version) that built the movement leading to protocols such as Shh (Whisper), Bzz (Swarm) and today\u2019s ever-accelerating formation of companies around such a stack (Status.im, Etherisc, etc.)But just like it took 20 years to settle on an HTML/JavaScript/CSS presentation layer over HTTP to form \u2018Web 2.0\u2019, it might (and certainly will) take a significant amount of time to define the optimal Dapp distribution mechanism for \u2018Web 3.0\u2019. In fact, I foresee very significant fragmentation amongst so-called \u2018decentralized technologies\u2019 all pointlessly vying to take the crown in the coming three years, underpinned by rabid speculation around their underlying crypto-tokens.Web 3 as I used to present it in 2014 as part of my Ethereum slides. Graphic courtesy of Ian Meikle as conceptualised by Parity Technologies\u2019 Gavin WoodOf course, a lot of maximalists solely interested in the price of their favorite \u2018crypto\u2019 will react to this post with skepticism. They should perhaps stop getting their news from the self-titled \u2018gurus\u2019 and instead talk to the guys who actually write the code. Indeed, if you were to go check out the GitHub repositories of actual Dapps, you would find very few developers that are genuinely developing 100% on the EVM, or 100% on bitcoin, Zcash, etc.My company, Slock.it, like so many other blockchain startups, are for example already looking into state channels quite closely, as running everything on the Ethereum chain would be impractical for three very logical reasons:The first, but it is only temporary, is that it has gotten quite expensive to operate 100% on Ethereum due to a recently discovered oversight in the dynamic pricing of gas. As it stands, while the Ethereum theoretical gas price floor is its smallest denomination, or 1 Wei (well, technically 0), there is a hidden but very real economic floor, meaning the higher the price of Ether, the higher the opportunity cost of transactions. Admittedly, this can and will be sorted via a hard fork in the future, but it highlights that putting all your eggs in one basket may not be the wisest option.The second is that Ethereum never made the claim that their blockchain was to be a perfect, cheap, structured decentralized binary data container, or a scalable messaging layer, for that matter. To the contrary, the presence of a 3rd party decentralized storage system and messaging queue mechanism somewhere \u2018in the stack\u2019 was always part of its marketing materials that I helped evangelize during my time in the organization. That message of at least three protocols working in unison to deliver a revolutionary web experience still resonates just as well as it did back then. It is indeed hard to believe that the extraordinary sneak peak at Mist, the Dapp browser by Alex van de Sande already dates back to November 2014.Finally, the third reason is that as of today, like it or not, there is actual value in so-called \u2018consortium\u2019 or \u2018theme\u2019 chains. These provide both scalability and privacy options where public chains provide neither. Yes, it is true that I\u2019m the first one to argue that ultimately, public chain solutions will ultimately \u2018win\u2019. And yes, I\u2019m also the first one to encourage our corporate clients to make use of the public chain whenever possible. And yes, I have even been seen calling out corporates on their \u2018embrace, extend and extinguish\u2019 strategies demonstrated as part of some but not all enterprise blockchain initiatives. However, the fact remains: if we want privacy on a public chain where encrypted data can be processed by an autonomous smart contract, we\u2019re going to need something like homomorphic encryption or true, scalable zero knowledge solutions. Unfortunately, these technologies are not just years, but in fact potentially dozens of years away from becoming \u2018mainstream\u2019.Sticking to the Pragmatic.At the end of the day, even the largest enterprise understands they will need to link back to public chains and open platforms if they wish to survive in the long run. And ultimately, a common set of standards will form.In the meantime, the need for multichain/multiprotocol networks that divorce consensus engines from their state machine may appear \u2018unnecessary\u2019 to some, just like Ethereum\u2019s Turing completeness appeared \u2018unnecessary\u2019 to so many bitcoin maximalists at the time.Yet, every time a future Dapp announces its support for state channels, every time a hackathon entry decides to use Zcash to protect their users privacy, and every time a middle manager decides to build on top of Hyperledger because \u2018no one ever got fired for hiring IBM\u2019 \u2014 each of these scenarios increases the need for a multiprotocol layer and inches us towards a truly multichain future.The Polkadot project offers such a cross-chain communication layer which, just like Ethereum back in the days, has tremendous potential but carries a technical complexity which unfortunately detracts from its significance. In my next post, I will go through the whitepaper and transcribe some of its \u2018technobabble\u2019 to plain English so you can form your own opinion on its value proposition.Update: you now can read the next part of this series, \u201cWeb Three Revisited \u2014 Part Two: \u201cIntroduction to Polkadot: what it is, what it ain\u2019t\u201d.About the AuthorStephan Tual is the Founder and COO of Slock.it.Previously CCO for the Ethereum project, Stephan has three startups under his belt and brings 20 years of enterprise IT experience to the Slock .it project.Before discovering the Blockchain, Stephan held CTO positions at leading data analytics companies in London with clients including VISA Europe and BP.His current focus is on the intersection of blockchain technology and embedded hardware, where autonomous agents can transact as part of an optimal \u201cEconomy of Things\u201d.If you enjoyed reading this, please log in and click \u201cRecommend\u201d below.This will help to share the story with others.Twitter: @stephantualContact: stephan@slock.it", "responses": 4, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Bitcoin", "Polkadot", "Ethereum", "Web3"]}, {"title": "Scaling Web3 with SignTypedData", "post_link": "https://medium.com/metamask/scaling-web3-with-signtypeddata-91d6efc8b290?source=search_post", "author_name": "Dan Finlay", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@danfinlay", "publish_date": "2017-10-24", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-19", "readtime": "2.14", "claps": 1146, "voters": 147, "content": "Scaling Web3 with SignTypedDataDan FinlayFollowOct 24, 2017 \u00b7 3 min readPlease note: This is a very early stage feature, and the exact implementation may be subject to change! Do not use this method for production applications that you\u2019re not able to update should the API change in the future!There are a wide array of ways that Ethereum plans to scale, and it\u2019s a favorite topic of blockchain fans, because the scalability of the blockchain is a hard technical limit on how useful it can become.One of the easiest ways you can start scaling your application on Ethereum today, without waiting for any other technology to be available, is to construct mechanisms that allow users to sign state changes that aren\u2019t always submitted to the blockchain, but can be if needed, like a state channel. To make a working state channel today, there\u2019s no easier option than to take advantage of MetaMask\u2019s new signTypedData method.Originally proposed in EIP 712 by Leonid Logvinov of 0x, and then implemented for MetaMask by Sergey Ukustov of Machimony. This new method makes it easier than ever to create applications involving user signatures that:Represent structured data.Are human readable.Cannot impersonate Ethereum transactions.Are cheap to compute on-chain.In this article, you\u2019ll learn to show the MetaMask user something like this:Structured data user prompts that are cheap to compute on-chain? No way!The API is simple, and will be even simpler once it has been deployed in new versions of EthJS and Web3.js. In the meanwhile, using it exposes you to the lowest-level API that MetaMask gives you: The Ethereum Provider.You can find this code live online on github here.// A JS library for recovering signatures:const sigUtil = require('eth-sig-util')const msgParams = [  {    type: 'string',      // Any valid solidity type    name: 'Message',     // Any string label you want    value: 'Hi, Alice!'  // The value to sign }, {      type: 'uint32',      name: 'A number',      value: '1337'  }]   // Get the current account:web3.eth.getAccounts(function (err, accounts) {  if (!accounts) return  signMsg(msgParams, accounts[0])})function signMsg(msgParams, from) {  web3.currentProvider.sendAsync({    method: 'eth_signTypedData',    params: [msgParams, from],    from: from,  }, function (err, result) {    if (err) return console.error(err)    if (result.error) {      return console.error(result.error.message)    }    const recovered = sigUtil.recoverTypedSignature({      data: msgParams,      sig: result.result     })    if (recovered === from ) {      alert('Recovered signer: ' + from)    } else {      alert('Failed to verify signer, got: ' + result)    }  })}As you can see, in this we:Imported the signature recovery library eth-sig-util.Assembled parameters for the method.Retrieved the current user\u2019s address from the web3 API.Asked the user to sign those parameters.Using the parameters and the signature, we were able to verify this signature came from their address (and only their address!).Not only can you verify this data with JavaScript, you can also verify it in Solidity. Here is an example of verifying one of these signatures in Solidity. This can be useful for writing code for closing a state channel.I hope this has been useful to you, let us know if you have any questions, and if you create any sample examples you\u2019d like to share!", "responses": 7, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Metamask", "Cryptography"]}, {"title": "Web 3.0 Revisited \u2014 Part Two: \u201cIntroduction to Polkadot: what it is, what it ain\u2019t\u201d", "post_link": "https://blog.stephantual.com/web-three-revisited-part-two-introduction-to-polkadot-what-it-is-what-it-aint-657782051d34?source=search_post", "author_name": "Stephan Tual", "author_link": "https://blog.stephantual.com/@stephantual", "publish_date": "2017-07-09", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-21", "readtime": "10.4", "claps": 761, "voters": 171, "content": "Web 3.0 Revisited \u2014 Part Two: \u201cIntroduction to Polkadot: what it is, what it ain\u2019t\u201dStephan TualFollowJul 9, 2017 \u00b7 11 min readUPDATE: Join us the Web 3 Chat discussion: http://tiny.cc/web3chat, #polkadot channel. You can also ask questions on the Web 3 subredditDisclaimer: all opinions on this blog are mine and mine only. I write about projects I enjoy. Back in December 2013 I wrote extensively about a little-known project called Ethereum, which has often been misunderstood but worked out quite well. Others projects I have covered had their heart in the right place but missed the mark despite on-boarding some of the brightest minds in the field. My opinion does not represent the view of my employer, investors or partners. Finally, nothing written here should be construed as investment advice. And with this out of the way\u2026IntroductionIn my previous post, I highlighted the importance for both startups and corporates to stay chain and protocol agnostic at a time when fragmentation in our vertical is taking place at an exponential rate. We are at least years away from any form of generally accepted Dapp standardization in the same fashion *AMP is generally accepted as the archetypal model for web service stack as of 2017.The need for cross-chain communications has been present from day one, a need best exemplified by the original BTC Relay project, dating back mid-2015. Yet, if you think this blog post was about 2-way pegs and transferring value between chains, then this is exactly why you need to continue reading. Heterogenous multichain solutions are not just about \u2018making chains talk to each other\u2019, the way Vitalik\u2019s Ethereum whitepaper was not just about a \u2018better bitcoin\u2019.Let\u2019s dive into a vision of a fully decentralized \u201cfederation\u201d of chains, allowing both open and closed networks to have trust-free access to each other: not just for exchanging value, but also for processing data. Think killer apps which leverage both holy grails of scalability and privacy, but also benefit from pooled security and trust-free interchain \u2018transact-ability\u2019.On a side note\u2026If you\u2019re still not sure why such a solution needed, it\u2019s probably because you haven\u2019t yet hit the barriers of blockchain development. \u2018ICOs\u2019 and whitepapers are a dime a dozen these days, but in the corridors of conferences and at the offices of the companies actually building Web 3 solutions, blockchain maximalism is long dead. I think due to unprecedented price speculation, many hope \u2018everything\u2019 could be built on a single platform.The fact of the matter is that anyone serious about building Dapps will tell you that such an all-encompassing platform simply doesn\u2019t exist.Polkadot in a nutshellPolkadot is a creative commons protocol specification and a free and open source licensed project. It is a complementary protocol that will allow for different blockchains to leave their silos and interact seamlessly.Back in November last year, the Polkadot team released with surprisingly little fanfare their whitepaper describing a mechanism by which not only value, but also data could be shared back and forth across existing or future chains (dubbed \u2018parachains\u2019). In terms of use cases, we can imagine end users participating anonymously in an Ethereum smart contract driven token sales using Zcash coins, or encouraging the development of entirely new state machines more suitable for IoT scenarios. For example, such a state machine could present weaker guarantees on transaction ordering while increasing transaction throughput. These new chains could then settle their balances on the Ethereum public chain.I think the Polkadot paper did not register on many people\u2019s radars at the time of its release, simply because of the lack of marketing (Parity Technologies has a reputation for not engaging in the Twitter or Reddit \u2018games\u2019), the deafening noise from the bitcoin-heavy conversation regarding two-way pegs, and the lack of matching token sale regrettably deemed so necessary these days to attract attention of any kind.How does Polkadot achieve its goals? As Peter Czaban would say, \u201cit\u2019s a minimal global consensus layer, a future resistant way of enabling all autonomous agents to collaborate using rules executed by arbitrary state machines\u201d. But what about the rest of us that speak actual English? Well, what it does is allow for an easy solution to scaling by allowing multiple chains to share the same security layer without having to accrue mining resources themselves (the main challenge to the simplest chain scaling solution), AND without having to resort to merge-mining either.In other words, Polkadot is an innovative way to connect the hundreds of different technologies out there to each other. An \u201cInternet of Blockchains\u201d might be an adequate albeit slightly crude description.A better one might be, to quote Sunny Aggarwal, \u201ca pluggable consensus network\u201d \u2014 essentially each parachain gives up sovereignty in deciding chain finality in exchange for being able to talk to each other as part of a constellation of blockchains and other consensus at scale solutions.What Polkadot isn\u2019tPolkadot is not another Turing complete blockchain, even if it comes from the main developer of Ethereum, Gavin Wood. It doesn\u2019t run code, nor is it a good means to pay for groceries.It\u2019s not a particularly new concept, even though it\u2019s unique in its early implementation. The Pokadot paper does a good job in that regard, crediting the work by Max Kaye as well as Chain Fibers dating back 2014.It\u2019s not finished either. Parts of it are PoC phase but most of it won\u2019t be released for many months and potentially even years after the project is funded \u2014 making it open to your comments and suggestions.It\u2019s certainly not \u2018magic\u2019. Once your wrap your head around how it relays data from A to B it\u2019s actually relatively simple to understand and eventually master.And finally, it\u2019s not a competitor to Ethereum, Bitcoin, or any other chain \u2014 in fact, it\u2019s even compatible with other cross-chain solutions such as Cosmos.Polkadot vs\u2026When I helped launch Ethereum, I spent much of time comparing it to other platforms in order to position it. Looking back, things were much simpler then \u2014 considering how fragmented the landscape has become, this section will form the lion\u2019s share of this first, introductory blog post.Vs. Cross chain solutionsFirst off, let\u2019s check how Polkadot compares to Cosmos and other \u2018existing\u2019 cross-chain solutions. These are considerably simpler from a design standpoint, and therefore less likely to have bugs and/or delays in their deployment. But simply put, Cosmos and others focus on value transfer between chains. Polkadot, on the other hand, is more generalized to allow for cross-blockchain interactions between disparate smart contracts.There are many uses cases, especially in the IoT space where my company Slock.it operates, where the main challenge is transferring data and executing function calls between platforms. For example, I might want to find, from an Ethereum smart contract, the GPS coordinates of a given object that\u2019s registered on Hyperledger.The second benefit of Polkadot over these solutions is its shared security model. Writing connectors is one thing, but building a new, vertical specific blockchain is difficult \u2014 very difficult in fact. As a developer I\u2019d much prefer to focus on delivering value add to my customers in the form of feature set, and not having to worry about hitting the correct threshold of mining power. Cross chain solutions cannot help me here, but Polkadot can. That\u2019s not to say the two are at odds \u2014 in fact, Cosmos developers recently announced they were looking forward to work with the Polkadot team, demonstrating a much needed healthy mindset of cooperation, not competition.Vs State ChannelsIt\u2019s no secret I\u2019m a big proponent of state channels. How does Polkadot compare to projects such as the Raiden network? Well, state channels hold a major requirement for deposits to be in place if you want them to be really secure. This works great for projects such as Slock.it where deposits are intrinsic to our business model, but it doesn\u2019t always apply to every vertical. With Polkadot, not only you do not have to put up a deposit to access a parachain, but nothing stops you from also build state channels on top of parachains. State channels also have limitations in terms of extensibility as a whole where Polkadot does not, since it can theoretically support any state transition logic.Vs \u2018Enterprise Chain\u2019 solutionsBut wait, aren\u2019t all these exciting features going to be part of enterprise chains anyways? After all, EntETH, Hyperledger, Qtum and many, many others have promised both scalability and privacy as part of their consensus at scale mechanisms. Their limitation lies in how they intend to implement these mechanisms. Neither hiding data behind a VPN, nor arbitrarily limiting access to the network by operating private nodes or \u2018permissioned ledgers\u2019 are in my view solutions to scalability and privacy \u2014 they are merely temporary workarounds. Note that there\u2019s nothing wrong in wanting to operate a private chain \u2014 in fact, permissioned solutions are probably today\u2019s implementations of choice in the corporate space \u2014 but Polkadot will provide trust free data exchange between these solutions, extending their reach and functionality rather than competing with them directly.The real advantage on offer here is that it allows for a Fortune 500 company to opt for a particular solution such as Hyperledger while another opts for say, QTUM. By pledging to use Polkadot, both corporate giants can select a solution \u2014 today \u2014 with the confidence their products will eventually be able to talk to each other tomorrow.Vs Ethereum \u20182.x\u2019 and other EVM-based solutionsOne very important point to keep in mind is that Polkadot is not competing against Ethereum, or any EVM-based solutions for that matter. There are, of course, some shared goals with these projects, including the use of PoS technology for example. It\u2019s also very likely we\u2019ll see innovations from one project such as Ethereum Serenity \u2018flow\u2019 to Polkadot and vice versa. Think of Polkadot as a \u201ca blockchain platform\u201d, meaning a platform for developing, experimenting with, deploying and maintaining other blockchains.Vs BaaS-like projectsAh, the controversial BaaS, or Blockchain as a Service (such as Microsoft Azure\u2019s Bletchley Park). Some question why one might want to negate every single advantage of running Blockchain code by deploying it on someone else centralized network, but the reality is that many companies will be happy to use cloud-hosted or BaaS products regardless.It could even be for good reasons \u2014 for example, BaaS might be incontournable if we wish to keep up with the transaction throughput of an AirBnB or Uber, offer simpler key management to end users, or even permit simpler interactions with existing SaaS solutions. To quote Gavin Wood on the matter, \u201cThe critical thing is that optionality be retained \u2014 similarly by Linux being open source, you keep the optionality to audit and understand the codebase; this was instrumental in gaining its adoption in Android and by large enterprises such as IBM.\u201dVs exotic consensus mechanismsThere are dozens of options for consensus mechanism in the wild that transcend traditional blockchain constructs. Let\u2019s take IOTA\u2019s Tangle for example, which offers neither blocks nor chains, but an eventual consistency mechanism instead. It allows for the scaling of simple token value transfer, not smart contracts, and its eventual consistency is applicable to certain scenarios but not all.Factom goes even further and does away completely with the state transition concept altogether. However, the very utility we are after for Dapps results from the output of such a shared state machine. It\u2019s a solution to scalability issues of course, but it doesn\u2019t solve the problems we face as Dapp developers.Compared to these \u2018non-chain\u2019 chains, Polkadot co-secures chains, allowing for some substantial degree of scalability (dozens to hundreds of chains all running in parallel all feeding off the same overarching security mechanisms) \u2014 and it also provides some provision for interaction with existing chains of differing consensus mechanisms such as Ethereum and PoA, plus, by virtue of the EVM meta-protocol layer, a reasonable expectation to be able to integrate more as they come along.Vs off-chain compute servicesProjects such as Truebit or Oraclize.it offer auditable off-chain compute services. Again here we\u2019re looking at cooperation, not competition \u2014 in fact, any solution that works with Ethereum will work with Polkadot, including Golem.As you can probably tell by now, Polkadot is not limited to connecting chains to each other, but can also be used as a relay between arbitrary information providers (including the very interesting Town Crier project) and consensus at scale protocols.Vs SidechainsYou\u2019ve of course heard about 2-way pegs, side-chains and merge-mining before, in fact, by now this stuff sounds borderline prehistoric considering the breakneck-pace at which technologies like Ethereum have evolved in the meantime. Regardless, Polkadot shares the general, loose idea of extensibility of side-chains, but unlike side-chains one its main goals is pooled security across chains, whereas with side-chains you as a developer are expected you to build up a community of miners secure enough to protect the asset you issue.Vs \u2018overlay\u2019 Blockchain ProtocolsSome \u2018overlay\u2019 (or \u2018meta\u2019) blockchain protocols such as melon \u2014 build on existing chains \u2014 share some synergies with Polkadot in that they will be most effective if it is possible for them to trustlessly interact across chains. In that sense, Polkadot as a trust-free cross-chain interconnect would be beneficial to their vision.Vs \u201cRoll your own\u201dIs any of this necessary at all? Couldn\u2019t you just create local adapter on virtual machines and connect chains manually? I\u2019ll include this one because it is often asked. Of course, given the right amount of time, skills and resources, anything is possible to \u2018roll out on your own\u2019, including entire operating systems. That doesn\u2019t make it wise or practical. In the context of Web 3, Polkadot makes it easy to have private chains, experimental blockchains and leverage existing blockchains trustlessly and scalably \u2014 to roll out one\u2019s own version of such framework, keeping up to date with the dozens of options out there and make sure it\u2019s entirely secure is no easy feat, and would require years of development better spent elsewhere (such as building an amazing end-user product!)Another point, Polkadot maintains decentralization throughout whereas \u2018black boxes\u2019 converting from chain A to chain B re-introduce centralization, single points of failure and vendor locking. I can\u2019t really think of an instance where this would be preferable over using a FLOSS project.End of Part 2That was a long post, but I feel it was necessary to set the scene before we dug deeper in the platform. Next post, we\u2019ll go through the Polkadot feature set and its technical aspects: how it actually works, how it relays data back and forth between chains, and we\u2019ll briefly touch on its potential governance mechanisms.Thank you to Peter Czaban, Ryan Zurrer, Gabriel Beeby and David Peyronnin and the whole of the Polkdadot Watercooler Riot Channel for their valuable comments and feedback writing this article.Next blog post should come out in a few weeks.

Through the richness of interactions now possible and the global scope of counter-parties available, Web 3.0 will cryptographically connect data from individuals, corporations and machines, with efficient machine learning algorithms, leading to the rise of fundamentally new markets and associated business models.The future impact of Web 3.0 makes undeniable sense, but the question remains, which business models will crack the code to provide lasting and sustainable value in today\u2019s economy?A history of Business Models across Web 1.0, Web 2.0 and Web 3.0We will dive into native business models that have been and will be enabled by Web 3.0, while first briefly touching upon the quick-forgotten but often arduous journeys leading to the unexpected & unpredictable successful business models that emerged in Web 2.0.To set the scene anecdotally for Web 2.0\u2019s business model discovery process, let us not forget the journey that Google went through from their launch in 1998 to 2002 before going public in 2004:In 1999, while enjoying good traffic, they were clearly struggling with their business model. Their lead investor Mike Moritz (Sequoia Capital) openly stated \u201cwe really couldn\u2019t figure out the business model, there was a period where things were looking pretty bleak\u201d.In 2001, Google was making $85m in revenue while their rival Overture was making $288m in revenue, as CPM based online advertising was falling away post dot-com crash.In 2002, adopting Overture\u2019s ad model, Google went on to launch AdWords Select: its own pay-per-click, auction-based search-advertising product.Two years later, in 2004, Google hits 84.7% of all internet searches and goes public with a valuation of $23.2 billion with annualised revenues of $2.7 billion.After struggling for 4 years, a single small modification to their business model launched Google into orbit to become one of the worlds most valuable companies.Looking back at the wave of Web 2.0 Business ModelsContentThe earliest iterations of online content merely involved the digitisation of existing newspapers and phone books \u2026 and yet, we\u2019ve now seen Roma (Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n) receive 10 Academy Awards Nominations for a movie distributed via the subscription streaming giant Netflix.MarketplacesAmazon started as an online bookstore that nobody believed could become profitable \u2026 and yet, it is now the behemoth of marketplaces covering anything from gardening equipment to healthy food to cloud infrastructure.Open Source SoftwareOpen source software development started off with hobbyists and an idealist view that software should be a freely-accessible common good \u2026 and yet, the entire internet runs on open source software today, creating $400b of economic value a year and Github was acquired by Microsoft for $7.5b while Red Hat makes $3.4b in yearly revenues providing services for Linux.SaaSIn the early days of Web 2.0, it might have been inconceivable that after massively spending on proprietary infrastructure one could deliver business software via a browser and become economically viable \u2026 and yet, today the large majority of B2B businesses run on SaaS models.Sharing EconomyIt was hard to believe that anyone would be willing to climb into a stranger\u2019s car or rent out their couch to travellers \u2026 and yet, Uber and AirBnB have become the largest taxi operator and accommodation providers in the world, without owning any cars or properties.AdvertisingWhile Google and Facebook might have gone into hyper-growth early on, they didn\u2019t have a clear plan for revenue generation for the first half of their existence \u2026 and yet, the advertising model turned out to fit them almost too well, and they now generate 58% of the global digital advertising revenues ($111B in 2018) which has become the dominant business model of Web 2.0.Emerging Web 3.0 Business ModelsTaking a look at Web 3.0 over the past 10 years, initial business models tend not to be repeatable or scalable, or simply try to replicate Web 2.0 models. We are convinced that while there is some scepticism about their viability, the continuous experimentation by some of the smartest builders will lead to incredibly valuable models being built over the coming years.By exploring both the more established and the more experimental Web 3.0 business models, we aim to understand how some of them will accrue value over the coming years.Issuing a native assetHolding the native asset, building the network:Taxation on speculation (exchanges)Payment tokensBurn tokensWork TokensOther modelsIssuing a native asset:Bitcoin came first. Proof of Work coupled with Nakamoto Consensus created the first Byzantine Fault Tolerant & fully open peer to peer network. Its intrinsic business model relies on its native asset: BTC \u2014 a provable scarce digital token paid out to miners as block rewards. Others, including Ethereum, Monero and ZCash, have followed down this path, issuing ETH, XMR and ZEC.These native assets are necessary for the functioning of the network and derive their value from the security they provide: by providing a high enough incentive for honest miners to provide hashing power, the cost for malicious actors to perform an attack grows alongside the price of the native asset, and in turn, the added security drives further demand for the currency, further increasing its price and value. The value accrued in these native assets has been analysed & quantified at length.Holding the native asset, building the network:Some of the earliest companies that formed around crypto networks had a single mission: make their respective networks more successful & valuable. Their resultant business model can be condensed to \u201cincrease their native asset treasury; build the ecosystem\u201d. Blockstream, acting as one of the largest maintainers of Bitcoin Core, relies on creating value from its balance sheet of BTC. Equally, ConsenSys has grown to a thousand employees building critical infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem, with the purpose of increasing the value of the ETH it holds.While this perfectly aligns the companies with the networks, the model is hard to replicate beyond the first handful of companies: amassing a meaningful enough balance of native assets becomes impossible after a while \u2026 and the blood, toil, tears and sweat of launching & sustaining a company cannot be justified without a large enough stake for exponential returns. As an illustration, it wouldn\u2019t be rational for any business other than a central bank \u2014 i.e. a US remittance provider \u2014 to base their business purely on holding large sums of USD while working on making the US economy more successful.Taxing the Speculative Nature of these Native Assets:The subsequent generation of business models focused on building the financial infrastructure for these native assets: exchanges, custodians & derivatives providers. They were all built with a simple business objective \u2014 providing services for users interested in speculating on these volatile assets. While the likes of Coinbase, Bitstamp & Bitmex have grown into billion-dollar companies, they do not have a fully monopolistic nature: they provide convenience & enhance the value of their underlying networks. The open & permissionless nature of the underlying networks makes it impossible for companies to lock in a monopolistic position by virtue of providing \u201cexclusive access\u201d, but their liquidity and brands provide defensible moats over time.Payment Tokens:With The Rise of the Token Sale, a new wave of projects in the blockchain space based their business models on payment tokens within networks: often creating two sided marketplaces, and enforcing the use of a native token for any payments made. The assumptions are that as the network\u2019s economy would grow, the demand for the limited native payment token would increase, which would lead to an increase in value of the token. While the value accrual of such a token model is debated, the increased friction for the user is clear \u2014 what could have been paid in ETH or DAI, now requires additional exchanges on both sides of a transaction. While this model was widely used during the 2017 token mania, its friction-inducing characteristics have rapidly removed it from the forefront of development over the past 9 months.Burn Tokens:Revenue generating communities, companies and projects with a token might not always be able to pass the profits on to the token holders in a direct manner. A model that garnered a lot of interest as one of the characteristics of the Binance (BNB) and MakerDAO (MKR) tokens was the idea of buybacks / token burns. As revenues flow into the project (from trading fees for Binance and from stability fees for MakerDAO), native tokens are bought back from the public market and burned, resulting in a decrease of the supply of tokens, which should lead to an increase in price. It\u2019s worth exploring Arjun Balaji\u2019s evaluation (The Block), in which he argues the Binance token burning mechanism doesn\u2019t actually result in the equivalent of an equity buyback: as there are no dividends paid out at all, the \u201cearning per token\u201d remains at $0.Work Tokens:One of the business models for crypto-networks that we are seeing \u2018hold water\u2019 is the work token: a model that focuses exclusively on the revenue generating supply side of a network in order to reduce friction for users. Some good examples include Augur\u2019s REP and Keep Network\u2019s KEEP tokens. A work token model operates similarly to classic taxi medallions, as it requires service providers to stake / bond a certain amount of native tokens in exchange for the right to provide profitable work to the network. One of the most powerful aspects of the work token model is the ability to incentivise actors with both carrot (rewards for the work) & stick (stake that can be slashed). Beyond providing security to the network by incentivising the service providers to execute honest work (as they have locked skin in the game denominated in the work token), they can also be evaluated by predictable future cash-flows to the collective of service providers (we have previously explored the benefits and valuation methods for such tokens in this blog). In brief, such tokens should be valued based of the future expected cash flows attributable to all the service providers in the network, which can be modelled out based on assumptions on pricing and usage of the network.A wide array of other models are being explored and worth touching upon:Dual token model such as MKR/DAI & SPANK/BOOTY where one asset absorbs the volatile up- & down-side of usage and the other asset is kept stable for optimal transacting.Governance tokens which provide the ability to influence parameters such as fees and development prioritisation and can be valued from the perspective of an insurance against a fork.Tokenised securities as digital representations of existing assets (shares, commodities, invoices or real estate) which are valued based on the underlying asset with a potential premium for divisibility & borderless liquidity.Transaction fees for features such as the models BloXroute & Aztec Protocol have been exploring with a treasury that takes a small transaction fee in exchange for its enhancements (e.g. scalability & privacy respectively).Tech 4 Tokens as proposed by the Starkware team who wish to provide their technology as an investment in exchange for tokens \u2014 effectively building a treasury of all the projects they work with.Providing UX/UI for protocols, such as Veil & Guesser are doing for Augur and Balance is doing for the MakerDAO ecosystem, relying on small fees or referrals & commissions.Network specific services which currently include staking providers (e.g. Staked.us), CDP managers (e.g. topping off MakerDAO CDPs before they become undercollateralised) or marketplace management services such as OB1 on OpenBazaar which can charge traditional fees (subscription or as a % of revenues)Liquidity providers operating in applications that don\u2019t have revenue generating business models. For example, Uniswap is an automated market maker, in which the only route to generating revenues is providing liquidity pairs.With this wealth of new business models arising and being explored, it becomes clear that while there is still room for traditional venture capital, the role of the investor and of capital itself is evolving. The capital itself morphs into a native asset within the network which has a specific role to fulfil. From passive network participation to bootstrap networks post financial investment (e.g. computational work or liquidity provision) to direct injections of subjective work into the networks (e.g. governance or CDP risk evaluation), investors will have to reposition themselves for this new organisational mode driven by trust minimised decentralised networks.When looking back, we realise Web 1.0 & Web 2.0 took exhaustive experimentation to find the appropriate business models, which have created the tech titans of today. We are not ignoring the fact that Web 3.0 will have to go on an equally arduous journey of iterations, but once we find adequate business models, they will be incredibly powerful: in trust minimised settings, both individuals and enterprises will be enabled to interact on a whole new scale without relying on rent-seeking intermediaries.Today we see 1000s of incredibly talented teams pushing forward implementations of some of these models or discovering completely new viable business models. As the models might not fit the traditional frameworks, investors might have to adapt by taking on new roles and provide work and capital (a journey we have already started at Fabric Ventures), but as long as we can see predictable and rational value accrual, it makes sense to double down, as every day the execution risk is getting smaller and smaller.With thanks to Andy Bromberg & David Fauchier for the insightful comments and feedback on this piece.Disclosure: Fabric Ventures and individuals involved in writing this content have direct or indirect exposure to Keep, Orchid, MakerDAO, Staked, Ethereum & Bitcoin.", "responses": 5, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Token", "Crypto", "Venture Capital", "Web3"]}, {"title": "Gwei or die: Is eradicating user gas costs a dangerous move for Web3?", "post_link": "https://medium.com/streamrblog/ending-network-gas-costs-bad-for-web3-decentralization-7ef9ce036f09?source=search_post", "author_name": "Shiv Malik", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@shiv.malik", "publish_date": "2018-12-13", "last_modified_date": "2019-01-24", "readtime": "6.47", "claps": 1186, "voters": 105, "content": "Gwei or die: Is eradicating user gas costs a dangerous move for Web3?Shiv MalikFollowDec 13, 2018 \u00b7 7 min readWeb3 Summit: Lots of Buidlers but not enough users. Is getting rid of gas costs the right way forward?During my time as a Guardian journalist, the then Readers\u2019 Editor, Chris Elliott, told me a story. Not long after launching the paper\u2019s website, in 1999, the office began receiving cheques. Loyal readers wanted to offer payment for what they\u2019d read online, as they were doing with print just a few weeks before. The only issue was that these digital readers didn\u2019t know where to send the cash.It was an awkward moment. The pioneers of Web1.0 had told management that if they wanted to reach a mass online audience, content would have to be free. Internet users wouldn\u2019t put up with the friction of online payments. If the Guardian wanted to monetise their efforts, they should look to advertisers, not readers, for funding. So the Guardian ended up sending the cheques back.We now know how that \u201cfree content\u201d strategy panned out for the media as a whole; dwindling income, monopolisation of advertising revenues by Facebook and Google, sacked journalists, reams of clickbait articles, attention grabbing fake news and the subversion of democracy. In the search for rapidly onboarding users, sustainable business models and incentives had failed to be designed properly and in the end the product, and the industry producing it, had ultimately been undermined.I was reminded of this story whilst listening to internet pioneer Brewster Kahle at DevCon4 when he asked, \u201cHow do we get beyond the original sin of the web: advertising?\u201dThe answer is of course much more realisable than it ever has been. Reader micropayment systems such as those being implemented by Brave, are finally offering media companies a real chance to readjust the interests at play between advertisers and readers. This is the promise of Web3.And yet just as the media might be fixing a disastrous strategic error, the community of people tasked with creating the fix \u2014 dApp makers and Web3 UX designers \u2014 might be making the very same error themselves.During DevCon4 the one thing that caught my ear, were the fairly recurrent conversations about whether to abandon gas costs to help dApps increase their user base.When it comes to onboarding users, we can all agree, gas payments are a UX nightmare. Which designer would want users to face a lifetime of permissioning another window in Metamask and figuring out what the hell a gwei is, let alone how much gwei they need to result in an outcome that may (or may not) take place? Although these payments are vital to keep a number of decentralized networks going, they don\u2019t really add anything positive to the user experience. They\u2019re a necessary but very inconvenient hassle. Rather like road tolls. And the last thing crypto needs right now is more road tolls.Ridding users of the hassle of gas costs is already happening. Peepeth, Crypto\u2019s version of Twitter, has already enacted such a change. It was something Peepth\u2019s Andrew B Coathup scoped out back in May. And according to Peepeth\u2019s founder, they may go further with this.Similarly worried about user onboarding, the ever brilliant Austin Thomas Griffith created a burner wallet to demonstrate gas-less wallet creation.And yet, however much trying to eliminate gas as a part of Web3 interactions seems like a good idea, it strikes me (and I\u2019m not a UX designer, just a crypto enthusiast approaching these problems from the economics side of things) killing gas payments for end users is a possibly disastrous move. If someone has to pay for gas costs on a decentralized network, and that someone isn\u2019t the people using the service, then who will pay?To start with, dApp buidlers might want to pony up for gas costs. At the launch of a product, these costs are likely to be a fairly insignificant in a project\u2019s overall budget. But if dApp user numbers do take off, then projects paying for gas out of their own funds (especially if this means paying for Ethereum gas costs) won\u2019t be sustainable for very long.The real horror is that advertisers step into the gap \u2014 paying gas as a way of harvesting user attention and maintaining their Web2 business model for the Web3 era. And if it isn\u2019t advertisers, then there are any number of other ways that a given network\u2019s user base could be controlled through third parties offering to pay for user gas costs.So if users aren\u2019t habituated to paying for gas now, or the space finds sustainable gas free solutions that keep users firmly in control, then unwinding \u201clook, no gas!\u201d dApp designs five or ten years from now, may well prove impossible when interests and behaviors become entrenched. Like print media, we\u2019ll all be rueing the day we made gas \u201cfree\u201d.So do we just persist with gas payments even though this might mean turning a good number of people off dApps altogether? Making this choice wouldn\u2019t be too dissimilar to the UX decisions the space has made in regards to user security and privacy. Also at DevCon4, Taylor Monahan detailed MyCrypto\u2019s brave decision to stop people entering their private keys directly on to the site in order to ensure user security even though doing that meant user numbers falling off a cliff.But you stand by your principles right? Speaking to Laura Shin at the Oslo Freedom forum earlier this year Amber Baldet, founder and CEO of Clovyr, put it this way :Historically there is generally a trade-off between security and privacy and convenience and \u2026 a sentiment that runs through the communities of people who care is that other people should just care enough to get over it [the inconvenience]. And if they understood the world the way that we do, then they would see the value in clicking this extra button or understanding these different settings.So if we\u2019ve created plenty of Web3 frictions in the name of privacy and security, why not create a few more to stop networks being captured by third party interests?The inconvenience of gas costs could even be sold as a genuine plus point. Ethical consumerism is sorely lacking in the digital sphere and given that Web3 is already running on that pitch, gas could be marketed as the stand out feature which demonstrates how dApps really are different from apps. Paying gas sets you free.If that strategy isn\u2019t very persuasive, there might be another way forward. Instead of getting third parties to pay to make experiences more convenient for users, why not instead pay users to be inconvenienced?Here\u2019s an example.Kickback, is crypto\u2019s version of Eventbrite. To attend an event, you register with your Ethereum ID and reserve your place by sending a deposit in ETH (oh and paying the required Ethereum Network gas costs to process the transaction for said deposit).Yes, there are a number of steps to get registered but assuming you have already installed Metamask, and have some ETH at your disposal, then despite the gas costs, there are fewer steps involved than buying a ticket through Eventbrite.But this is where using Kickback comes into its own, setting it apart from Web2 solutions. At the end of the event, any registered event goers who didn\u2019t turn up, lose their deposit and this pool of money is then returned to all attendees as a \u2026 kickback (gedit!). You have the chance to earn for attending an event and however small the amount, it\u2019s a great feeling when you receive that extra nugget of ETH.It worked! Streamr, Golem and Omise Go\u2019s packed Cryptoween party due to KickbackLike most of Silicon Valley\u2019s giants, Kickback is capturing value generated by its users\u2019 activities. But instead of keeping those proceeds for themselves, Kickback employs one of blockchain\u2019s USPs \u2014 easily distributing value in a one-to-many pattern \u2014 to pass those proceeds back to its community of users.You can imagine this mechanism working for many other types of dApps like say a social messaging platform. Users in that community could permission the data they generate to be sold, and in turn those users would receive the proceeds of the sale of that communally generated data.(Disclosure: this is something that we\u2019re working on at Streamr and we\u2019ll be previewing in Q2 of 2019). Or the gaming industry, where revenues generated for in-app purchases could be re-distributed to the broader community.In a way, inconveniencing users with such things as gas costs and other infrastructure expenses, which maintain a community\u2019s digital independence, could really help support the same systems that properly remunerate users for their activities. To put it another way, gas costs are the price communities pay to build themselves prosperous digital co-operatives.The Ethereum space has always attracted those interested in building tools for human coordination (h/t WD). But attracting a new generation of users to Web3 means changing the terms of business. No one wants clunky design and user experiences with seemingly unnecessary friction. But if Web2\u2019s great gambit was to take people\u2019s independence, security and money in exchange for convenience, then maybe Web3 can offer to reverse that flow and give people independence, security and money in return for (a little bit) of inconvenience.", "responses": 8, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Ethereum", "Decentralization", "Web3", "UX"]}, {"title": "ScalingNOW! \u2014 Scaling Solution Summit Summary", "post_link": "https://medium.com/web3foundation/scalingnow-scaling-solution-summit-summary-be30047047bf?source=search_post", "author_name": "Web3 Foundation Team", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@web3", "publish_date": "2018-03-26", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-13", "readtime": "12.3", "claps": 959, "voters": 87, "content": "ScalingNOW! \u2014 Scaling Solution Summit SummaryWeb3 Foundation TeamFollowMar 26, 2018 \u00b7 13 min readThe two-day ScalingNOW! workshop in Barcelona brought many teams together from across the blockchain space and from around the globe to share their ideas on scaling solutions. Once the teams touched down on Sunday night, the discussions began over the welcome dinner and it was clear that everyone was excited to get cracking.In addition to this blog post we have created a detailed spreadsheet of the scaling solutions that presented at the workshop:Scaling Solution Summary SpreadsheetIn this post, we will recap our findings from the first day of the event. We will briefly cover the purpose of the event, what scalability means, the leading solutions to scalability in the near term and some of our thoughts on the current state of the solutions.The ObjectivePre-conference multi-team dinner!We believe that in the current ecosystem \u201cscalability is still the key obstacle facing blockchain\u201d. Teams around the world are building scaling solutions, but until now they have been working in moderate isolation without much cross-team collaboration.The ScalingNOW! event was also an opportunity for those teams working on scaling solutions to meet each other as well as meeting the DApp developers (on day 2) affected by high fees. To be invited, teams needed to be working on a scaling a solution meant for deployment either now or in the next few months.This topic is extremely significant for the Web3 Foundation because both long and short term scaling solutions are necessary in order for the Foundation\u2019s vision to materialise.In the short term we can solve some of the scalability issues with a Proof of Authority (POA) side chain which can be linked to Ethereum via a bridge. Parity Technologies presented Parity Bridge and discussed how it can utilise low-cost POA networks to mitigate high fees. While this helps in the short term, the bridge is also one of the core elements of Polkadot (a longer term scaling solution stewarded by the Web3 Foundation).What is scalability?In the context of Ethereum, we define scalability as the capacity of the main network to improve performance (throughput, latency) as the number of users (DApps) increases, without making a difference to the users\u2019 experience (gas prices, transaction times). The network architecture must be able to adapt to new demands as adoption increases, not the other way around.We saw the scaling issue most clearly when CryptoKitties hit peak activity. Transactions on Ethereum quickly became very expensive and the network slowed down.Dieter Shirley, a developer from CryptoKitties stated that \u201c70% of gas is being consumed on smart contracts and we aren\u2019t optimised for that. Also, the model of storing everything forever just doesn\u2019t scale.\u201dMain Solutions \u2014 State Channels and SidechainsThe two main solutions that are ready for use today are state channels and sidechains. These solutions move some of the transaction logic off-chain, but ultimately rely on the main chain for final settlement.There was also an alternative solution presented by the TrueBit team (more details are given later in this piece).State Channels provide a direct one-to-one interaction between two addresses (for example, two users). The bulk of the computation involved in the interactions between users are calculated and communicated off-chain in a cryptographically secure fashion; however, the final settlement of balances occur on the mainnet Ethereum chain.Attendee projects: \u00b5Raiden, Counterfactual, FunFair, SpankChain, Decentraland.Sidechains, also known as bridged chains or parachains, are chains that run in parallel to the main Ethereum chain. These chains will have their own consensus mechanism which does not have to be the same type of mechanism as deployed on Ethereum. For example, it is possible to have a Proof-of-Authority (PoA) or a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) sidechain. These chains are not fully independent but ultimately rely upon Ethereum for final settlement. However, they do provide for multiple users to temporarily interact with each other off-chain.Attendee projects: Parity Technologies, POA Network, Cosmos, Plasma.TimelineIn order to help guide DApp developers we are providing the following timeline to show which scaling solutions are ready \u201cNOW!\u201d and which solutions will be ready in the near future.NOW!\u00b5Raiden \u2014 ERC20 & 223 State Channel.Decentraland \u2014 Custom / Purpose-built State Channel.Parity Tech \u2014 Sidechain Bridge.POA Network \u2014 Sidechain solution.< 4 monthsFunFair \u2014 Generalised State Channel.< 6 monthsCosmos \u2014 Sidechain solution (interoperating blockchains).~ 6 monthsCounterfactual \u2014 Generalised State Channel.TrueBit \u2014 Off-chain solution for computationally-heavy DApps.< 9 monthsPlasma \u2014 Hierarchical Sidechain solution..Project Summaries \u2014 State Channel SolutionsIn this section we will summarise the key points regarding the state channel scaling solutions presented by those who visited Barcelona.\u00b5RaidenWhat: A state channel exclusively for tokens (only the ERC20 and ERC223 standards). If you want to use your own tokens you need to deploy your own contract.When: Ready!Security: Relies on the main chain to be secure, live, and useable. It is not possible to open more chains than main chain can handle. At the moment \u00b5Raiden doesn\u2019t yet understand and obey whitelists or blacklists: this a problem when the channel closes.In addition, users must keep private keys safeUseability: A payment receiver has to run a light client or a full node as they need to check the transaction. The sender doesn\u2019t need to do so since they are the ones who open the channel and knows its state. There is a gas cost of 100k to open the channel, but apparently less to close it.CounterfactualWhat: Looking into creating a generalised state channel beyond payments: the team suggested that their channels could be used for playing chess (with smart contract to mediate) or more generally as a means exchanging of information.When: in 6 months.Security: Instant finality from the perspective of the state channel: i.e. the settlement of payment is instant, but only if the other party is available. This assumes the underlying chain is also live and secure. The only acknowledged attack on the state channel is if someone reports an out-of-date (old state) and then refuses to respond. If counterparty is cost minimising they can slow down transaction (DOS), which costs, but this doesn\u2019t allow for stolen funds.Useability: Aiming to provide an API so developers don\u2019t need to know exactly how their code works in order to use it. The use of state channels is suggested to provide response times seen with web applications; however, the team was keen point out that not all problems can be put into a channel (\u201cnot channeliseable\u201d).FunFairWhat: Building a casino app which is directly P2P via a one-on-one state channel: i.e. a gambler vs a casino. FunFair are creating the app but will not act as the casino. Their state channel works in the following way:open channel,lock funds,play game,close channel and release funds (settle balances).FunFair said that their state channel is general and not just limited to payment transfers, but it has an off-chain state machine. They also stated that they developed a solution to create a shared random no scheme alongside state channel: this is to enable provable fairness.When: Have launched an minimum viable product already, but expect more in 4 months. Code will eventually be published.Security: Lots of different things can go wrong. The games are web applications which can be vulnerable to the usual web security problems (this is off-chain); however, all transactions are signed as with regular Ethereum transactions, but users must manage own private keys.Useability: Opening a channel takes 15\u201320 seconds. The number of transactions is not capped by the FunFair state machine but by how many open connections Ethereum can handle.SpankChainWhat: Still at the early stages of thinking and planning out what their state channel solution will look like. Want to create a generalised state channel that does more than just payment.When: No indication yet. Only just put an idea together about a month ago.Security: No indication yet.Useability: No indication yet.DecentralandWhat: The project is a virtual world where parcels of land have been sold. The auction already happened (December 2017) and was all off-chain.When: Happened (December 2017, custom solution). New use-cases and solutions possible but no date indicated for completion.Security: The auction had a trusted set up, but was fully verifiable. Some users ran scripts (off-chain) to validate that the state transitions were fully valid.Useability: The solution was custom built for the Decentraland auction which means that a lot of work could be involved to adapt it to another project. It should be noted that the state transitions had to be completely serialisable which limits throughput: 10s-100s requests per second, and theoretical it could handle 1000s if is limited commitment failures.General problems with state channelsVulnerable to denial of service attacksEthereum must be deposited and locked-up while channel is in useThere is a challenge for application developers to change the way they design apps: they need to build with state channels in mind.There is a dependency on multi-signature contracts. We\u2019ve seen a range of attacks against these in the last year which highlights a potential risk if relied upon heavily. Hopefully, these become more robust over time.Existing tools need to start integrating state channel functionality. Currently, limited progress has been made here.Lack of a general timestamping service.Not all applications are \u201cchanneliseable\u201d.State channels work in applications where you know the other parties in advance, although this isn\u2019t strictly necessary it does invoke a certain amount of trust before creating the channel.Project Summaries \u2014 Sidechain SolutionsWeb3 Foundation Executive Director Peter Czaban presents to ScalingNOW!In this section we will summarise the key points of the solutions who visited Barcelona and are working on a sidechain solution to scaling.Parity TechnologiesWhat: The team have created a bridge contract that can connect a POA network and the main Ethereum blockchain. The current test bridge allows transfers of ERC20 tokens, but the team are working on a generalised bridge that allows for arbitrary message passing. This is a test of the technology which be used to connect chains together Polkadot, naturally the Web3 Foundation is supportive of this technologyWhen: ERC20 test bridge is ready. A general bridge with arbitrary message passing is expected to be 2 months away.Security: If a majority of authorities is compromised then the bridge is compromised. This solution currently requires trust that a majority of authorities doesn\u2019t collude. Authorities have their reputation at stake.Useability: Can deploy a dapp on the test net and then use exact same dapp on the mainnet. The code is the same.Cross-chain transaction speeds are limited by the slowest chain; while the sidechain can be faster than the Ethereum mainnet, this solution doesn\u2019t allow for the same throughput rates as state channels. Message passing in both directions should be less than 100000 gas each direction.POA NetworkWhat: The team have created a Proof-of-Authority (POA) Network which is a public Ethereum sidechain that uses a POA consensus mechanism with independent validators. It relies upon the Parity Bridge.The POA Network team are also working on an open source block explorer which is a valuable resource for the community.The team have also created a deployment playbook for people to spin up a POA network quickly. This allows for a horizontal scaling using parity bridges.When: Now! Deployment tools also exist.Security: The considerations are similar to those of Parity (previous solution). There is a dynamic list of validators that vote to add / remove each other. Need to compromise 51% to compromise finality.Useability: Writing a DApp for the POA network is the same for Ethereum: they are just solidity contracts (No new SDKs). There are some new security design considerations plus there is some set up involved, but the team have created playbooks to help developers get up and running.Block times are about 5 seconds (which allows for 3x throughput compared to Ethereum).CosmosWhat: The Cosmos team are working on 3 different areas to improve scaling: (1) consensus algorithm, (2) state machine, (3) multiple interoperating chains.1. Tendermint \u2014 is an asynchronous POS algorithm which provides Byzantine Fault Tolerance. It is suggested to be faster than synchronous POS without suffering other security issues.2. A new state machine being developed by the team which is not Turing complete, but will allow for application-specific blockchains.3. As there is a limit for a single blockchain there is a clear need a multi blockchain solution which allows for intercommunication.When: (1) Tendermint core exists, (2) Cosmos SDK 99% done, (3) about 70% done so probably another 3\u20134 months away.Security: Cosmos will offer 3 different types of chains: (1) sovereign, (2) hosted, and (3) hybrid (similar to Plasma).Sovereign blockchains are fully independent and have their own validators (to find consensus), but can be bridged.Hosted don\u2019t have their own consensus mechanism.Hybrid chains have their own validators, but absorb some security properties form the Cosmos hub (a set of 100 validators).There is finality in 1 block using tendermint; however, there can be liveness issues, if more than a third of validators go offline. In that case the network halts (fail safe).Useability: The Cosmos team believe that Tendermint scales well. The Ethereum specific version of their algorithm (Ethermint) can do 200/300 txs per second and they hope their Cosmos SDK will improve that. If Geth does 200/300, It was guess that Parity can do 500. Not 1000s per second. The Hub has 1\u20133 second block times. It possible to have interoperability between Cosmos and Ethereum.PlasmaWhat: Hierarchical sidechains on Ethereum. The aim is to move a lot of smart contract computation onto sidechains rather than being performed on the main chain.When: Soon. For simple apps it could be done in a few months.Security: In simplest form: child chain with own consensus mechanism (POS). If that fails then fail back to root chain to settle. It\u2019s the responsibility of everyone holding value on side chain to notice if something goes wrong, and to exit. There could be congestion if everyone tried to exit at the same time, and doubly bad if there was a busy ICO happening at the same time. Ultimate finality is on the main chain.Useability: Users will need to deposit and withdraw funds. The team expect transaction through to be an order of magnitude higher (10x) than is present with Ethereum.General problems with sidechainsIn a POA network you need to explicitly trust the authorities.Tooling can be an issue, although at least one team (POA Network) is working on an open source block explorer.Can\u2019t offer transfers as quickly as state channels do (although allow for many-to-many transactions).Dependent on the root chain for complete settlement.Project Summaries \u2014 Alternative solutionsTrueBitWhat: Allows for computation to be offloaded to an off-chain virtual machine, but there is a smart contract on-chain. Tasks are created through the TrueBit contract, but clients pick them off and run them. There are three layers in the TrueBit solution.Computational layer (bottom): WASM VM running off and on chain. There is an expectation that this will be able to work with Polkadot.Dispute resolution (verification game).Incentives (top): determines how much original task paid, how solver and challenger selected.When:Bottom: Computation layer: 6 months.Middle: Verification game. 6 months.Top: Incentive layer. Never? It evolves.Security: Just need a single honest verifier: as long as one person checks work of solver they\u2019ll prove the incorrectness. It is possible to delay execution of task by challenging it at the cost of a deposit (submit bogus challenges, at every turn you lose your deposit). Note that dispute resolution is done via Ethereum. There could be an availability issue as data is on IFPS which must be live with the published data also being live.Useability: Any application on ethereum can use TrueBit, ideal for those applications which can\u2019t fit into gas limit. The cost of running an application on TrueBit = TrueBit gas cost * number of the steps to run on TrueBit.The ether gas cost: verification game is log(n); N is the no of steps in computation.Log(n): This assumes a binary search and take the midpoint.For some simple computations using Ethereum is faster, but past the crossover point it is faster to offload the computation to TrueBit.State channels can be implemented in the future which would help to speed up the verification game process.The team have a desire to all the task giver to have as easy a time as possible and to let them pay using any token. This is a problem which can be solved by decentralised exchange.We wish to extend our thanks to the @Giveth team for helping to co-organise this event with us @Web3Foundation.

And as I return from the inaugural Web3 Summit in Berlin \u2014 a gathering of projects and innovators who are all working on driving forwards this new concept of Web3 \u2014 it seems more relevant than ever before.The message is clear. Whilst we face the greatest opportunity that civilisation has ever seen to build technology to power a new world that is based on the foundations of improved global collaboration, the stakes are higher than they\u2019ve ever been. And the promise of breaking new ground is only exceeded by the risks of failure if we get it wrong.With the SAFE Network, we\u2019re building a vision of this new decentralised, inclusive future that is, I would argue, more extensive than most. But there remains a significant overlap in vision with many of the projects in attendance. The devil, as ever, is in the detail.Centralisation: Distribution of MessagesThe venue itself was stunning, located as it was within the old DDR building in Berlin from which propaganda was spread across the radio. This symbol of the old world\u2019s dependence on centralised, controlled and restricted communications acted as the perfect foil for the thousands of individual conversations that took place during the three days about the future of the world that we\u2019d like to live in.Web3: A RecapWeb3 Summit, Berlin, 2018At its core, Web3 is all about control \u2014 but by the individual as opposed to centralised authorities. The focus is on ownership of personal data (in its many guises) combined with architectural resilience in the face of entrenched traditional powers. In days gone by, monolithic state infrastructures would have played those roles in isolation. Today, however, that definition of power has been extended to include our new technocratic overlords, in the form of GAFAM etc.But tomorrow? That is where we have a choice.With the promise of that data ownership will come new opportunities \u2014 for individuals to choose if and when to share and even if they\u2019d like to monetise their data moving forwards. And an opportunity to end to the broken commercial model that drives the internet today \u2014 the advertising that drives a pay-per-click model and clickbait, with platforms pushing the content that angers you, as they seek to engage you for longer on each page that is paid for by a company that requires eyeballs to serve up to advertisers.To recap, Web 1.0 was all about placing static content online. Web 2.0 (a term coined by O\u2019Reilly Media in 2004) gave us a revolution in the form of the read-write-publish web \u2014 an opportunity to interact with content online by taking part in social conversations, wiki\u2019s, blog publishing and community building. A huge step forwards but with one vital flaw. As more and more data and information flooded online, the shadow of platform risk hung over society\u2019s activities \u2014 the chance that any third party could decide to remove your content at will.Remember Geocities? If you grew up on the Net in the 90\u2019s, you\u2019re likely to remember the collection of user-generated webpages \u2014 and how it disappeared when Yahoo shut it down. The future can\u2019t be one in which human endeavour and creativity is simply lost to the world if it doesn\u2019t dovetail nicely with a specific commercial model (although thanks to the Internet Archive, many of these were preserved).So Web3 should ensure that this data will be distributed and no longer reliant on single insecure central parties. I\u2019m in two minds about the term Web3 myself. The community needs a rallying phrase to assemble around, I\u2019d agree. But I think there\u2019s a risk that it focuses attention on the front end, the user experience of this new paradigm \u2014 whilst underplaying the significance of the changes that are taking place under the hood. Because a significant part of this new world doesn\u2019t simply come down to where the data is stored. Today, we can also now move forwards on the basis of a new trust that the data we receive has not been falsified, a reassurance that doesn\u2019t rely on the intentions of those traditional third parties.Web3: The Challenges AheadClearly, technical challenges still exist. Some believe that the answers lie in blockchain technology. Others, like MaidSafe, believe that different structures are required if we are to build a next generation web. But either way, it\u2019s clear that there is much more that needs to be worked on than \u2018simply\u2019 breaking new ground in computer science.Take governance, for example. How are decisions made in a decentralised system? Who can take part and how do you deal with those who disagree? After all, what one side finds desirable is, by definition, disliked by everyone else. The topic is inherently political \u2014 as shown by one panel session at the conference which started with the organisers handing out popcorn to everyone in the packed room in anticipation of the sparks that would fly\u2026A Sense of HistoryBut what I really liked about the Summit was the fact that much of the techno-utopian hype was tempered by the insightful comments from those with broader experience of where we\u2019ve been.The internet was built for connectivity \u2014 not for security. However, the Web today fails in achieving even that basic aim. Because Web3 is not a new term. It was previously used to describe the Semantic Web \u2014 the dream of connecting data between the platform silos that was originally championed by Sir Tim Berners-Lee amongst others. And on today\u2019s web, data portability is little more than a dream.And whilst there is an overlap between the two communities (crypto to web standards), it\u2019s not a perfect fit and those are many conversations that need to take place between the groups. It\u2019s a key reason why we at MaidSafe are working to build ensure that TBL\u2019s SOLID project is compatible with the SAFE Network, for example.Because the reality is that the first attempt to decentralise the web failed. Partly due to technological constraints admittedly. But that doesn\u2019t tell the full story.History shows that a focus on technology alone is rarely enough. Caused in part by the short-sightedness adoption of the techno-centric \u2018field of dreams\u2019 approach (i.e. build it and they will come), led many to simply assume that adoption would be guaranteed if you simply build the best technology. It wasn\u2019t. Instead the atmosphere of the Internet community changed radically with the vast influx of capital into the technology sector. And as technologists insisted on championing their own competing standards and bodies, the only ones that ultimately benefited from the chaos were the large Internet startups who managed to solve the only question that mattered in Web2.0 \u2014 how to turn data into money.So we watched as technical breakthroughs were commandeered and ultimately powered Google\u2019s sign-in process and Facebook\u2019s Social Graph, for example. So moving forwards, it\u2019s naive to assume that there will not be attempts to capture and influence the future direction that any technology takes.And so it remains today. Even within the decentralised Web3 community, the risks of corporate capture loom large.A key message here is that ultimately all new technology mirrors the attitudes of its creators. For good. Or bad.The Way ForwardAs Sir Tim Berners-Lee has pointed out, what makes the web important is not that the fact that web pages exist \u2014 but that each of those web pages represents a real human at the other end who is creating value for others around the world. This time we need to lock the web open. The Web3 Summit was tangible evidence of the huge enthusiasm for the opportunity that faces us all to advance human civilisation in a way that has never before existed. But as important as cryptocurrency has proven in the incentivisation of disparate interests around the world, a sobering reminder comes from engineer and inventor Douglas Engelbart, who once wrote: the Internet isn\u2019t about making money; it\u2019s about augmenting our intelligence.It\u2019s a vision that benefits everyone. But it\u2019s important that everyone \u2014 and not just a bunch of predominantly Western developers in their early twenties \u2014 gets involved. The stakes are far too high. Because this isn\u2019t just about making improvements.Today, we stand at a fork in the road. One path leads off to the creation of what many believe will be a fairer, more just, decentralised society. Yet if we choose to do nothing, instead continuing along the current path \u2014 or perhaps we simply fail to coordinate our efforts in collaborative way \u2014 the road we travel may very well lead only to a dystopian surveillance society with little personal freedom. A world in which we ultimately become powerless to do anything as our data is consumed by the insatiable appetite of machine-learning and AI algorithms, as they relentlessly build and optimise the tools of the state.Today is not a time for idealism. Realism and collaboration must win the day. But only if we find a way to overcome our differences and self-interest.The software is open source. The community is growing. And the door is open. But not forever. It\u2019s up to us \u2014 every one of us \u2014 to roll up our sleeves and get involved.

This post marks the start of a new series of blog posts \u201cIntroducing\u201d never before seen technology discovered by the talented Mercury team.The iOS team here at Mercury Protocol is very happy to announce that we have open sourced the framework web3.swift. Mercury\u2019s web3.swift provides native iOS developers an API to encode and sign transactions client side. This gives clients the choice to send to the blockchain directly or send it elsewhere to avoid mobile devices acting as Ethereum peers.Mercury\u2019s web3.swift library gives the blockchain community and app developers an easier way to use Swift for Ethereum: Account Management, Transaction Encoding, and Signing.This library is similar to web3.js for Web and web3j for Java and Android.PrerequisitesHomebrewCocoaPods 1.4.0 or aboveXCode 9 or aboveInstall CocoaPods using Homebrew by entering the following in a terminal:$ brew install CocoaPodsLibrary InstallationFirst, create an Xcode iOS app project called Web3SwiftExample in your home directory. To integrate web3.swift into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, first create a podfile.$ cd ~/Web3SwiftExample$ pod initOpen the newly created Podfile with a text editor, and paste in the following in the pods section:pod 'web3swift', :git => 'https://github.com/MercuryProtocol/web3.swift.git', :branch => 'master'Your podfile should look like this:# Uncomment the next line to define a global platform for your project# platform :ios, '9.0'target 'Web3SwiftExample' do# Comment the next line if you're not using Swift and don't want to use dynamic frameworksuse_frameworks!# Pods for Web3SwiftExamplepod 'web3swift', :git => 'https://github.com/MercuryProtocol/web3.swift.git', :branch => 'master'endThen, run the following command:$ pod update$ pod installOpen the newly created .xcworkspacefileDisclaimer: This is a work in progress, which doesn\u2019t support full features of web3 or geth. In the coming months, we will add more to the library and open-source more of the code.Problems and SolutionsWhy use Geth?Time was critical and we had to build solution to showcase integration of Mercury Protocol in Dust. This saved a lot of time without having to write a lot of code from the ground up. Also, it is the official library hence new changes and patches can be immediately integrated in Dust as soon as they are released instead of relying on third party vendors.Why not connect to blockchain directly from iOS?We wanted to keep iOS and Android clients as light as possible. Hence, we created a Mercury server which is responsible for business logic instead of writing everything \u201con the client side.\u201dHow to support Int256 on iOS?Out of the box Swift doesn\u2019t support Int256. This is big problem if you want to represent values in wei. We had two options either use GethBigInt provided by Geth or use the BigInt Swift framework. We chose to use GethBigInt and wrote Swift Extensions to add additional functionalities. We might end up using BigInt in the future if we do decide to move away from using Geth.How to fix issues with the debugger?The simulator debugger might crash which can be fixed by removing arm7 from supporting architectures. You can find more information about this here.How to use web3.swift?We have created an example application showcasing how to use this framework here. This simple application generates default accounts and shows how to sign transactions. But let\u2019s go through a few examples here to showcase how to use web3.swift in iOS.Example: Create an Ethereum Account1. Import librariesNote: If you have compilation issues see \u201cFixing compiler issues\u201d belowimport web3swiftimport Geth2. Choose your namespace and passwordlet configA = EthAccountConfiguration(namespace: \"walletA\", password: \"qwerty\")3. Call launch with configuration to create a keystore and accountlet (keystoreA, accountA): (GethKeyStore?,GethAccount?) = EthAccountCoordinator.default.launch(configA)keystoreA : The encrypted private and public key for wallet AaccountA : An Ethereum accountSimilar to AlamoFire, the most recently loaded wallet is used for all operations such as changing password and signing.Example: Change Your PasswordTo change the password of the most recently loaded account, do the following which returns Bool for success/failurelet result = EthAccountCoordinator.default.updatePassword(\"qwerty\", newPassphrase: \"qwerty1234!\")Or you can pass in the account you want to changedo {   try keystoreA.update(accountA, passphrase: \"qwerty\", newPassphrase: \"qwerty1234!\")} catch {   print(\"Update password failed\")}Example: Send 50 GMT from Wallet B to Wallet A1. Create wallet Blet configB = EthAccountConfiguration(namespace: \"walletB\", password: \"12345\")let (keystoreB, accountB): (GethKeyStore?,GethAccount?) = EthAccountCoordinator.default.launch(configB)2. Start with the smart contract function and arguments Sending GMT utilizes the ERC-20 \u201ctransfer\u201d functionif let walletAAccountAddress: GethAddress = accountA?.getAddress() {   let amount = GethBigInt.bigInt(valueInEther:50)!   let transferFunction = EthFunction(name: \"transfer\", inputParameters: [walletAAccountAddress, amount])}2. Encode the \u201ctransfer\u201d functionIn order to execute a function on the blockchain we must encode the function name and its parameters following Ethereum rules.let encodedTransferFunction = web3swift.encode(transferFunction)print(\"\\(encodedTransferFunction.toHexString())\")Your output should look like this:c5e23ba100000000000000000000000000b51e934abfb2e159101014ba4b8c0f1b66dcea000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002b5e3af16b18800003. Sign the transactionYou must include the standard Ethereum parameters: contract address, nonce, gasLimit and gasPrice. It can be used to generate JSON or RLPdump.

This is the second initiative under the Status Projects umbrella, after Status Incubate was launched on April 20th.Iuri created Embark, one of the most adaptable and advanced DApp frameworks, back in 2015. His goal has been to provide easy-to-use developer tools that will foster a vibrant decentralized web, while nevertheless implementing advanced features in Embark which allow experienced engineers to build production systems with confidence.Status shares the same vision as Embark: we want to build beautiful, intuitive and easy-to-use tools that nevertheless provide our users with as much power and confidence as they require. We are humbled and inspired to be able to collaborate with people who are so passionate about making sure that Ethereum as a whole succeeds.\u201cI started working on Embark in 2015 when developer tooling was practically non-existent, and barriers to DApp development were significantly higher than today\u201d said Iuri Matias. \u201cEmbark demonstrated that tooling makes DApp development less intimidating for first time DApp developers, and hastens the path to creating production-ready decentralized applications. Now, by partnering with Status, we can speed up development, making the framework more powerful and streamlined for developers everywhere.\u201dIuri has been a long time contributor to ethereum and the web3 ecosystem. He is the creator of EtherSim, which later became TestRPC (now ganache) and is currently contributing to the Remix project with the Ethereum Foundation. We believe that by supporting incredible technologists like Iuri and the rest of the Embark team, we can help developers around the world create DApps of their own, building towards a robust web3 experience for everyone.By joining forces with Status, Iuri has been able to grow his team and implement some unique and powerful features in Embark. Not only can you build production DApps, you can also connect and upload to IPFS or Swarm very easily. You can even pull contracts and libraries directly from URLs, making it easy to leverage the most advanced and secure open source work currently being doneEmbark also comes with a unique set a modular plugins to help make your life even easier when it comes to debugging, linting, building for webpack, or connecting to platforms like Status. You can even write your own plugins to solve your unique problem cases. It really is the most flexible and powerful framework we at Status have seen. Through its plug and play solution for mobile DApp development, Embark is the perfect solution for developers looking to build mobile first decentralized applications.There are a number of talented developers eager to get involved and create decentralized applications\u2013with Embark, they can now dive right in and start bringing their projects to life. Embark allows us to move closer to a decentralized world and continue to create new and better products and services built on networks we all share.The time is nowThe Status app is is making great progress as core contributors and community members are pushing the product forward. The latest release, 0.9.17, introduced a number of new and exciting DApps such as CryptoKitties, CrytpoCribs, Bancor and many more. As Status becomes more stable and widely used, we need talented developers taking their decentralized projects from proof-of -concept to production. Embark by Status makes this easy to do.A number of projects are moving onto mainnet in 2018, further proving that we can all create and deploy DApps with genuine utility. For those who have been around since the beginning, like Iuri, it has been fascinating to watch the mainstream media latch onto what we\u2019re doing, and to see so many developers working with Web2 technologies come and explore with us the possibilities of Web3.Embark is the perfect tool to satisfy such developer\u2019s curiosity and keep them building awesome products by making the experience of building the next generation of decentralized applications smooth and intuitive.Embark into The EtherEmbark provides developers with a highly adaptable framework to create truly decentralized applications. Embark already enables developers to spin up private ethereum blockchains, develop smart contracts, leverage IPFS and Swarm for decentralized file storage, Whisper for decentralized communication, as well as integrate with any web technology, including React, Foundation, and Angular.This is just the start. Status will support Iuri and the Embark team through:Recruitment and building out the Embark teamTechnical support from Status Core contributorsMarketing efforts to attract new and talented developers to use the frameworkThe Embark by Status team has already grown through the addition of three new members. Jonathan Rainville, RJ Catalano, and Eric Mastro are the first to join Iuri in pushing the framework to new heights. The team has just launched Embark 3.0 and is now focused on pushing the framework to new heights.Advancing the decentralized webWe have launched Status Incubate and Embark by Status with the goal of making the decentralized web a reality. We are committed to this vision and will continue to support those who share it.Have an idea for a DApp? Looking for some support in kickstarting your project?

Both short term and long term scaling solutions are required if the vision of web3 is to materialise. At the Web3 Foundation, we\u2019re cultivating discussion around scalability. Our initiatives aim to provide guidance to teams searching for immediate scaling solutions and foster collaboration between projects currently working on those solutions. With this in mind, this article has two aims:1) Investigate Proof-of-Authority chains and propose them as a viable short term scaling solution, and2) Invite teams currently working on scaling solutions to the forthcoming event: ScalingNOW! that we\u2019re co-hosting with Giveth on 5th and 6th March in Barcelona.What is \u2018Scalability\u2019?In the context of Ethereum, we define scalability as the capacity of the mainchain to improve performance (throughput, latency) as the number of users (DApps) increases, without making a difference to the users experience (gas prices, transaction times). The network architecture must be able to adapt to new demands as adoption increases, not the other way around.Current State of EthereumToday, Ethereum isn\u2019t scalable. But it\u2019s worth remembering, it was designed this way, the same way as all blockchain protocols. Every full-node stores all the state data while processing transactions which include smart contact code, account balances, and storage. This ensures a high level of security but scalability is compromised. Fortunately, the scaffolding required to scale Ethereum is under construction. Examples include, Cosmos, Sharding, Plasma, Raiden and Polkadot, to name a few. These technologies have been well covered elsewhere. Instead, in this article we will focus on one example of a readily available scaling solution: Proof-of-Authority chains.The ProblemDApps need immediate scaling solutions. Without one, problems start to arise: first, a roadblock is created for testing and launching. Heavy traffic equates to low throughput and high transaction fees. This makes it prohibitively expensive to deploy a DApp on the mainnet. Second, a lot of mainnet-ready projects are in limbo, searching for an immediate solution. Finally, network congestion and high transaction fees discourage future projects from building on top of Ethereum, in favour of other networks. Currently there is no magic wand and all chains suffer from the same problems which Vitalik Buterin has labeled the \u2018Scalability Trilema\u2019:The trilema maintains that blockchains are currently limited to possessing only two of the following three attributes:ScalabilityDecentralizationSecurityVitalik believes there are two questions: 1) Can we conceive a new system where only a few nodes verify each transaction? Security could be maintained by ensuring enough nodes authenticate each transaction. 2) Could throughput be maximised by having sufficiently few nodes laterally verifying multiple transactions? Vitalik was asking these questions in the context of sharding, however, his intuition is also relevant to describing Proof-of-Authority chains, in our view.Proposed Interim SolutionAt Web3 we support the following short-term solution: deploy a Proof-of Authority network and connect to the mainnet using a bridge (example bridges include Parity and Grid+). The advantage is PoA doesn\u2019t rely on nodes finding solutions to subjective mathematical problems. Instead a pre-selected group of authorities called \u2018validators\u2019 secure the blockchain and are allowed to create new blocks. They are the actors with notary public license who steward the network. In other words all their identities are public and verifiable by any third party.Although Proof-of-Authority is a more recent idea in the blockchain space, it is gathering momentum as an interim scaling solution due to a number of advantages. First, it is arguably more secure (a compromised validator cannot take control of the network or reverse previous transactions in the chain). Second, it is much more efficient in block production due to lower levels of friction on the network. Finally and most importantly, bridged chains imply that operations on the PoA chain can be transacted almost without cost.Thinking About Trust and GovernancePoA chains change the trust equation. No longer is trust ensured by the proven Ethereum Proof-of-Work consensus. Now trust resides in the supermajority of the validators. Whilst the number of validators impacts the networks distribution, more important for security is the level of diversity amongst the validators. The point is not to have your validators concentrated in one industry sub sector since they could be tempted to collude together.Source: Proof of Authority: consensus model with identity at stake, November 2017. (POA Network, Medium)PoA is an adapted version of Proof of Stake where a validator\u2019s public identity performs the role of proof of stake. The validators could be well known startups, DApps or blue chip organisations. With their identity at stake, they are incentivised to act in the best interest of the network. In terms of consensus, a super majority must be reached by the validators in order for the chain to be signed off. When this is the case it becomes a permanent part of the chain. In summary, PoA consensus is a good fit for private chains. It may facilitate a quicker, more scalable and more cost effective blockchain, thereby enabling DApps and prospective blue-chip projects to launch or test their innovative ideas freely and easily.PoA Chain ExamplesPoA is readily available and is either being considered or utilised by a number of projects within the ecosystem. Some examples include: Giveth, POA Network, TomoChain, Rublix, Swarm City, Colony and GoChain. The two ethereum testnets Kovan and Rinkeby also use a PoA consensus algorithm.Limitations of Proof-of-AuthorityThe key to PoA is that trust is predetermined. Consensus is achieved by a preselected number of validators, unlike Proof-of-Stake where the consensus is achieved amongst the parties which submitted a security deposit. The PoA model introduces a centralised element to the equation. We accept this, but argue that this is appropriate within a consortium setting. Take the banking industry as an example. Is anything gained by using validators from totally unrelated industries\u2019 validating blocks? For example, why should a consortium of coffee producers in Central America be required to validate blocks on the banks private chain? One possible answer: in order to prevent collusion, the network should be as distributed as possible. Agreed \u2014 but what if we could achieve just enough decentralisation so as to fully secure the network, but not too much so as to compromise the network\u2019s scalability? For example, trust could be distributed across an industrial network such as banks, regulators, unions, custodians, lawyers, exchanges etc. With their identity at stake, all actors would be incentivized to act in the interest of maintaining their public reputation, which in turn is in the best interest of the the network. Further, additional layers of protection could also be added such as fines, removal of regulatory permissions and other preventive measures could be written in smart contracts which execute the moment any malicious actors are detected by the network.We appreciate more work is needed to explore fully the trust equation and the intricacies of the governance model. It will likely be slightly different for every network application. We also see PoA chains as part of an interim solution, not the final solution. Any shortcomings with regards governance and security will most likely be filled by future protocols such as Polkadot.Polkadot: a Long Term Scaling SolutionSource: Polkadot LightpaperPolkadot is being designed as a fully scalable blockchain which will act as a deployment and interaction testbed for new blockchain technologies. Polkadot is a scalable multichain. Which means that unlike current blockchains which focus on providing single chain solutions, Polkadot is designed to provide no inherent functionality at all. Instead Polkadot provides the bedrock \u2018relay chain\u2019 upon which a large number chains can run in parallel, these are called \u2018parachains.\u2019 In terms of trust, parachains connect to the security offered by a relay chain, instead of providing its own. Relay chains offer security to attached parachains and also certify the security of messages travelling between them. Unlike a proof-of-authority style network, Polkadot is envisaged to be deployable as a network in a fully open and public situation without any particular organisation or trusted authority required to maintain it.In preparation for the arrival of Polkadot, developers may need to test how their application functions across multiple chains. Features such as token migration from one chain to another will require development and testing. Launching private PoA chains could be one option allowing for such testing to be carried out. Whilst we admit PoA networks are not the holy grail in solving Vitalik\u2019s \u2018Scalbility Trilema\u2019, they could at the very least be useful as part of the preparation for the arrival of multichain scalability solutions such as Polkadot. This is another reason we believe experimenting with private chains and PoA consensus could add value both in the short and long term.Engaging With The CommunityAs advocates of a decentralised web, the Web3 Foundation acts as a resource and a support network to the community working on it. We are actively looking to engage with projects within the ecosystem who are abutting the limits of Ethereum. We aim to be a critical source of information regarding the various scaling challenges projects face, and more importantly, how we can tackle them. We are looking to connect with projects and individuals on an ongoing basis on the needs and challenges they face when considering implementing a PoA network.With this is mind, on 5th-6th March we are hosting, in collaboration with Giveth, a two day \u2018ScalingNOW!\u2019 Gathering in Barcelona. Representatives from Cosmos, POA Network, Parity, Truebit, Counterfactual, Giveth and Raiden are joining and the invitation is extended to all DApp developers in need of immediate scaling solutions. Please find the invitation for the 5th (for those working on immediate scaling solutions) here and for the 6th (for all DApp developers needing immediate scaling solutions) here.Where Next?Ethereum isn\u2019t ready for DApp deployment which leaves a lot of projects in limbo, unable to test or launch their products. While we wait for more extensive scaling solutions, such as Polkadot, to arrive, we advocate launching a PoA chain. We firmly believe that rolling out a PoA chain will allow for a faster, more cost effective and a more expandable blockchain. Finally, at Web3, were looking to promote community collaboration via our upcoming initiatives. We encourage you to join us at ScalingNOW! in Barcelona. We hope you are able to attend, contribute and bring fresh ideas to the ongoing scalability debate thereby enabling forward progression towards a fully decentralised web.Connecting With Web3For those of you unable to join us in Barcelona, we welcome you to join our Riot channel to ask any questions or collaborate:#ScalingEthereum:matrix.orgAs always with our Web3 workshops, we\u2019ll be sure to post a recap of our collective findings and next steps.Anything you think we missed in our post?

It\u2019s not that we\u2019ve been ignorant to the topic but it finally bumped up our list of priorities. It\u2019s gone from a Lukewarm talking point, to sizzling hot.Coinbases Connie Yang::: Why design is the killer app for crypto and ENS\u2019s Beltran:: Web3 Design Principles are two of the best. I personally took inspiration from Beltran\u2019s piece & TTT concept, highly recommend both.So far we\u2019ve seen that adoption of Web3 apps has been directly proportionate to the quality of the UX regardless of how trustless it is. Augur took the top spot from Cryptokitties this year for the most popular dApp. It\u2019s easy to see how they are head and shoulders above the rest at this insurmountable task of making Web3 easy.Zinc (zinc.work) is in the identity & reputation space (obvious disclosure, I work at Zinc). We face most of these general Web3 design challenges. Such as transaction transparency, exposing where data is stored, what\u2019s permanent/what\u2019s not and who might see this public chain \u00b1\u00b1\u00b1\u00b1. Some are key design challenges to our identity & reputation.The primary benefit of the technology we\u2019re choosing to build on is TRUST. To expose this benefit to the user we have to be transparent in everything we do but abstract away complexity. This is tough, since blockchains are complex, mythical beasts to the average user. Beltran introduces this Trust through transparency concept, stating; \u201cIf it isn\u2019t transparent it can\u2019t be trusted!\u201d. This resonated with me when thinking on the Web3 accessibility challenge. The challenge of exposing benefits of the underlying technology whilst ensuring Web2 level UX. Many web3 companies seem to use blockchain as their headline differentiator. To justify shouting about the technology we\u2019ve chosen to build on we must expose it\u2019s benefits. Nobody is choosing to build on a blockchain for speed or ease of use! Not yet anyway\u2026Identity & Reputation system design considerationsI\u2019m going to highlight some generic benefits of building web3 identity & reputation systems. Then I\u2019ll explain the design principles we considered when informing users on what they need to know to realise these benefits. Then show some real dApp snapshots\u2026 some more relevant than others. All through transparency.Identity app benefit:: create immutable identity proofs, then share proofs without exposing any of your original data.The user needs to know where their data is stored.The user needs to know what data is being shared.The user needs to know who has access to where their data is stored.The user needs to know what is visible when they share a proof.I like this example from Aragon because they don\u2019t withhold any backend information. You can edit the Node you connect to and you get the feeling you\u2019re in control of your data.http://aragon.aragonpm.com/Identity app benefit:: Have true ownership and control of your data in a decentralised network rather than have it sitting on centralised servers.The user needs to know where their data is stored.The user needs to know exactly what control they have over their data.The user needs to understand the permanent nature of the proofs before they are created.An example of transparency in transactions when signing into Bloom. Too often, we cannot tell what we\u2019re signing or exactly what is being shared in the transaction.\u201cPlease sign text so you can sign-in\u201d Bloom.coReputation app benefit:: portable reputation, transferable across the web.The user needs to understand why they don\u2019t currently own their web2 reputations.The user needs to see that they can access and remove data if they wish to know they are not tied to a new evil (new data monopoly)The user needs to needs to be aware of the open nature of the system.Zinc\u2018s block explorer exposes each individual users identity contracts resolving ENS names. It\u2019s a human readable way of saying to users, the proofs you collect here are on the public Ethereum net. Zinc can\u2019t censor you, you can connect to these contracts and port these proofs anywhere.https://zinc.work/Reputation app benefit:: Monetise and gameify social reputations through digital assets.Users need to understand when they are exchanging value.Users need to be educated on the value their social profiles have and who profits from this value currently.Users need to be informed what they are signing or transferring in human readable text.Gitcoin do great job of gamifying and adding incentives mechanisms to social systems & reputations. They use a ranking system with a leaderboard to show which users are open source stars.https://gitcoin.co/Reputation app benefit:: verified, uncensored information, feedback you can trust.The user needs to understand the permanency of proofs.The user needs to be exposed to all the verification measures to understand the validity of data.The user needs to be warned about the open and permanent nature of information before they are asked to submit data.Zinc also demonstrates transparency in transactions with the message signing (ala Bloom). In the example profile below you can see each work proof\u2019s (reference) provenance is transparent with a blockchain logo that links though to the data transaction.https://zinc.work/These dApps tend to score well since they achieve trust through transparency. They expose the backend and explain it in an easy to understand way. This is a tightrope though and most dApps lose their balance and fall either side of this. When this happens, the trust benefit falls by the wayside too. It\u2019s a thin tightrope between two mountains on a gusty day in 2018. Most dApps pre 2018 would under design and expose too much complexity for the average user, which had really killed dApp accessibility. Some fall the other side and over design. They cut corners on the trust and end up with something identical to a Web2 app.With shared public backends we have an opportunity to win users trust through transparency. If we don\u2019t exercise this opportunity, we might as well be using web2 tools. Wielding web2 tech, you can hardly say \u201chere are our logins, have a poke around our redshift. Feel free to kick the tyres on our S3 buckets. Go ahead and take a DB admin role for a spin over the next few months.\u201d Sounds outrageous, but we do have this opportunity with web3, so let\u2019s exercise it! Let\u2019s make it easy for users to interact with contracts and see that transaction histories cannot be censored.Once we learn to walk this tightrope and we see others successfully pass across, knowledge sharing will become easier. We can build tools, bridges and standardise this tricky approach.

It is the promise of an interconnected serverless internet, i.e. the decentralized web. An internet where users are in control of their own data, identity and destiny.This goal for the internet to progress to is an advanced form of value to be built on distributed ledger technology, beyond the initial proven use cases of digital scarce value with Bitcoin, and then programmable money with Ethereum.The Web3 internet is built on fundamentally different infrastructure, utilizing blockchains and distributed peer-to-peer networks, compared to the current existing internet which rely on server-client relationships. To adapt to this new infrastructure, new methods of handling and interacting with data in a decentralized context need to be developed to account for the open, transparent and distributed nature in which Web3 applications operate.Completely new applications will be enabled by this technology, by building with structures that eliminate reliance on corrupt/censoring central authorities. They will leverage immutability and open economic incentive systems to generate highly accurate and verified information without trusting other parties.The following projects have built tools that serve as useful examples of how data can be managed in Web3.FOAM ProtocolFOAM Protocol is an open protocol for decentralized, geospatial data markets, that has the goal to build a consensus-driven map of the world that can be trusted for every application.FOAM Protocol is a unique example of an application that can only exist effectively using the decentralized data management principles and incentivisation mechanisms that Web3 technology can provide. FOAM uses tokens to create economic incentives for the validation of geospatial data, to build a universal consensus-driven map and standard for location data and its exchange. It is what FOAM describes as \u2018programmable space\u2019.By creating economic incentives for an open-source location standard, a much more accurate and universal standard for location data and exchange should be able to develop on FOAM to solve problems of location data monetization, interoperability of location data and verification of location data. Supporting technologies and use cases such as IOT networks, supply chain, logistics and enhanced location intelligence (e.g. mobility AI).The core principles behind FOAM rely on the immutability and transparency of the Ethereum blockchain where values are represented in FOAM smart contracts, allowing participants to actively verify data. With base fundamentals of decentralized technology, FOAM is then able to build on top of this a verification layer built with a token curated registry(TCR), where users can stake reputation and tokens to vouch for the location data accuracy, and be rewarded for providing and verifying the correct data. This provably verified data can then either be leveraged into applications, such as in open tools like FOAM\u2019s visualiser or available for exchange in data marketplaces.FOAM is a prime example of how data can be managed, verified and improved for a specific purpose and ultimately with Web3 we will see more applications arise that leverage the stronger verification and wisdom able to be sourced from economically incentivised crowds with open and transparent standards.DIRT ProtocolDIRT Protocol provides another example of how data could be managed in a decentralized Web3 context by utilizing Token Curated Registeries (TCRs). DIRT Protocol is a standard for people to create openly editable, Community Moderated Datastores on Ethereum.The idea behind DIRT is that it creates a framework for data to be community owned and managed without any central authorities, and provide a means for the data to be accurate and readily available for any service or application that requires it.Essentially this functions in the same way as FOAM\u2019s verification layer where any user can contribute to the shared database, but must place tokens at stake as an economic incentive to provide quality data and receive rewards for verifying the accuracy of the data.This framework enables an entirely new concept of \u2018Trust as a service\u2019 as described by DIRT, removing the likelihood of single party manipulation and improving accuracy through crowd-sourced participation. The first iteration of an application based on this standard is OpenMarketCap a token curated alternative to CoinMarketCap to create a more trustworthy cryptocurrency trade data source in an industry that suffers inaccurate and at times very dishonest data.ChainLinkChainLink is a decentralized data management solution that focuses on data external to blockchain systems, aiming to solve the \u2018smart contract connectivity\u2019 or \u2018oracle problem\u2019. That is, due to the decentralization and tamper-proof properties of smart contracts, they lack connectivity to external data points as they form critical centralizing points of failure as oracle data inputs control the behaviour of the \u2018trustless\u2019 smart contract system.ChainLink provides a secure, decentralized tamper-proof blockchain middleware, bridging data sources, payments and APIs to smart contracts, as well as providing a framework for easing access to multiple inputs and outputs for smart contracts.ChainLink allows any user to run an oracle and take part in the network. ChainLink then aggregates the multiple oracle data sources for usage for each particular feed, such that the system can provide redundancy and accuracy for the end user data.Marketplace based incentives dictate the ChainLink system operation with data users making payments to the oracles providing the data sources, and therefore alongside the reputation and staking mechanisms, data users can dictate to what level they value data accuracy and redundancy as higher payments incentivise greater honesty amongst oracles and more participants as the potential reward increases.Currently the status of ChainLink\u2019s mainnet, is that its smart contract aggregator only operates with a static list of four trusted oracles seen here. It is planned that the number of oracles sourced from will expand and oracle participants will build reputation and stake LINK tokens as collateral which are lost if bad data is provided, but this is yet to be operational on mainnet.Ultimately ChainLink has demonstrated so far, that interacting with external data and managing its inputs, outputs and interactions with decentralized systems will be one of the most crucial building blocks for Web3 technology, and therefore projects that build solutions for the oracle problem will become significant players.It is likely that many iterations and improvements will be made and will be needed in oracle design such that interacting with blockchain applications and the outside world becomes fully seamless and secure for a raft of new decentralized applications to be fully realized.Band ProtocolBand is an open protocol that facilitates the governance of data used in decentralized blockchain systems. The protocol functions as an open standard for data handling and management for any decentralized program or application that requires trusted and reliable data.Building on shared principles of ChainLink, FOAM and DIRT, Band Protocol provides the infrastructure for secure and effective Web3 applications to be made by packaging up the core fundamental tools for decentralized data management into simple building blocks with infrastructure developed for off-chain oracles, identity management systems, token issuances and token curated registries.Combining these tools will mean that Band Protocol is effective in four key areas:Data Valuation & Price DiscoveryDataset tokens and issuance with bonding curves for effective data monetizationDelegated CurationManagement of data feeds and oracles for external data interactionsDirect CurationToken curated registries for management of community controlled datasourcesPrivate Data GovernanceInformation sharing and decentralized reputation standards for secure and private data utilization within decentralized systemsWhile other aspects to Web3 may prove to be more critical in future, the mechanisms for data management are crucial problems that need to be solved for effective Web3 applications to be implemented today and at Band we believe we\u2019ve created some of the most usable and holistic tools across the board for this purpose.We continue to build with our mainnet deployment fast approaching.

Surprisingly, it was first formulated around the 19th century, together with the concept of centralization itself. Before that time people did not really give much thought to the general principles of the things they built, be it society\u2019s structure or technology. Creation of huge nation states drew attention to the general principles of society structure, and brought about suspicion that rigid vertical structures had their own drawbacks. Rigid hierarchy and chain of command do make a lot of sense in many situations, but this always creates centralized point of failure, making systems vulnerable and corruptible.In the late 20th century technology started to have an overwhelming effect on the development of society. Computer networks became the veins through which society\u2019s blood flows; tech that we build has a huge impact on the society we live in. The concept of decentralized technology started to take shape in the late 70s, in the form of distributed computing and consensus research.The real breakthrough, at least in people\u2019s minds, came with blockchain technology. For the first time in the history of human technology we were able to create truly decentralized systems controlled only by the protocol we feed into them. Blockchain is now more than 10 years old, and although we can\u2019t do all the things we want with it just yet, we can do enough to try and go beyond prototypes and working use-cases. Mass adoption, that Holy Grail of any emerging technology, must be found ASAP, since the time has come. WEB2.0 corporations have come to hold too much power. We did not notice how they gained access to tons of sensitive and valuable big data, and now we have the kind of monopoly that just can\u2019t last.WEB3.0, the concept which emerged at the end of the last century, is finally shaping up in the first real products that unify a host of different technologies (Big Data, AI, IoT\u2026) on a decentralized footing. To kick-start the revolution it is of vital importance to create retail WEB3.0 products and working enterprise applications now. We need to go beyond the crypto-community to make the ideas that emerged within it truly work.We can\u2019t achieve full decentralization just yet, and actually we might never achieve it. To make WEB3.0 a really useful concept we need to understand that the end-goal of WEB3.0 is the creation of robust, transparent, synergetic systems by any means necessary. Decentralizing critical business logic and using centralized tech where we can\u2019t do without it (storage, complicated computation), we are able to create products that can gain mass adoption now, where there\u2019s a real need in a new approach in the systems we are building. Data storage can be enhanced and allow for privacy protection. It\u2019s time to get down to some fancy and sophisticated cryptography, such as homomorphic encryption, and really make it work. In the near future, I\u2019m sure, we\u2019ll also be able to use verifiable computation, using which one can outsource computation to third-parties and obtain verifiable results.The decentralized layer, of course, has to be improved to solve scalability issues that riddle blockchain systems now. Waves\u2019 RIDE smart contracts language update will provide a new approach to decentralized computation and business logic, which is closer to the nature of blockchain systems. It will be on the Waves mainnet by June. Waves-NG maximizes what you can get from on-chain transactions in terms of speed. To go further you need either to move off-chain or create custom sidechains, that process specific sets of transactions. The second approach is closer to our philosophy of getting the maximum from the current technology before moving forward, and it will be implemented in the second half of 2019. Future systems may (and probably should) give up on total network synchronization completely, but there\u2019s still a long way to go, and the current technology is mature enough to disrupt WEB 2.0 architecture.The gateway to our WEB3.0 world is going to be our Waves Keeper. Storing private keys user-side and not trusting any sensitive data to third parties is the key to WEB3, and Keeper does exactly that.The next architecture level is the Decentralized Business logic layer. Sensitive business logic running on smart contracts, encrypted important private data, monetization through tokenization \u2014 it all goes there. Going deeper we arrive at the Centralized Layer, which soaks up WEB3 ideas as well \u2014 data is encrypted, computation is verifiable.Based on this architecture we\u2019re building several applications now, with mass adoption in mind.They tap into diverse markets but are unified by the ideas of tokenization, being accessible to a mass audience, and providing an unparalleled level of transparency.We are building a decentralized voting platform. This is one of the most promising directions for distributed tech. Its usage on the municipal level is starting to happen- and its widespread application is inevitable. Transparent, anonymous and verifiable voting can change the game completely.We build a social network. It might seem too ambitious but this is just the right moment to do it. Privacy preserving, tokenized social network can be a huge leap forward for social interaction. We know how to do it, and you\u2019ll see a prototype this summer.We\u2019re launching Vostok network, our WEB3.0 solution for enterprise. Any implementation of blockchain tech in enterprise is WEB3.0 by default, since only a combination of different technologies, on a decentralized footing, can make sense in a corporate environment. Without it blockchain is just a weird database.We don\u2019t solely do blockchain tech any longer; it is just a part of a bigger picture. We\u2019re becoming the first company that focuses exclusively on monetizable WEB3.0 applications. We want to become one of the first Googles or Facebooks of the future Internet.

Chainlink\u2019s open source oracle system provides smart contracts in the Web 3.0 ecosystem with decentralized oracles that will reliably connect those contracts with key off-chain resources like data feeds, APIs and various payment methods. As part of the collaboration, Chainlink plans to create an implementation for the Polkadot project, making a large amount of off-chain data feeds, various APIs, and traditional payment services available to all contracts on the Polkadot network.Chainlink uses a decentralized oracle network (multiple Chainlinks nodes) to validate the data before it triggers the contract. This eliminates single points of failure and maintains the overall value of a highly secure, reliable, and trustworthy smart contract. Data made available by the oracles parachain, that Chainlink plans to implement, can be leveraged by all blockchains in the Polkadot network. This data can be used to trigger smart contract messages and settle transactions across different chains.\u201cOracles are a critical component of the Web 3.0 ecosystem,\u201d explains W3F Executive Director Peter Czaban, \u201cenabling a new wave of exciting decentralized applications that require access to real world data on the blockchain.

Slides. Video.]The Shadow Data EconomyThe May 2017 cover story of The Economist to frame data as \u201cthe world\u2019s most valuable resource\u201d. On the back of data, Google, Facebook and a handful of other companies have built businesses with a combined market cap of more than a trillion dollars. For them, data is money: more data means better AI models, means better-targeted ads, means more ad clicks, means more revenue. Follow the money; it leads back to data.We have a data economy. But it\u2019s a shadow data economy. It\u2019s opaque: Google and the like keep the data to themselves for competitive reasons (data siloes). And, power is concentrated, such as Zuckerberg with his fiefdom of 2 billion people.Can we shift the data economy to one that is open and permissionless? This is our goal at Ocean Protocol. Fortunately, we have inspiration\u2026The Money EconomyIn 2005, a strawberry picker named Alberto Ramirez with $15,000/year income got a loan to buy a house for $720,000. He had no chance of paying it off. How was this possible? As with data: follow the money. The lenders made tremendous money off the fees. They\u2019d figured out how to get \u201cno chance\u201d loans rated as quality loans with tricks like credit default swaps. Lipstick on a pig.In 2008, the house of cards came crashing down. Trillions in value were lost. Taxpayers paid the bill. The bankers collected their bonuses and zipped their lips.It was a shadow money economy with the feds and the banks. It was opaque, with power concentrated in the hands of few.Enter Bitcoin! Satoshi explicitly pointed to the financial crisis as why she (;) created Bitcoin. Bitcoin has sparked the blockchain movement. As part of that movement, the token economy is opening up money: transparent and permissionless.The token economy is our inspiration. Just as we\u2019ve been opening up money with the blockchain movement, let\u2019s open up data as well.Let\u2019s move from a shadow data economy that is opaque with concentrated power, to a Web3 data economy that is transparent and permissionless.The question is, how? And, what does this actually look like? Surprisingly, it begins with AI (artificial intelligence).Towards an Open Data EconomyFrom data, you get value. The crucial step to go from one to the other is AI models. The more data you have, the more accurate your model, the more revenue. AI is the linchpin.Enterprises, NGOs, and governments have plenty of data, and AI problems. AI startups have plenty of AI expertise. Few have both.There\u2019s actually tons of data out there within enterprises (the Fortune 500 companies), NGOs, and governments. While they have data, they don\u2019t have AI expertise. They have a tough time attracting AI researchers to come. Why? Because the AI experts have gone off to form their own startups to try to make money from AI.And those startups are finding \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 they don\u2019t have any data!There\u2019s only a small handful of companies that have both data and AI expertise: Google, Facebook and few others. That\u2019s it. This small group of organizations is accruing all the value. AI is the linchpin.What if we could connect the data haves \u2014 people with the data \u2014 with the AI haves \u2014 people with AI expertise that are starving for data?To do so, imagine we could create a substrate that connects these folks. A substrate that helps to equalize the opportunities for leveraging the value of AI and data.The image below elaborates. On the top are the main users: problem owners, and problem solvers. At the bottom is the connective substrate. In between is connective-tissue middleware: marketplaces side-by-side with AI commons, and data science tools.On the problem owner side, governments often have mandates to open up their data. This includes city/municipal governments, all the way up to state/provincial governments and national governments. UN agencies and other NGOs are trying to work with data but, like the enterprises. As described before, AI expertise can be hard for enterprises to attain; this challenge extends to governments and NGOs.For data, the demand side is easy. AI loves data. More precisely, data scientists know that their AI models can leverage as much data as supplied.So, it\u2019s really about getting the supply side going. We do this with the yin and yang of priced and free data. Consider having tens or hundreds of data marketplaces, buying and selling data for different industries and verticals \u2014 for automotive for medical and so on \u2014 as well as a data commons. Side by side with priced data, there will be free data, with incentives for people to supply that free data. And if we put problem definitions into the commons as well, with incentives to solve the problems, we get an AI Commons.ApplicationsLet\u2019s explore specific applications for a Web3 data substrate.Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). AVs promise much greater mobility at lower costs. But we need AV accident rates to be lower. To do so, we need more data: RAND calculated we need 500 billion miles driven. Individually, big automakers have calculated that they\u2019d need 10\u201320 years to get this much data. BMW, GM and others formed MOBI Foundation as a means to pool their data; and are leveraging Ocean Web3 data substrate.Health. Earlier detection of cancer leads to earlier treatment, saving lives. A friend of mine builds Genetic Programming models to predict cancer. He\u2019s happy if he has a dataset of 100 points, which, alas, means his models have poor predictive ability. Furthermore, each hospital site has bias due to differences in data collection, like how long a sample sits in a Petri dish before it\u2019s measured. What if we could build models from data in 10 or 100 or more hospitals, while preserving privacy? There\u2019s a way: bring the compute to the data, and build a model across hospitals using federated learning.This is the direction for ConnectedLife, working on Parkinson\u2019s, and leveraging Ocean Web3 data substrate.Agriculture. A spinoff from the World Economic Forum called Grow Asia is about giving farmers way more data such that they can more accurately predict how much fertilizer to put in, how much seed to give and so on. They\u2019re iterating with Ocean Web3 data substrate.Policymaking. For the new European data privacy rules (GDPR), the policymakers designed rules based on the technology of the time. It wasn\u2019t easy. Some of it is perhaps heavy-handed but there are benefits too. But imagine if you could thread the needle better simply because there\u2019s better optionality to address privacy yet get economic benefits from AI& data. The government of Singapore\u2019s data authorities (IMDA) are iterating with Ocean Web3 data substrate for this purpose.The AI Commons. There\u2019s an \u201cAI for Good\u201d movement, epitomized by the \u201cAI for Good\u201d Summit which last year had >40 UN agencies, learning how to use AI for the UN 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Their people have boots-on-the-ground AI-style problems to solve, and they have data. But they aren\u2019t connected to the people that know how to solve the problems \u2014 the data scientists. We could do one-off connections via networking. Or we can scale it up in a Web3 data substrate for an AI Commons.What does a data *economy* look like?This piece has discussed motivations for an open, permissionless Web3 data economy; inspiration from the money economy; what a data substrate for that economy looks like; and applications. But what does this actually look like as an economy?InspirationWe can once again turn to the money economy for inspiration. Let\u2019s unpack elements of the open, permissive token economy. (A simplified model, but nonetheless potentially useful.)The bottom row is the base layer of the token economy. There\u2019s the reserve currency or store of value: Bitcoin. There\u2019s the app platform, or unit of exchange, like Ethereum. And finally the app funding platform, Ethereum, as well. SAFTs as well these days too.In the middle row are \u201clast miles\u201d for utility. These are dApps.On the top row are \u201clast miles\u201d for the economic layer. This includes the custodians / wallets like Coinbase, Tresor, and Metamask. It includes token exchanges like GDAX and Binance. Finally, it includes mining such as Bitmain.What if the data economy looked like the token economy? (At least as a first approximation.) Let\u2019s picture this, in the image below.Once again we have the reserve currency, the unit of exchange, the data or asset funding platform and then the utility & economic last miles.Elements of a Web3 Data EconomyNext, how do we instantiate this data economy? We need to fill in each of the blue boxes. Let\u2019s explore a possible way to do it, based on the current (but subject to change!) design of Ocean Protocol.Users can stake on data assets in the context of bonding curves (details). These are used as a signal for relevance of a dataset X. The more you stake on X, the more relevant or popular you believe it will be, and the more block rewards you\u2019ll expect when you serve it up.A bonding curve (BC) is an automated market maker, a robot that\u2019s always there to buy or sell one token for another, for a price. For data asset X, the BC starts off selling tokens called \u201c\u1e0cX\u201d, drops of X, in exchange for Ocean tokens \u201c\u1ecc\u201d. There are initially 0 \u1e0cX. But once someone start buying \u1e0cX for cheap, the BC mints more tokens. \u1e0cX tokens get more expensive with each new purchase. If you sell some \u1e0cX, they burns. It\u2019s a continuous cycle of minting or burning.Base layer: Data asset funding platform. Each time you publish a data asset and initialize a bonding curve, you\u2019re also starting a \u201cmini ICO\u201d. People can purchase tokens, where each token carries some rights to expected income from block rewards. Initially, there\u2019s no tokens. But as soon as someone starts staking into it, then it\u2019s issuing those tokens of that data asset.Base layer: Reserve currency. Bonding curves have built-in reserve currency behavior. The area under the curve is actually a reserve, tying up liquidity. The more tokens that have been staked into one of these bonding curves, the more you have in reserve currency.Base layer: Unit of Exchange. A unit exchange comes from buying and selling data, and services for storage, compute, etc. The Web3 data substrate has mechanisms for doing so.To summarize, the Web3 data substrate fulfills the base layer of the data economy in terms of reserve currency /store of value, unit of exchange, and funding platform.On top of this base layer are the economic and utility \u201clast miles\u201d, as shown below. There\u2019s a lot going on here; let\u2019s unpack it.Economic last mile: Custodians/Wallets. Tokens can be managed with traditional crypto tools, like Metamask or Balance, or or even new wallets that are designed just for the data economy. We think we have the long tail of tokens right now in the token economy. In a data economy, we could have get orders of magnitude more tokens. There could be ten thousand data sets or even a million, each with its own token. It\u2019ll be interesting to see how that gets managed. Consider this a challenge for wallet builders!Economic last mile: data exchanges. Existing centralized data exchanges, decentralized data exchanges may find value increasing their data supply from the Web3 data substrate. Crypto token exchanges may find value in having *way* more tokens on their platforms.Economic last mile: service networks. In a Web3 data economy, \u201cminers\u201d are actually providers of data, and storage & compute services. They have three potential benefits: a new (potentially big) channel for customer acquisition; new capabilities for their customers (e.g. on-premise compute); and new revenue for them/their users via block rewards.Utility last mile. This is about about new powers for data scientists: more data, provenance, and new income opportunities. (Details.) Therefore, data science toolmakers may find benefit in leveraging a Web3 data substrate to better serve their data science users. We also expect interesting combinations of tools for economic and utility last mile, such as a Jupyter notebook with a built-in wallet and means to buy & sell data. Individual notebooks themselves, with their algorithms & know-how, will probably be interesting to buy & sell!In short, the Web3 data economy could a lot like the token economy.ConclusionData is money.

Two persons may exchange messages, conduct business, and negotiate electronic contracts without ever knowing the True Name, or legal identity, of the other\u2026 The technology for this revolution \u2014 and it surely will be both a social and economic revolution \u2014 has existed in theory for the past decade\u2026 And the next ten years will bring enough additional speed to make the ideas economically feasible and essentially unstoppable.This excerpt from The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto was written in 1988 \u2014 exactly 30 years ago \u2014 by Timothy May. His prediction that the 90s would fulfill the promise of a more free and fair web has not been achieved \u2014 instead five corporations control our online commerce, social media, and data. A small number of internet gatekeepers has rendered us as individual users vulnerable to the surveillance and manipulation scandals that have dominated headlines so far this century.The need for a decentralized, distributed, and trustless web is stronger than ever. The time to deliver on the promises of Web3 is now.For three days in October, we invite devs and researchers working on lower level protocols to join us in Berlin for an immersive and collaborative gathering focusing on the Web3 Tech Stack. These are the foundational technologies and protocols required to build the mainstream decentralized applications of the future:P2P protocols and networkingPlatform neutral computation languagesData distribution protocolsBlockchainsTransient data/messagingEncrypted storageProtocol-extensible developer APIsWe intend the Web3 Summit to mimic the ethos of Open Source: a fully collaborative congregation that is built, modified, and enhanced by those who participate. Our hope is to co-create a Summit that is not only focused on deeply pragmatic and technical problem solving, but one that is also really fun.We invite the community to participate in an inclusive program where *you* have the freedom to host, build, and create. You want to see a workshop on mixnets? We\u2019ll help you host one! Do you have research you\u2019d like to present on ring signatures or decentralized governance mechanisms? Hell yeah, we\u2019re here for it! Keen to host a boozy evening session of White Paper Karaoke? (Consider this a personal request/plea). We\u2019ve rented enough space for many different teams and individuals to contribute to the Summit, and we\u2019re looking forward to hearing your ideas.Apply to host a workshop or contribute to the hackerspace.Web3 Summit will have ample space available for workshops, both intimate and large scale presentations, AMA sessions, chill-out rooms, and most importantly \u2014 a 350 person hackerspace open 24/7 where you can camp out, host a hackathon, whiteboard some ideas, present to other teams, and collaboratively get real work done.In line with the Berlin-spirit (and because we know how to throw really awesome parties) Web3 Foundation will organize evening entertainment all through to the early hours of the morning. So if you need a break from building, we will make sure you have plenty of outlets to unwind and relax.In the coming weeks we will release further details on programming, workshops and tickets.

This is something that comes after Web 2.0 (let .0 stay, people loved that stuff of 1.0, 2.0 and so on when the term was invented). This is the best definition for Web3 actually, something which replaces Web2.0, and therefore is something different.So let\u2019s understand first what Web2.0 is. This is the Internet that we have now, with all those features that seem so nice but are meant to collect and control as much of your data as possible. They are bells and whistles that turn out to be the hammer and the anvil.Have you ever thought about where the immense wealth of Internet giants such as Google or Facebook comes from? In pre-Internet times such wealth used to be accumulated through an access to some resource and its explotation. It could be natural resources such as oil and gas or gold, manpower and automation in manufacturing and so on.So what resource do web giants exploit? This is the data they collect. This is the gold of the 21th century. The gold which smart people started extracting without asking any permission from anybody. The gold which is basically taken from YOU.Web 2.0 came after the original Web 1, a collection of static documents, hardly monetizable. Web 2.0 is the Internet of corporations and monopoly, which comes straight from the early stages of industrial revolution where huge corporations could control everything. This is the Internet of making as much money as possible and making use of as much data as possible. Due to being overly centralized it is vulnerable, manipulative, and prone to manipulation.Do we need a world where the data you own and produce can be turned against you because of greed or pure malice? It\u2019s not even about your privacy, it\u2019s about control. We hand control over the vast amounts of precious data over to companies and individuals who just happened to be at the right place at the right time. That sounds scary and irresponsible.So what is the alternative? We need some technical solution here, besides our desire to make things right. And we can see the shape that this solution could take now.Web3 concept was proposed at the end of the last century, with the major focus on so-called Semantic Web (the web where computers and humans basically have some common language somewhere between natural human language and computer code). But already then the idea of accountability, and distribution of control was proposed. Basically Web3 is the architecture which can\u2019t exist without decentralization of control.Only with emergence of blockchain the whole puzzle of Web3 came together. Blockchain is a paradigm shift that allows us to create systems which run \u201con their own\u201d, by the protocol agreed before their launch. We can construct decentralized systems which can become that layer on which you don\u2019t have to give up on control over your data, where all your data belongs to you.Web3 products are just emerging. But it\u2019s clear what the will and won\u2019t do. You will be able to explicitly allow access to your data. You won\u2019t need to trust third parties with storing your passwords. You won\u2019t let anybody erase your data either. Governments will finally understand that you can\u2019t solve all the problems by just banning things, you need to dig deeper and fight the root of the problem.Web3:Will let you control your data.Will be essentially decentralized.Will still be monetizable; but the monetization will be more transparent.Should (and hopefully will) be essentially unbreakable.Will be a consortium of different technologies merged through blockchain (or other decentralized tech, should it emerge)Web3 goes beyond Internet. This is a new paradigm of connected technologies (IoT, Big Data, Artificial Intelligence) which run on a decentralized layer, which brings them together and give them new synergistic meaning. It goes from technology to the structure of society, shaping and improving it.Web3 is the future that begins today.

Only a small part of what happens on the Internet is really just about value, and the paranoia that powers crypto culture doesn\u2019t account for all the dimensions of how people interact with technology and each other.So it\u2019s no surprise that non-crypto people find decentralized applications (dApps) sorely lacking. While technically interesting, their capabilities are typically specific to exposing blockchain-based value \u2014 and don\u2019t have much of makes the rest of the Web compelling.The question we should ask is, what would improve the Web beyond \u201cdecentralization\u201d? How do we want people to experience Web 3.0?Retracing our stepsA better way to imagine Web 3.0 is as a combination of the Web we have today \u2014 Web 2.0, with its network effects, propagation, and ecosystem of 4.2 billion users \u2014 with the quirkiness, innovation, and individuality that made Web 1.0 special. And that means drawing upon a lot of what we already know.The original magic of the Web is that it is linkable, allowing things to come together. Anything can be referenced: here\u2019s a web page, here\u2019s a transaction on Etherscan, here\u2019s proof that something has happened. People still rely on that URL, and that\u2019s a great quality to build upon.Of course, Web 1.0 was flat and static. We know what happened next: Web 2.0 giants made their fortunes by carving the Web into private interactive platforms. They fill these walled gardens with marvelous abstractions, turning data into premade units of interaction (\u201capps,\u201d \u201cfriends,\u201d \u201cstories\u201d) people already understand.The bargain is well understood: users are free to generate these objects, play with them and share them \u2014 as long as they remain within the silo. The tech giant claims the exclusive right to perform the coordination service, and the right to control its users\u2019 security, privacy, and identity.Network effects make it hard to escape. Not just for users, but for developers. In Web 2.0, development is extremely siloed. While there is sharing of open-source libraries, toolkits and frameworks, it\u2019s hard to share features, which reinforces the dominance of the tech giants.Web 3.0 is about correcting the problems of Web 2.0. But it would be a mistake to toss out Web 2.0\u2019s key ingredient: the user experience. People want the Web to feel more real, not less. We won\u2019t convince anyone that Web 3.0 means you now have to use a command line, and your ID is a 40-character hash. People want Web 3D: AR, VR, gamelike experiences \u2014 having physical objects, handling things, upgrading and interacting in a massively multiplayer way. That\u2019s something we can\u2019t ignore.How do we combine the best qualities from all of these perspectives? How do we build a Web that\u2019s linkable, referenceable, feels real and interactive, and leaves control with users?We don\u2019t need to start from scratch. There\u2019s a way to get there by reassembling the best parts of the Web we\u2019ve already built. Let me put it this way:If Web 1.0 was about links, and Web 2.0 was about objects within platforms, then Web 3.0 is about connections without intermediaries.The Web 3.0 data objectWeb objects are not neutral. In Web 2.0, an object\u2019s encoded attributes, like what platform it can run on, where it can or can\u2019t be shared, what it can link to, where the underlying data is saved, are all designed to reinforce the values of the tech giants. The boundaries of the walled garden are silently enforced by the shape and the physics of the object itself.The question becomes: what is the unit of interaction within Web 3.0? To break out of Web 2.0 siloes, we need to create richer relationships between objects, with minimal intermediation.Cardstack Project Update, November 2018We should think Web 3.0 as made of cards: universal objects representing content data, that may function alone, or come together with other cards in one workflow. They can be linked, addressed, referenced, embedded, saved, anywhere.Beneath the surface, each object is essentially a mini Web application. It contains its own styling information, with templates so that it can be rendered beautifully with animation, and it also has JavaScript or app logic, so it contains fields, constraints and permissions.Cardstack Project Update, November 2018The object maps to a data model, so that when you or anybody takes some kind of action, that gets recorded somewhere. Whether that data is persisted on a blockchain, a cloud service, or your computer, doesn\u2019t really matter. The objects behave the same.No matter where their underlying data is stored, these cards should be interoperable with other cards. They should be able to embed within each other or be composed together. They should be able to be shared, saved, and moved in and out of public and private spaces. These actions should feel as natural as manipulating an environment in a game.If we achieve this kind of interoperability and composability, then we no longer need to expect one app, or one platform, to \u201cdo it all,\u201d all the time. Instead, developers would be able to create small, highly focused modules of functionality, that could be shared, curated, and improved upon. For users, these cards, representing different tools and features, could be assembled into workflows as needed, or replaced with new cards just as easily.Imagine building a 2D website, then later inserting some 3D features with no extra backend work. Or creating a cloud-based workflow, then swapping out its underlying database with a distributed ledger.The point is, if we can design the physics of Web objects to be more natural and more open, then all sorts of things we can\u2019t do today \u2014 because we\u2019re locked into the rules of the tech giants \u2014 will suddenly become possible. And that will let us us build a radically different kind of world.I hope this piece provides a starting point to think about Web 3.0 from an experience perspective. But the exciting thing is putting it into practice. Since 2014 I\u2019ve been working on the open-source Cardstack Project, which is creating the Web 3.0 stack to support the creation of these objects.In my next article, I\u2019ll be getting more concrete and describe how we\u2019re building all of this, and how to make it work.Learn MoreFrom Speculation to Utility by Chris TseGrowing a Healthy Software Ecosystem by Lead Developer Ed FaulknerHow the Cardstack Framework Powers Decentralized ApplicationsThe Cardstack White Paperhttps://cardstack.com/Chris Tse (@christse) is a technologist and designer.

Why? For two types of reasons.First are the short-to-mid-term cost-efficiency gains that can arise from \u201cdistributing work\u201d. Peer-to-peer video streaming has already been around for some time, and can increase cost-efficiency of content delivery, in certain cases. It has even spawned a few novel businesses. Skype bootstrapped itself off p2p video-conferencing. Peer5 saves publisher\u2019s costs by making every video player a peer that adds up to a CDN. It turns out decentralisation can improve cost-efficiency in other layers of the video stack, too. For example, research from the Livepeer team anticipates GPU \u201cvideo miners\u201d can earn a significant income boost by doing transcoding services, while still charging an order of magnitude less than centralised providers.Second are the longer-term, societal improvements that the vision of Web3 brings along. Web3 is not about speed, performance, or convenience. It is about open, common infrastructure for applications that can deliver usability while not compromising on transparency, equality of rights and trustlessness.From capture to delivery, streaming video requires a complex thread of systems. As more foundational protocols go live throughout 2018, the build-out phase of infrastructure for video dApps approaches a maturing point. Autonomous media applications are likely years away from their \u201ciPhone moment\u201d. But the path to get there is becoming clearer.The protocol stackThe stack model is useful for developers to chart dependencies for a given application, avoiding the implementation of duplicate functionality. If a protocol provides a single feature reliably, the one above can leverage it, and focus on optimising something else.It\u2019s still early days for code that carries money around, though. Decentralized architectures are being devised by teams working, at the same time, on varied layers of an emergent stack.There has been some effort, lately, to map the current state of this stack. Most approach the issue from a generic perspective. We thought it\u2019d be useful to offer a depiction of the web3 stack as needed to support video applications, specifically. (For other diagrams of the generic \u201cweb3 stack\u201d, see the appendix\u00b9). Without further ado:A somewhat minimalist depiction of \u201cthe web3 video stack\u201d.1. NETWORKING + TRANSPORTWeb3 is being built on the same networking/transport stack we all know (TCP/IP). But it does represents a radical rethinking of the client-server model. In such, a client application communicates with small number of previously known services (a database server, perhaps a CDN network, or some third party service that tracks your cookies and serves ads) over a set of known protocols, that are chosen by the developers. In an open p2p network, an application typically communicates with peers that are not known in advance (i.e. need to be \u201cdiscovered\u201d), have varying quality (in terms of speed, reliability), and may use a variety of communication protocols. In web3, new libraries and APIs are needed to navigate such complexities.Libp2p is a networking suite that bundles building blocks (e.g. peer discovery, stream multiplexing, encryption, PubSub) into modules with common interfaces, while also allowing one to choose among multiple transports (TCP, WebRTC, WebSockets, UDP or others).Devp2p, Ethereum\u2019s native networking layer, eschews multi-transport support and modularity in favor of a simple implementation that meets the needs of server-run Ethereum nodes. The tradeoffs are that you can\u2019t get an Ethereum node running in a web browser talking to server-based Ethereum nodes over devp2p, but this is backed up by the assumption that browsers make poor Ethereum full nodes anyway, since they can\u2019t sync the chain.via GiphyWebRTC is worth a mention. Its transport protocol and libraries give web browsers and mobile apps the powers of peer-to-peer real-time communication, allowing for video streaming directly from browser to browser. With webRTC, not only dedicated apps, but also also in-browser applications (e.g. web sites) can be first-class citizens in a p2p network. It is already used by companies such as Peer5 to accelerate existing CDN solutions.2. STATE MACHINE + CONSENSUSDecentralized applications need a common ledger to read/write relevant state changes, together with a mechanism to ensure consensus on the order and validity of transactions. This is especially the case when it comes to services provided by networks of competing agents, where fraud proofs, dispute resolution, accounting or settlement are ultimately done on chain.There are notable tradeoffs at this level. With only a few thousand daily users of dApps across all smart contract platforms combined, it\u2019s still very early to point to any \u201cwinning\u201d platform.The EVM and ethereum (which are leveraged by Livepeer, Paratii, PopChest);Rootstock + Bitcoin (Flixxo\u2019s heading this way);Steem (Viewly, DTube, DLive);EOS;Worth noting, the blockchains cited above don\u2019t currently scale well. Layer 2 scaling solutions are hereby treated as an extension to this layer, and explored more thoroughly in the appendix\u00b2.3. ORIGIN SERVICESIn industry there\u2019s a layer referred to as video \u201corigin services\u201d \u2014 ingesting, processing, and seeding the content to a CDN. Often times a piece of software called a media server provides all these. A media server has all of the video specific application knowledge that makes streaming video different from delivering other types of static content over the internet:How to ingest live video as it is being streamed into the server over potentially different protocols;How to encode the video into the required outputs (more below in \u201cVideo Processing\u201d);How to serve the video out to different device types or content delivery networks that request it via different delivery formats;Any additional video specific features like closed captioning support, DVR services, analytics, ad insertion, image detection, etc.Ingesting footage \u2014 an artistic representation (via Giphy)The basis for this functionality is an open source media server that can be distributed to any node on a network. For such network to be truly robust at origin services, location matters, as proximity to a broadcaster can make a tremendous difference in stream quality, and reduce buffering. Ideally, a protocol can incentivize the running of these nodes across different regions, for broadcasters and streamers over the world to have high performance and low latency.Red5 Media Server (open source media server not focused on decentralized use cases);LPMS (Livepeer media server, can be used standalone or in a decentralized node).4. VIDEO PROCESSING\u201cProcessing\u201d is a generic term for a set of jobs very specific to the realm of A/V streaming. Transcoding, included there along with transrating and transmuxing, is the computationally heavy step in a video pipeline. In human terms, the purpose of transcoding is to take the input video stream from a phone, camera, or laptop, and convert it into all the formats and bitrates necessary to reach every device on the planet, at every connection speed.Most open transcoding solutions, like ffmpeg, are very low level, requiring significant engineering to scale into production systems. Most commercial transcoding services are closed source, proprietary, and expensive.By leveraging decentralization of compute resources, and cryptoeconomically incentivized protocols, it\u2019s possible to create a network with the convenience and scalability of cloud transcoding services, but the cost profile of running on bare metal hardware. This would allow anyone to send video into the network to be transcoded, and for its nodes to compete in processing the video into all the required outputs, for barely more than the cost of electricity.A key feature to enable, here, is Adaptive Bitrate Streaming (ABS)\u00b3. By converting one stream into a number of different bitrates, proper transcoding allows smart video players to switch between different versions of the video depending upon the available bandwidth and connection speed. When you notice your Netflix or Youtube video quality increase or decrease automatically as you\u2019re watching, this is often an example of ABS in action. Without ABS, you leave viewership on the table, as users with slower connections simply can not access the original stream at high quality.Livepeer (protocol for incentivized transcoding for live streams and video on demand built on Ethereum);VideoCoin (blockchain that supports encoding transaction types).5. STORAGEAt this point, differences between live streaming and video-on-demand accentuate. Live only needs to care about the source of the stream being broadcast, in principle. VoD apps need somewhere (or some unique identifier) to fetch files from \u2014 \u201cthe hard drive\u201ds of web3.Peer-to-peer storage\u2019s public perception have swung violently in recent past. Going from the \u201clet\u2019s recycle all the unused disk space in the world\u201d frenzy of a couple years ago to the realisation that \u201cAWS & co. are just really, really cheap and hard to compete against\u201d, even for the average \u201cunder-construction\u201d dApp. The advantages of p2p storage come in place when one needs true uncensorability, and doesn\u2019t need the ability to erase files or that of handling granular access permissions.Today, developers can store videos on a range of p2p file systems. The differences in the networks below come down to how privacy is handled; how prices are determined; the way proofs are structured; and else. These are all working, yet none has got their native incentives in fully functional mode.IPFS (uniquely addressed chunks, differently than torrent files, making for a more \u201cgranular market\u201d; block-level deduplication; ability to set up clusters; and\u2026);Filecoin (\u2026 a native incentive system, which is not live yet. Interestingly enough, both are decoupled, and the first can exist without the second);Swarm (Ethereum\u2019s original native storage system);Storj (emphasis on end-to-end encryption and security);Sia (similar to the above, has recently put forth a tutorial on streaming).Decentralised Storage Networks are complemented/extended by technologies that provide access control, and allow applications to enforce permissions (e.g. DRM or pay-per-view schemes). Unlock is an example of a project working on this matter.6. DELIVERYContent delivery is handled by CDNs like Akamai, Cloudfront, and Fastly. They\u2019ve built up networks of servers placed crucially at edge locations around the world, and infrastructure to distribute videos to these during times of demand. These companies charge broadcasters by the Gigabyte of data delivered. So, as more viewers watch content, the delivery charges go up.Recently, peer to peer technology has been disruptive here. Companies like Peer5 and Streamroot can offset up to 85% of the traffic (and cost) during peak events like the World Cup. While this is a big improvement, it still requires a traditional CDN to handle the remaining 15\u201350% of the traffic.Both these CDNs and \u201cP2P accelerators\u201d are operating as centralized companies that charge for bandwidth. Protocols like Bittorrent, and its web based implementation, WebTorrent, replace pay-for-bandwidth with tit-for-tat bandwidth accounting, where viewers provide bandwidth in exchange for content. This works reasonably well for popular on-demand content, but suffers for low-latency cases (like live streaming), and long tail content.Projects who are attempting to decentralize CDNs for both general purpose file delivery, and video streaming (live + on demand), have the uphill battle of incentivizing guaranteed file availability, performance, and delivery, on a global p2p network. While Swarm and IPFS/Filecoin have made great progress on the on-demand use case, in which an entire file is requested to be downloaded before playback, for streaming and live use cases there\u2019s still a missing layer in the stack: an origin point for serving live content alongside decentralized p2p content accelerators.BitTorrent (the original, permissionless content-addressed delivery network);JoyStream (paid seeding for Bittorrent);Filecoin (could theoretically serve as an origin point for VOD content, but unclear about live content);Swarm (Ethereum\u2019s web3 infrastructure project with a working group track for streaming);Theta Labs (video blockchain with PoW certificates that are used to pay for bandwidth).7. INDEXINGWeb3 needs solutions for indexing and query optimisation \u2014 equivalent to the built-in indexing functionality of DB systems like postgres or mongodb, or standalone solutions such as Solr/Lucene. The EVM implementations come already with a primitive indexing system based on events, but it\u2019s certainly not enough for, say, full-text search in large data sets on IPFS or Swarm.In the context of dApps, it\u2019s been common practice for teams to build their own indexing servers based on classic technology. Blockchain explorers such as etherscan.io or etherchain.org are typical examples - they pull data from Ethereum, store it in a database, and expose it over an API.These solutions effectively reintroduce the defects of centralized technology web3 is meant to overcome. In particular, the need to trust a 3rd party to not censor, or falsely represent your data. We need decentralized indexing solutions that provide results that are provably correct.Proving correctness of query results consists of two parts: the results must all be actually in the original data set, and they must be complete (no results omitted). Proving correctness is relatively easy: for example, if the data are stored in a Merkle tree, each individual result comes with a Merkle proof of its existence in the tree. Proving completeness is another story.The Graph (OS indexing engine for Ethereum and IPFS, evolving into a distributed query protocol);Fluence (database network focused on querying);TxHash.com (contract tracking / indexing as a service);Supermax (contract tracking / indexing as a service);Cleargraph (GraphQL ethereum index, also offers indexing as a service);BigchainDB (\u201cdecentralized database\u201d).8. RELEVANCE / REPUTATIONOn today\u2019s web, relevance engines (assessing the \u201cvalue\u201d of content in a given context) and reputation systems (assessing the \u201cvalue\u201d of users) are generally closed source and under constant change. For reference, see the weird phenomena arising from YouTube\u2019s recommendation algorithms.Excessive moderation suffocates public online environments; loose moderation allows for toxicity to spread. Video platforms of all kinds strive to find a balance in between.There is a wide range of \u201ccuration tasks\u201d one must be supplied with: maintaining generic white-or-black-lists; organizing these into feeds; filtering comments; providing context-specific recommendations.Scaling content moderation.Scaling these activities involves hard tradeoffs, even on centralized systems. Facebook outsources most of its curation to underpaid workers in the Philippines; YouTube has reportedly just hired some thousands of moderators after polemics with their live streaming feature.There\u2019s no go-to solution for dApp developers to filter the content they stream. It\u2019s unclear what kind of (crypto-economic?) mechanisms are suitable for the tasks at hand. It seems natural, though, that incentivizing an unbounded network of curators and offering easy pluggability to upper-level applications is the way to go. Distributed curation design patterns are frequently criticised for not taking reputation and sybil-resistance into account \u2014 their intertwining is our reason for grouping both here.Steem (has a curation protocol built-in its blockchain);TCRs (a promising design pattern that deserves some testing before being taken as an actual primitive);Relevant (still focused on building distributed curation work for its flagship application, in the realm of social news);Paratii (idem, for videos and playlists).9. APPLICATIONApparently, no shortage of attempts to build \u201cthe decentralized YouTube\u201d.Applications tie access to the relevant protocols below them, and present an experience to end-users in the form of interface plus logic.The immaturity of the space makes it tempting for app developers to swallow all challenges ahead, and build some functionality that could be outsourced to another protocol. Also, go-to-market strategizing implies lower-level protocols cannot launch in isolation \u2014 most of them deploy at least an initial implementation to prove technical relevance and attract developers. Examples are Livepeer, Theta, and Videocoin, launching with Livepeer.tv, SLIVER.tv, and Live Planet, respectively.A list and mapping of video-oriented applications in the space can be found here (dated Q4 2017):The State of Decentralised Video Q4 2017Tubes and Flixes will never be the same. Here\u2019s why.medium.comApplication developers owe a lot to libraries and frameworks that make their processes easier. These can significantly speed up the journey of getting a dApp to production, facilitating the management of keys, connection to nodes, importing/exporting wallets, etc:Embark;Web3.JS;EtherJS.\ud83d\udcdd Final NotesWeb3 isn\u2019t a fixed future, more than it is a chance to reform pieces of the internet. There\u2019s no definite depiction of its stack. We tried to offer a useful mental model, while deliberately keeping it simple. It may help developers starting to build video dApps, product teams looking to \u201coutsource part of their video pipeline\u201d, or analysts familiarising themselves with the space.Worth remembering, decentralisation is not an end in itself. Neither it is binary. A little decentralisation can go a long way. Compare how much better the online experience became when we \u201csuddenly\u201d had four major browsers instead of just one.The goal of web3 shouldn\u2019t be to replace specific incumbents, but rather ensure that developers have access to tooling & infrastructure for applications that don\u2019t depend on monopolistic agents to operate. This exercise was made not to speculate on which layers are more likely to accrue value, but mostly to shine light on those where there are still big gaps to fill. The ecosystem will thrive as fast as its capacity to coordinate efforts.The diagrams and descriptions above are non-exhaustive, and certainly deserve critique. Please shout back your feedback.\ud83c\udfac Appendix\u00b9 - Previous depictions of the web3 stackSome great thinkers in the space have previously tinkered with depictions of the web3 stack, mostly from a generic (as opposed to industry-specific) perspective. A few recommended reads are Stephan Tual\u2019s \u201cWeb 3.0 Revisited\u201d, BigChainDB\u2019s \u201cBlockchain Infrastructure Framing: A First Principles Framing\u201d, and Kyle Samani\u2019s \u201cThe Web3 Stack\u201d.The Web3 Foundation, whose mission is to steward technologies and applications in the fields of decentralized web software protocols, has a comprehensive wiki where one can dive into individual pieces of a generalised stack:\u00b2 - Layer 2Blockchains are referred to as the \u201cbase-layer\u201d for this novel breed of applications, even though, technically, there\u2019s much more underneath. Layer 2 is a term for scaling solutions that relieve the root chain by trying to use it as \u201ca last resource\u201d when it comes to settling economic interactions, as much as possible.Layer 2 scaling comes in the form of design patterns, standard implementations and even service providers, extending blockchain protocols without touching their core features. Value capture at this level is still a pretty much open question: are all \u201ccore components\u201d of a blockchain ultimately meant to be free and standardised? Do inherent tradeoffs mean we are heading towards scalability as a service? Are relayer-like entities going to play a pivotal role here? Note most efforts below are not production-ready.Plasma Chains / Cash (Loom Network, OmiseGO, Bankex);Sharding (Prysmatic Labs, Drops of Diamond, Status, PegaSys are all pursuing different approaches \u2014 e.g. mobile-oriented and enterprise-oriented, for the last two);State / payment channels (SpankChain, FunFair; Perun; L4; Machinomy provides a micropayments SDK; Connext is piloting a program to set up & access state channel hubs);Off-chain verified computation (TrueBit; Oraclize; Intel SGX).\u00b3 - ABSAdaptive Bitrate Streaming can be seen as an extension to the processing layer. ABS is a need, in practice, for most end-user, real-world applications. It consists of constantly optimising content delivery, throughout a stream, to get a device the best possible bitrate for its connection, at every given moment. Of course, this also implies proper work has been done at the encoding level. That\u2019s just the surface of what eventually became a very complicated science.The challenge grows when there\u2019s no central place to get all these bitrates from, but rather a heterogeneous mesh where some of your peers may have the same file in very different formats. The ideal bitrate does not depend solely on you (e.g. speed of connection), but on the speeds and availabilities of peers nearby.Written with Doug Petkanics and Jelle Gerbrandy.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Ethereum", "Cryptocurrency", "Streaming", "Token Economy"]}, {"title": "An Overview of Relevant Metrics in Web 3.0", "post_link": "https://medium.com/fabric-ventures/an-overview-of-relevant-metrics-in-web-3-0-b213f7e641ac?source=search_post", "author_name": "Max Mersch", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@MaxMersch", "publish_date": "2019-07-09", "last_modified_date": "2019-07-09", "readtime": "7.10", "claps": 430, "voters": 45, "content": "An Overview of Relevant Metrics in Web 3.0A high level overview of the Metrics we are tracking in Web 3.0 Networks from Bitcoin & Ethereum to MakerDAO and Beyond.Max MerschFollowJul 9 \u00b7 8 min readFollowing up on our post on what business models and revenue flows might arise from Web 3.0 we started thinking about how we might value and monitor such business models. Having worked through an aggregate of seven VC funds, we have no doubts about the importance that key metrics play in venture investing when evaluating the performance of a company:\u201cWhat\u2019s the current MRR growth?\u201d\u201cWhat churn do you have across different cohorts of customers?\u201d\u201cHow many DAUs do you have?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s your net contribution margin per customer?\u201dThese are all metrics that measured very important aspects of Web 2.0 business models, but they do not apply to all Web 3.0 business models. Trying to forcefully apply them will not bring any results \u2014 just like one would not evaluate a lender by their number of \u201cdaily active mortgage users\u201d, one shouldn\u2019t analyse the healthiness of the MakerDAO ecosystem by its number of daily user interactions. Equally, MRR growth rates and churn rates don\u2019t make sense to calculate when there is no central company making these revenues.As investors in the Web 3.0 space, we have refined different types of metrics we use to evaluate networks based on their specific use cases and business models. From hash-rate, to gas usage, to value locked, this post will dive into some of the Web 3.0 native metrics.BitcoinThe premier Proof of Work native asset, mainly used as a store of valueHash-rate: the hash-rate of the Bitcoin network is the aggregate work put into the system by all the miners and hence is a representation of the network\u2019s security. With the probabilistic finality of Bitcoin, any set of actors with 51% of the hash-rate can create the longest chain around which consensus forms: a higher hash-rate implies a higher difficulty to attack the network.Number of miners controlling 51% of hash-rate: indicating the degree of centralisation of the network around certain miners & mining pools. The lower the number, the higher the risk of collusion for an attack on the network.Number of transactions: can be used to represent the usage of the network as a means of exchange, but not to adequately represent the usage of the network as a store of value. Can be gamed by a set of bots spamming a high number of low value transactions, and can be a misrepresentation as one transaction can encode many transfers via batching or sidechains / Lightning Network.Aggregate transaction value: the aggregate value of all transactions within a certain time period, showing the value transferred over the network.Total market capitalisation: as a store of value, the total market capitalisation of Bitcoin matters as a representation of the amount of value it is entrusted with (with a caveat that some Bitcoins are lost or dormant).Block rewards available to miners: main source of revenue for the miners securing the network. The block reward multiplied by the price of Bitcoin represent the value available in exchange for hash-power.Transaction fees paid to miners: source of revenue for miners that should increase in importance as the block rewards continue halving. Expected to become the primary source of revenues for miners securing the network in the coming decades.Bitcoin hash-rate has recently reached an all time high \u2014 Source: https://www.blockchain.com/en/charts/hash-rate?timespan=3yearsLightning NetworkBitcoin\u2019s Layer 2 scaling solution (written by Jeremy Welch from Casa)Network Capacity: The total number of Bitcoins committed to the Lightning Network. Because channel transactions are completely private, this metric is the main indicator of how much wealth is being transferred on the system.Number of nodes with active channels: Total number of Nodes indicates how many peers are actively trading on the Lightning Network, and also routing funds for other nodes on the network.Number of payment channels: Total number of channels indicates how many direct node-to-node connections have been created. An increase in Nodes should also see an increase in channels, and as the number of use cases for Lightning Network grows, the rate of channel growth should increase faster than total nodes.Average Channels per Node: This will likely increase as more use cases for Lightning emerge, then might decrease as the network density increases (and the ability to route via other nodes instead of direct becomes easier)Number of Tor Onion Service Nodes: By default Lightning connection codes include the IP address and port of the Node. IP address can then be used to determine the physical location of nodes which is a major OpSec risk. Using Tor Onion Service, it is now possible to connect without revealing physical location.Lightning Network total capacity and highest capacity nodes \u2014 Source: https://explore.casa/EthereumThe largest smart contract platform for application developersCan be measured by some of the same metrics as Bitcoin around hash-rate and transactions, but includes many more:Total gas usage: a metric that represents both the number of transactions / smart contracts used and the complexity of the smart contracts being used. Used to illustrate the total usage of the Ethereum network as a decentralised computation platform (with the caveat that transaction spamming can skew this metric heavily).Average gas usage per transaction: illustrating the complexity of smart contracts / computations used on the Ethereum network.Average gas price: dependent on the number of transactions at a given point in time\u2014 representing the usage and congestion of the Ethereum network.Value locked up in DeFi: for the current core set of applications built on Ethereum in the Decentralised Finance space (DeFi), ETH is the main source of collateral being used. The amount of value locked in DeFi represents the usage of DeFi applications and positively influences the price of Ethereum (less liquid supply). Largely dominated by MakerDAO, but with traction from Compound, Uniswap, Dharma and Synthetix amongst others.Number of developers using Truffle/Ganache/Zeppelin: as a smart contract platform, the number of developers working on Ethereum based applications is one of the most important metrics to track. The best quantifiable proxy could be the number of Truffle/Ganache/Zeppelin users (developer environments and libraries), while keeping in mind that every download does not equate an additional user / active developer.Around 2% of all ETH is currently locked in the DeFi ecosystem \u2014 Source: https://defipulse.com/MakerDAO & DAIThe largest decentralised stable coin & lending platformTotal value of loans issued: representing the total usage of the MakerDAO platform, comparable to other Web 2.0 lending providers.Number of open CDPs: as a proxy for the total number of users of the platform, considering that an open CDP is the closest approximation to an \u201cactive user\u201d of MakerDAO.Value of stability fee: derived from the stability fee (currently 16.5% annually) and the total value of loans outstanding, the value of stability fee is burnt in MKR, leading to a theoretic increase in value of MKR tokens (lower supply).Collateralised value: the value of all assets (currently only ETH) locked up in CDPs as collateral for outstanding loans.Collateralisation ratio: the ratio between total value locked up in CDPs and the value of outstanding loans, representing the risk rate of the overall system (CDPs that reach below 150% are automatically liquidated).Default rate of CDPs: percentage of CDPs that fall below 150% collateralisation \u2014 used to evaluate the optimal stability fee and collateralisation ratio required.MKR voting participation: involvement from the MKR holder community in governance decisions around stability fee increases. For a token that largely bases its value on its governance features, this will become a useful metric to track in the future.DAI stability/peg: the result of the market incentives set by the MakerDAO system to keep the supply and demand of DAI in similar ranges. Can be moved by increasing or decreasing the stability fee, and with the future Daily Savings Rate.Steady growth of total collateral in MakerDAO, reaching $450m \u2014 Source: https://defipulse.com/makerWork TokensSupply-side coordinating tokens such as Keep, Augur or LivepeerStaking participation rate: a metric that tracks how many token holders are active within the economy of the network. Networks aiming to get above a certain threshold of participation can increase their block rewards whenever staking participation rate dips below a certain threshold (e.g. Livepeer increasing its inflation daily until it reaches 50% active participation).Staking yield from block rewards: the yield provided to the active participants of the network, acting as a rebalancing method from passive holders to active holders. In a network with a token purely used to incentivise the supply side, the passive holder is not value additive and as a result should be diluted.Work activity: the amount of work being done on a given network: securing Keeps on Keep Network, resolving markets on Augur or transcoding videos on Livepeer. This metric shows the real usage of the network and is currently still very low or nonexistent in most networks as they are just getting started & launchingAggregate revenue flows to validators: the value of fees paid by users of the network to work providers of the network. The aggregate value paid for securing keeps in Keep, resolving markets in Augur and transcoding video in Livepeer. This should be the most important metric when valuing a network \u2014 by performing a discounted future cash flow analysis of these revenue flows aggregated across all validators one can assign a fair & rational value to holding these tokens whose sole purpose is granting the right to perform profitable work.Livepeer Staking Participation Rate reaching closer to target 50%\u2014 Source: https://www.scout.cool/livepeer/mainnetAll these metrics come with different caveats and restrictions \u2014 they do not tell a clear story by themselves, but they do give a good indication of the direction a certain network is growing into.This post serves as a high level introduction to quantifiable metrics we believe everybody should be tracking, and we look forward to the development of both the networks and the metrics that accompany them.With thanks to Jeremy Welch and Nic Carter for their insights, contributions and corrections.Written in collaboration with the whole team at Fabric Ventures, with numerous corrections from Julien Th\u00e9venard.", "responses": 1, "tags": ["Bitcoin", "Cryptocurrency", "Web3", "Blockchain", "Ethereum"]}, {"title": "Decentralized Exchanges Workshop Outcomes", "post_link": "https://medium.com/web3foundation/decentralized-exchanges-workshop-outcomes-4753dbd86f2b?source=search_post", "author_name": "Web3 Foundation Team", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@web3", "publish_date": "2018-02-08", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-13", "readtime": "9.06", "claps": 279, "voters": 35, "content": "Decentralized Exchanges Workshop OutcomesWeb3 Foundation TeamFollowFeb 8, 2018 \u00b7 10 min readQuick links: DEX projects breakdown spreadsheet, video from the DEX meetup.As part of our mission to decentralize the web, the Web3 Foundation will act as an advocate, steward and supporter of decentralized protocols and projects \u2014 particularly those that utilize blockchain technology.This year, we plan to roll out a series of workshops designed to create collaboration across specific blockchain initiatives including: decentralized exchanges, scalability and on-chain governance.The goal of these workshops is to bring together highly technical teams and to develop a shared understanding of some of the larger ecosystem initiatives necessary for the deployment of highly functional and consumer-ready decentralized software. Where crossover and industry-wide issues are found, the Web3 Foundation will seek to deploy capital and resources for research and development initiatives to address those greater ecosystem issues. Please get in touch with us on twitter at @web3foundation or by email at hello@web3.foundation if you would like to get involved in any of the topics touched in the article or want more information.The DEX WorkshopOur first workshop focused on decentralized exchanges (DEXs). We think supporting the growth of decentralized exchanges is critically important at this time. We\u2019ve seen a massive influx of interest in cryptocurrency in the past year, and have seen the stress it has put on centralized exchanges. Until recently, centralized exchanges have typically provided better user experiences \u2014 from UX design to order book fulfillment to centralized 24/7 customer support.Michael Oved of AirSwap presents at the Web3 DEX Meetup in BerlinWith technology and cryptocurrency adoption progressing \u2014 we\u2019ve also seen the promise of DEXs to deliver on a similar user experience. Now is the time to ensure that a fully decentralized trading ecosystem becomes a reality.We invited a number of technical teams to join us in our Berlin offices on January 23rd for a full day workshop around the following topics:front running preventionorder book unlinkabilitythroughputdark poolscross chain exchanges.Joining us were devs working on: 0x, Airswap, Augur, Gnosis, Herdius, Kyber, Melonport, OmiseGo, and Radar Relay as well as a number of other devs working on specs and DEX support initiatives.On the following day we organised a community meetup, where a few of the teams were able to speak about decentralized exchanges in general and their projects, you can see the Meetup video here.In order to make it easier to understand other projects and make the discussion more structured the participants proposed a number of different categories that each project should cover:1. Order Book: On or off chain? Is there even a single order book?2. Provably Fair Matching: Is it necessary to trust a third party to match the orders fairly?3. Order placement: Does the way orders are placed make front running easy?4. Throughput: How many orders can it process? How much volume can it process?5. Latency: How long does it take to settle trades?6. Cost: How much does it cost to conduct an exchange?7. Privacy: Do the participant identities get revealed? Are orders linkable?8. Legal: What legal considerations have you taken? Do you perform KYC on the users?9. Target users: What set of users is your exchange targeting? Is it aimed at low liquidity niche tokens or high liquidity popular markets?10. Assets: What is the universe of assets tradable on the exchange?11. Worst case failure: Given a failure of security assumptions, what is the worst that can happen?12. Development stage: Is the project live? When will it be deployed and usable?13. Greatest challenges: Which element of working on the exchange has been the most challenging?We then followed on to discussing each of the projects and trying to understand how they fit together. We hope that this common understanding of how these projects relate to each other will help them realise ways to collaborate or find their market niche. You can see the summary of our analysis in the breakdown spreadsheet.From the overview of the projects it is clear that exchanges can decentralize two aspects of their operation: custody and matching. Maintaining custody of the assets while trading is a great mitigation strategy for many exchange related risks and costs. Trust-free matching can have the same effect. Some exchanges attempt to do both, while others only one, avoiding many pitfalls of decentralised matching. Maintaining custody while still matching on chain may be also beneficial, avoiding any DEX implementation issues.After looking at the particular projects we identified the main issues that would be worth discussing: front running, scaling, ongoing vs batch auction, privacy, liquidity and legal. Below are the general outcomes of different discussions.Front RunningInformational advantage that is exploitable by a mechanism arbitrage, that is exploitable by a mechanical arbitrage, that leads to another market participant receiving a worse economic price than would have otherwise occurred.Possible ways to get front ran:getting a front by other market participantsgetting a front ran by a miner (participant with transaction ordering capabilities)In traditional exchanges front running is limited by a trusted party that collects the orders. This kind of trusted ordering can be also used for decentralised exchanges, given reputation of the matcher and maintaining custody over funds.To make it impossible to for other participants who are able to order the transactions not to be able to order them in an unfair way, the orders have to be concealed. After the ordering is determined the orders get revealed. This can be achieved using a commit/reveal scheme or in order not to rely on the reveal phase using a distributed key store. Both Gnosis and Parity (Parity Secret Store) have been working on a distributed key generation, storage and reveal implementation. A threshold signature is used and to break this scheme multiple key servers would need to collude.Sometimes just seeing that there is an order is enough to gain some information about other market participants, in this case a Submarine send scheme can be used.Ongoing vs BatchThe only project focused on creating an exchange based on batch auctions was Gnosis. Batch auctions are a departure from how a traditional exchange works, however have many benefits in context of blockchain \u2014 specifically make front running less of a problem. General agreement was that they can be good for markets with guaranteed minimum liquidity and when the price is not too volatile.More about the Gnosis Dutch exchange.ScalingThe goal is to increase the exchange throughput at reasonable costs.Ethereum Researcher, Vlad Zamfir, speaks to attendees at W3F DEX MeetingIn general scaling solutions for decentralised exchanges can be categorised into changes to the underlying protocol and changes to the exchange application itself. Exchange application can be modified by introducing batching, faster signature schemes and optimising the matching algorithm.The most generic way for increasing the throughput is to improve the throughput of the underlying state machine. There is a number of solutions under development which aim at lowering costs and increasing throughput, some of the mentioned ones: Polkadot, Cosmos / Ethermint, Plasma and Raiden. Many more solutions are in development.One perspective on scalability was provided by Melonport which focuses on asset management on the blockchain. They decided to build Melonchain, a stand alone chain which will be bridged to the Ethereum mainnet. To use a token across chains a token contract has to be duplicated on the 2nd chain with an additional `mint(\u2026)` function. To move the tokens Parity Bridge can be used. They have a plan to convert into a Polkadot parachain down the road. A useful initiative that can be taken on is to set a standard for cross chain tokens.In order for those solutions to fit the requirements of applications and align timelines it is useful for the application builders to remain in touch with scalability solutions builders. Since not many of those solutions are productions ready it is important to keep the exchange application protocol abstract to be then able to adjust to changes in the underlying technology.In order to facilitate communication between application and protocol builders the Foundation will steward an initiative we\u2019re calling ScalingNOW! We will work in collaboration with Giveth to bring focus to scalability solutions that can be implemented within a 3\u20136 month timeframe. Here is the current framework:Giveth will run a series of interviews with devs working on scaling solutions. You can check out those videos here: ScalingNOW interviewsWeb3 Foundation and Giveth invite you to join the conversation around scaling at our Riot channel, which is open to all.Web3 Foundation will organize a small working group in Barcelona this March to bring together DApp developers and those working on scaling solutions. As with this blog post, we\u2019ll make the findings available to the community.Web3 Foundation will organize a large scale conference in mid/late 2018 focusing on scaling solutions, both near and long term. This will be open to the community and we\u2019ll share more details as we get further along organizing. If you\u2019d like to be involved, please shoot us a note: hello@web3.foundation.PrivacyTrade/participant indistinguishability. There are 3 main approaches:zkSNARKs are not usable for decentralised exchanges because one loses the ability to prove the message sender. There is also too much computational overhead involved.Ring signatures which are already implemented for EVM, based on this paper.Set accumulators. They appear to be doable in Solidity and Matthew di Ferrante is working on it. More information about cryptographic accumulators can be found here.LiquidityAs new exchanges are created often they lack liquidity to be used. Either there is not enough funds to provide sufficient liquidity or the exchange is not able to provide liquidity for legal reasons. Any risks associated with providing liquidity are similar to centralised markets. Automated or designated market makers can provide base liquidity, research and partnerships with those is useful. Potential solutions for improving liquidity is to partner with centralized exchanges or allow pooling of liquidity across decentralised exchanges.Working Group at W3F DEX MeetupHerdius proposes that in addition to working with centralized exchanges DEXs should also work together on sharing liquidity between each other. One potential solution to this is to set up an intra DEX settlement network / system that can match trade orders across the different decentralized exchanges utilizing it. DEXs could subsidize cross-DEX trade order by taking a cut from their share of the fees. In this case scenario the user would not pay a cost overhead for their transaction. Through this network even the borrowing and lending of liquidity becomes possible between different DEXs.LegalDecentralized exchanges face a significant amount of legal scrutiny similar to their centralised counterparts. Every jurisdiction has a different set of rules, which make it hard to operate a globally accessible exchange. Many of the projects focus only on open source development and there are questions as to who should be the regulated parties in the ecosystem.Ideally, DEXs will utilize cross-project legal advice in order to avoid duplicating their efforts. While there are some risks associated with shared legal findings, a number of projects expressed their interest in collaborating on a knowledge-base and in funding legal analyses. One organisation that has been working on these questions is COALA, and projects should be aware of their work in this area. Web3 Foundation will work on information sharing initiatives and further legal discussions in the space.In terms of jurisdictions, Gibraltar, which recently released the Gibraltar DLT regulation (similar to the BitLicense in NY) appears to be a business-friendly option. Under current German regulation DEXs that only do crypto to crypto trades do not fall under any current regulation. However, if in the future cryptocurrencies and tokens are deemed as financial instruments under EU law, a licence will more than likely be required.Another vital area of focus is the verification of supported digital assets as non-securities, which some exchanges manually verify, one token at a time to ensure compliance with national and international regulations. One initiative that may reduce this overhead would be to create and maintain a shared list of digital assets determined to be non-security tokens, and to fund this analysis through a consortium.Continued WorkMany other discussions happened in smaller groups and we hope that they had a valuable outcome.In addition to the educational value of the projects identified above, we hope that the following initiatives will also help to accelerate this application:ScalingNOW workshop and gathering focused on immediate scalability solutions. Join the ScalingNOW Riot channel and see the ScalingNOW interviews organised by Giveth.Organise a general Blockchain Scalability conference.Standardising cross chain token standard and wrapped ETH <> ETH equivalence.Supporting research on set accumulators for privacy.Aggregation of high level-legal findings of different projects and creation of a shared knowledge base.Shared list of non-security tokens, which require less regulatory oversight when being traded.Coordinate a framework for liquidity pooling across decentralized exchanges.Thank you to all of the projects and individuals that participated in these events. We look forward to continuing the discussion on identified topics and to organising follow-up workshops and meetups.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Web3", "Polkadot", "Decentralization", "Ethereum"]}, {"title": "Gitcoin Launches to Push Open Source Forward for the Web3 Generation", "post_link": "https://medium.com/gitcoin/pushing-open-source-forward-for-the-web3-generation-26a5726902ea?source=search_post", "author_name": "Kevin Owocki", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@owocki", "publish_date": "2017-09-25", "last_modified_date": "2018-05-22", "readtime": "2.87", "claps": 164, "voters": 35, "content": "Gitcoin Launches to Push Open Source Forward for the Web3 GenerationKevin OwockiFollowSep 25, 2017 \u00b7 3 min readOpen Source Software is the foundation of millions of careers in software development. For developers, myself included, who have built careers on python, javascript, HTML5, Ubuntu, and countless other Open Source technologies, its easy to forget that it wasn\u2019t always this way.The Journey Thus FarBefore the advent of distributed version control systems like Git in 2005, Open Source was a fringe phenomenon. The launch of Github, several years after Git become a standard, further pushed open source forward by making it easy for developers to share ideas, get feedback, and distribute their code. Today, Github has 5.8 million active users, 331k active organizations, and enabled 815k new users to make their first pull request in 2016 alone.In a way, Open Source principles have always been a part of the scientific community, and the principle of sharing ideas pre-dates the open source movement. But the speed, non-linearity, and connectedness of the Web 2.0 world has led to unprecedented breakthroughs in geographically distribute communities creating value together \u2014 from the invention and subsequent standardization of TCP/IP to the distributed Astrobiology project SETI@home, to the open source financial tool Bitcoin.The Path AheadAs far as Open Source has come, there is still a disconnect between the _value_ that the open source ecosystem provides to the modern economy, and the compensation provided to developers for that impact. The Oracle\u2019s and Red Hat\u2019s of the world have built successful businesses built upon open source, but the small and mid-caps of the world have not yet unbundled those business models.The launch of Ethereum and the smart contract infrastructure built upon it has the potential to change all that. By tokenizing value and making it programmatically easy and secure to exchange value, there exists an opportunity to push open source forward with borderless, secure, easy payments.Enter Gitcoin.Gitcoin Core is a team of developers that believes each of the follow actors in the Open Source ecosystem have a lot to gain by removing middlemen, creating new opportunities, and introducing efficiencies into their workflow:So what exactly is Gitcoin? Gitcoin is a distributed network of Smart Contracts, based upon Ethereum that enables:Job Hunters to find work, and perhaps more importantly, to try out working together before they commit.Open Source Contributors to make a living wage off of their work in open source.Repo Maintainers to galvanize an always-on, globalized, network of peers.By facilitating the transfer of value through this ecosystem, Gitcoin solves for the inefficiencies in this triple-sided market:Gitcoin is based upon Ethereum, which means that it\u2019s free, fair, and open forever. By eliminating recruiters and other middle, Gitcoin allows software engineers to focus on what they love \u2014 building things.At the center of it all is the Gitcoin Bounty Explorer. The Bounty Explorer is an index of all of the funded tasks available immediately worldwide. Here is what it looks like (and hey, there\u2019s an API also!)Its important to note that, while the Bounty Explorer is hosted on gitcoin.co, it is completely Open Source. And the data about tasks themselves and their funding is stored securely on the Ethereum blockchain. In contrast to any web2 application, where an economic incentive exists to horde data, Gitcoin is designed to never, ever, be in a position profit economically from your data.I invite you to join me in Gitcoin\u2019s mission to Push Open Source Forward, and check out the Gitcoin Bounty Explorer today at https://gitcoin.co/explorer.

A lie, of course \u2014 Greg was a double major in Engineering and CS and is one of the talents behind TruSet, a decentralized marketplace which is helping communities in information intensive industries get better data, faster. But it\u2019s befitting of a Web3 engineer \u2014 the no ego, the modesty. Greg and his kin are the humble, sometimes invisible, architects behind the blockchain space, putting the genius of the crowd first and creating the conditions for communities to thrive. They build and let build.The team at TruSet envisions a foundation of trusted, accurate data that establishes a new, primary source of truth for industry ecosystems. No more scattered data. No more unstructured PDFs. They\u2019re creating multi-sided marketplaces on the Ethereum blockchain for users to collect, validate, publish, and commercialize business-critical reference data without the intervention of vendors or service providers. Greg hopped on the team last year as Lead Engineer to build out the environment. Over the past month, TruSet has been focused on their Token Data Alpha, a marketplace on the Rinkeby testnet where participants can crowdsource and verify data for the emerging token ecosystem. TruSet\u2019s token data marketplace is poised to become a resource for the entire crypto community.The game mechanics are different on Ethereum, Greg has discovered. They\u2019re more participatory, and exponentially fairer and faster when the network is designed to align users\u2019 incentives. People will work in a network if it means less work for them in the long-run. Greg\u2019s mission right now is figuring out the optimal incentive alignment and helping the Ethereum community bootstrap the TruSet network into a public good that reinvents how we handle data. Our conversation started with Greg thinking back on a small script he wrote in college \u2014 a little, smart solution to a menial student job that ultimately paved the way for his work at TruSet today.How\u2019d you get into coding?I started writing code in maybe 4th or 5th grade. I built little websites with HTML and JavaScript. When I went to college, I thought I was going to be an electromechanical engineer \u2014 which definitely entailed a lot of programming \u2014 but I focused more on Computer Science as I progressed through school.Early on in school, I remember I had this data entry job for a hedge fund. They had this theory that there\u2019s some point at which a company gets large enough that it starts to make boastful marketing moves \u2014 like sponsoring a sports field \u2014 and that leads to a decline in stock price. So they had me looking through SEC documents for different initial public offerings and pulling out the number of shares that were issued, the initial share price, etc.So I wrote a script that was able to do hours of this boring work programmatically. It pulled structured data out of company filings, which is now what TruSet\u2019s platform incentivizes people to do. So things have kind of come full circle. Doing that data entry and automating a very laborious project was really inspiring for me to focus more on programming.How did blockchain pop on your radar?In college, I got pretty interested in technologies that I thought would build a better future. Global money was one, and generally what I might think of as subversive, leveling technologies \u2014 encryption, distributed systems \u2014 technologies that could really balance different players.What drew me to Ethereum a couple years later was that a lot of the work I was doing as a software engineer was mapping systems of authority and control onto software languages. But the systems we were building \u2014 centralized servers, etc. \u2014 were not as good of an analog for the ways that humans naturally communicate and interact as blockchain systems are. I think humans have a strong drive to form consensus, share data, and coalesce around a common set of rules and blockchains inherently allow that.You\u2019re saying the blockchain is natural in a way.I think all tools bias you to a solution \u2014 blockchain included. Blockchain\u2019s capabilities definitely lead to a particular view of how the world should be, and I think it\u2019s a more natural way for software to interact with markets. It\u2019s more participatory. Value will be transferred more often and more organically. These publicly accessible systems will hopefully, in some instances, act as public goods \u2014 complementing services that we\u2019ve traditionally gotten from centralized institutions, like governments.In your mind, what\u2019s the most interesting thing that blockchain can do?It allows people to self-organize around new systems and stores of value.What is TruSet doing on the blockchain?TruSet incentivizes people to share and validate structured data, to build a semantic web of data. Rather than everyone doing the same work of, say, pulling details out of SEC documents, they can collaborate to put them in a structured machine-readable format so that everybody can agree on the data that they\u2019re using to make trades or to make informed decisions.Did you come from the finance industry?No, I honestly don\u2019t know all that much about finance. The platform we\u2019re building is pretty general; it has very little to do with the underlying data that we\u2019re capturing. The idea is that if we can build a generic platform for publishing and validating data, and if we can set up the market incentives correctly, then the actual content of the data we\u2019re capturing doesn\u2019t really matter that much. It could be any type of structured data.What are the challenges you\u2019re facing right now? And what\u2019s the most exciting part for you as a developer?For a lot of our potential customers, the goal is pretty simple: they want better data, faster. Blockchain, I believe, can deliver on that, but not without a large network of participants. Getting people to join a decentralized network is difficult because you have to understand the nature of blockchain to use it and understand the new ways these systems are participatory, and network-oriented.Recently, I\u2019ve really enjoyed digging into the game theory mechanics in the blockchain space, which are pretty new to me. There\u2019s not a lot of really relevant literature that people have written about these mechanics. I think, like a lot of other topics in decentralized applications, it\u2019s so new that we\u2019re trying to figure them out on our own and really work through all the different incentives that people have. We\u2019re also testing to see what behaviors emerge when people are given a certain set of incentives.In your Token Data Alpha, what patterns of behavior have you noticed?I think a lot of what we\u2019ve seen is stuff that we expected, namely that people tend to vote along with the crowd and that people are more likely to do work if there\u2019s less work involved.Who are your influences as an engineer? What\u2019s in your personal canon?Many of the influential authors for me are right here at ConsenSys. I really like a lot of the stuff that Mike Goldin and Simon de la Rouviere have written. A lot of Vitalik\u2019s blog posts are pretty insightful and forward-thinking.Tell me about your process. When are your maker hours? What\u2019s your setup?Dvorak keyboard layoutI\u2019ve been using Linux for a long time, and I still do. I have tended towards DevOps work in the past few years, so I\u2019ve been using Docker to containerize all my projects so that they\u2019re portable. I type in Dvorak, which is a different keyboard layout, haha. One thing I like about ConsenSys is that I have a lot of flexibility in how I work. Several days a week I\u2019ll work from home. I like to split up my day \u2014 program for a few hours in the early morning, set it down, take a long lunch, maybe go the gym, and come back to it in the eveningDo you do different kinds of work in the morning hours versus the evening?Late night programming is when I do my most exploratory work. I\u2019ll experiment with big changes to the platform, put an hour or two into it, see what happens. My morning and afternoon contributions tend to be a little bit more measured and by the spec. I like to refactor on Fridays.How have you matured as a coder?I\u2019ve definitely geared more toward making smaller, more impactful changes to code in the past few years. I try to really condense my code changes down to the pure idea that needs to be expressed and separate the signal from the noise. I think I have become more self-directed in the things I do over the years. If something needs doing, I just do it, rather than waiting for things to come to a head.What are your tips for a developer who\u2019s new to the space?Read everything you can, especially code. Try to stay current. ConsenSys has a lot of Ethereum boilerplate \u2014 I\u2019m thinking about the token contracts, our basic implementation of ERC-20, ERC-223, etc. A number of our projects have open source repos, so those are worth a read. I like watching tech talks by the authors of new technologies to see their thought process. There\u2019s a lot of interesting work being done on scaling solutions recently, such as Plasma.What are some of your favorite projects at ConsenSys outside of TruSet?I find myself interested in projects that have some physical manifestation. I think it\u2019s my engineering background. I really like Grid+\u2019s work and how they\u2019re hooking people up to energy utilities at wholesale rates. Pangea is also super interesting, how they\u2019re tokenizing real estate. I think that\u2019s the kind of new system of value that blockchain enables us to facilitate.What is the moment of joy for you as an engineer?It\u2019s when people use my software. It has been really rewarding to see people actually go into our Alpha program and use it.It must be amazing to watch the community self-organize.Yeah! People are getting it. we\u2019ve seen people collaborate on different records and publish more and more complete and accurate data. now that we\u2019re starting to see people interact, we\u2019re getting a better handle on why we should make certain changes and what changes are most important to the participants.How has your experience been onboarding users to Web3?Once they\u2019re in, they\u2019re in. Once somebody understands how to authenticate with one decentralized app, I think that it\u2019s a much easier experience to join others. We\u2019re in an early-stage of all of this \u2014 10 years from now, 7-year-olds will understand what a public-private key pair is \u2014 or at least how to use them. But in the meantime, tools like MetaMask can be intimidating to new users. A lot of the UX that we\u2019ve been designing has been trying to ease that confusion.On the flip side, I think that these new paradigms will eventually make software even easier to use than conventional software. For example \u2014 People often say that usernames and passwords are easier to use than web3, but as an engineer who has built an \u201cI forgot my password\u201d feature like 10+ times for previous projects, and seen how often people actually use the feature, I don\u2019t necessarily think that passwords are really all that natural of a user flow anyway. With web3, sure, there\u2019s a learning curve, but at least you won\u2019t have to change your password by digging through your email for a reset link.What do you wish more people knew about Ethereum and about the ecosystem?A few years ago, I used to love when blockchain came up at parties. But now, people just want to talk about the exchange rates of these new digital currencies. That\u2019s less interesting to me and a lot of other engineers and coworkers that I\u2019ve met at ConsenSys. We\u2019re really interested in what this technology can do and less interested in the price of cryptocurrencies.If you could bounty anything, what would it be?It\u2019s tough for me to think of a big bounty that I\u2019d put on the development of something. I think Consensys and Joe are doing a pretty good job at highlighting those big opportunities. But on a kind of lower-level, we\u2019ve been using Gitcoin to incentivize some work on open source libraries that we use on the TruSet platform. It\u2019s great: you throw 40 bucks worth of Ether at a problem and then somebody across the world does it overnight and you come back in the morning to the feature you want. I\u2019m definitely sold on the bounties system.What has been the biggest lesson you\u2019ve learned at the command line?When I started with software, I assumed that all the skills I should be developing were around understanding the way computers want things, the way computers work and operate. But as I\u2019ve built more and more software, I\u2019ve realized that computers are just the tool, and good software is built by talking to a lot of people and figuring out how people plan to use the product. Maybe what I\u2019ve learned at the command line is to look up for a minute once in a while.Visit truset.com to sign up for more information about TruSet or if you would like to participate in the TruSet Token Data Alpha Program.

We\u2019re humbled by the number of talented teams working collaboratively to build a decentralized and open internet.We are proud to issue our first grant to ChainSafe Systems! ChainSafe will develop the next node implementation of the Polkadot Runtime Environment (PRE) in the Golang programming language.What is the Polkadot Runtime Environment (PRE)The PRE is a framework for developing blockchains and running them, including the Polkadot Relay Chain. It can also make the development of parachains on Polkadot easier by providing reusable components including: a networking layer, a consensus layer, and a Wasm interpreter.Unlike the Ethereum blockchain, where these two core components are the same, the Polkadot Runtime Environment is distinct from the Polkadot Runtime. This is intended to improve the modularity of the protocol. The necessary features are shown in the lower layers of the following diagram:Why build multiple implementations?It is critically important to have multiple implementations of the Polkadot protocol for a number of reasons, including decentralization, knowledge dispersion, and better definitions of the protocol. As a reminder, Parity Technologies is building the first implementation of Polkadot in Rust and a Polkadot JS in JavaScript.Multiple implementations of Polkadot improves network resilience and adds to the decentralization of the network. The governance of the network is more democratized when multiple teams build clients which run the nodes in the network. By building a the next implementation of the Polkadot protocol, ChainSafe is helping develop a robust network \u2014 meaning that if there\u2019s an issue with one client, it won\u2019t impact network availability \u2014 thus ensuring a healthy, resilient Polkadot ecosystem.By building a the next implementation of the Polkadot protocol, ChainSafe is helping develop a robust network \u2014 meaning that if there\u2019s an issue with one client, it won\u2019t impact network availability \u2014 thus ensuring a healthy, resilient Polkadot ecosystem.In order to test the core of the protocol and ensure a high quality specification, we need implementations that will be capable of running validator nodes in a production environment. These have to be performant enough to handle the demands of the network. While all clients should be compliant to the protocol some can be designed for specific users. W3F Research is working on progressing the Polkadot Runtime Environment specification and the latest version is available to read here.Development teams can optimize their clients for specific target markets, innovating in the architecture, usability and interfaces of Polkadot nodes to serve everyday users or enterprises. We hope that by issuing more PRE grants we will enable teams to creatively build even better Polkadot implementations.Through this grant, W3F hopes to increase the number of people and projects that are intimately familiar with the protocol. A wider distribution of knowledge about the core aspects of protocol means more people can consult or develop solutions on top of Polkadot. By opening up Polkadot to multiple languages people in different developer communities will be able to understand the core Polkadot technology, making it easier for them to contribute to core technology. W3F\u2019s goal is to make Polkadot core technology into a commodity so that it is accessible and more people can join in on discussion around protocol upgrades and research.Why Golang?Go is one of the more accessible and popular languages in the decentralized technology industry. The Go community is very healthy and continues to grow. Thus, by issuing this grant to ChainSafe to develop a PRE in Go, we hope to attract a new wave of developers to contribute to core Polkadot technology. Because Polkadot leverages WASM (learn why), it\u2019s important that any additional implementations of Polkadot compile to WASM. Plus, there is already a WASM interpreter in Go.Grant ProcessWeb3 Foundation announced the RFP for alternative implementations of the Polkadot Runtime Environment in July 2018. At that time we stated our preferred language was Go, followed by C++ and Java. We blasted the grant to all of our social media channels and mentioned it in articles and presentations. As a result we received a number of proposals and ultimately decided to move forward with ChainSafe and two other teams, to be announced soon. This was a result of ChainSafe development capabilities, including their work on Ethereum 2.0 and in the Ethereum community. Polkadot will be bridged to Ethereum some time after launch, and we hope this will enable the two protocols to work together to bring forward our collective vision of Web 3.0.Visit grants.web3.foundation to read about the evaluation process and how to apply for W3F Grants.About ChainSafe SystemsChainSafe is a grassroots team of 23 people from Toronto, Ontario, who met at local Ethereum Developer Meetups.

This event was created by the community, for the community. We\u2019ll use this space to reinforce the ethos of this gathering and share some videos and photographs that can help you form your own insights.

We care about building technologies that enable a radical redistribution of power that empowers communities to better organize themselves. Suffice to say (and as evidenced by the growing conversations around governance) it\u2019s no easy challenge and requires rethinking the status quo to find a better way.So when we thought about organizing the Web3 Summit, the last thing we wanted to do was follow the status quo of blockchain conferences. We asked ourselves a few questions: 1) how do we create a platform that empowers the community to create their own experiences? 2) how do we make it so attendees feel energized and inspired when they leave? 3) how do we create a higher signal to noise ratio than the usual 3-day blockchain event.These questions led us to a few conclusions. We decided on a sponsorship-free event with the intention of creating an environment where attendees could easily explore ideas and projects that interested them, without feeling inundated by ads, logos, and sponsored content. We also decided to rent tons of extra, free space where the community could create their own experiences at Web3 Summit, hosting pop-up meetups, workshops, and talks.Web3 Summit v1.0 beginsThe Summit kicked off with invigorating talks on the vision of Web 3.0 and how work together to not repeat the mistakes of previous iterations of the Web. Here are a few of our highlights:Defining Web 3.0 with Juan BenetWith Juan Benet, we defined Web 3.0 and compared it the earlier iterations of the web. One definition stood out, a quote from Web 3.0\u2019s early advocate Gavin Wood: \u201cConsider Web 3.0 to be an executable Magna Carta \u2014 \u2018the foundation of the freedom of the individual against the arbitrary authority of the despot.\u2019\u201d Juan went on: \u201cThe goals of Web 3.0 include (a) trustless infrastructure; (b) removing intermediaries; and \u00a9 giving users power and ownership over their data, identity, security, and transactions.\u201dMaking Web 3.0 usable with Patrick NielsenClovyr\u2019s Patrick Nielsen highlighted the opportunity we have today: it\u2019s different this time around, and we have a chance to use these tools in a way that empowers and protects people.\u201d However, blockchains, cryptocurrencies, and decentralized systems as a whole currently have a dearth of users, and notoriously lack a killer app. Patrick used the remainder of his time to focus on how to make Web 3.0 usable. Underlying the point that \u201cit won\u2019t build itself, and just because the tools exist does not mean it\u2019s going to get used.\u201dAfter additional discussions on where the original web failed, from Inria\u2019s Harry Halpin and Vlad Zamfir, the Summit shifted gears to focusing on the technology. There were a number of impressive announcements, including Substrate, Edgeware, and HTC Exodus. Gavin Wood live launched a blockchain in minutes, instead of days or weeks, on-stage for the audience.Gavin Wood live launching a blockchain using SubstrateOne of the more anticipated talks was the governance panel, with Gavin Wood (Polkadot), Arthur Breitman (Tezos), Vlad Zamfir (Ethereum), with Adrian Brink (formerly Tendermint, now W3F) moderating. We appreciate whichever individual who was thoughtful(/trollish) enough to bring enough popcorn to feed the packed room.The Summit closed with a reminder for why we all gathered here: a discussion between Amir Taki and Ashley Tyson on the origin of Bitcoin, a view towards post-maximalism, and how we can utilize this technology to empower human freedom.Amir Taaki & Ashley Tyson close out Web3 SummitThe HackerspaceWhile the main stage presentations shared incredible insights and inspiration, it was important to create a space where the community could come together to collaborate and build.The community powered hackerspace was the heart of the Web3 Summit. This experimental area was available for anyone to self-organize their own workshops, small talks, whiteboard sessions, working groups, or social spaces. There were pop-up nodes and meeting spaces where anyone could sign up to host an activity. From UX and design workshops, to security focused discussions (and lock-picking classes!), to helping facilitate sovereign natural environments (Nature 2.0) \u2014 the hackerspace provided a space to create and choose your own adventure.Thank you to everyone that stepped forward to fill this empty space with ideas and life. And a special thanks to all the node organizers who spent countless hours building and sharing, by creating spaces where anyone could feel free to drop by, ask questions, and contribute.Looking to the futureWe envision a Web3 Summit with no attendees \u2014 where everyone is a participant. Web3 Summit v2.0 will build upon this ethos of community and freedom. We will continue our commitment to prioritizing self organization by creating a permissionless space where you can feel empowered to bring your own ideas and your own contributions \u2014 no matter how far fetched or obscure they may seem!Join us in planning the next Web3 Summit!

They range from glorified TED talks and showcase conventions to smaller summits and pitch days where you present your ideas to different incubators, investors, and companies. If you\u2019re currently working on a project, have never been to a conference, or simply want some advice on networking, look no further than our first installment of Web3 Wisdom \u2014 your source for advice from ConsenSys\u2019 best and brightest.We talked with a few of the ConsenSys Labs, Catalyst, and Community team members, including Thomas Rush, Sarah Cerchi, Alexander Fields, Ryan Lechner, Everett Muzzy, and Adam Wozney about best practices for making the most of these conferences and summits. They work hard to organize, host, and attend these activations and are best suited to help you make the most of your time there. What are recruiters and investors looking for? What should you bring to the table in order to maximize the return on your efforts? What should you avoid when presenting? With these resources you\u2019ll be ready and well-prepared, particularly if you\u2019re looking to pitch your ideas to ConsenSys.Give these words of wisdom a look through below and leave a comment if you have any questions.

A decentralized web that will enable a way to resist censorship, provide privacy, and coordinate new economic and societal models that better represent users\u2019 interests. As part of that mission, we aim to convene, facilitate, and fund the projects, teams, and individuals that are building the frameworks of our freedom.The Web3 Summit is an extension of this mission. It is structured to be collaborative and break current norms \u2014 an experiment in creating a large scale, open source event. A gathering of developers, researchers, cryptoanarchists, democratic confederalists, privacy enthusiasts, technologists, blockchainers and \u201cnocoiners\u201d, do-gooders and up-to-no-gooders.To demonstrate our commitment to an open, inclusive community, the Web3 Foundation has offered to fund ticket reductions for attendees at the inaugural Web3 Summit: If you\u2019re contributing to the ecosystem or if you cannot afford the full priced ticket; you can apply for a subsidized ticket with a small contribution to the community. If you cannot afford the recommended contribution, Web3 Foundation\u2019s ticket endowment team will review your request for a fully reduced ticket. This is an investment in our community, and a token of our appreciation for the individuals working relentlessly on open source protocols.We very much welcome anyone who feels they are in a financial position forgo a price reduction and purchase the undiscounted ticket.We are so inspired by the enthusiasm and participation we\u2019ve seen from the community to organize, host, and generally contribute to the future success of Web3 Summit, which is why we have developed a plan to make the summit accessible to as many people as possible. It is representative of the openness and spirit of the community we work with on a daily basis.Here\u2019s what we\u2019re looking forward to most about Web3 Summit:Thirty-five interactive workshops ranging from privacy preserving smart contracts, various governance approaches, decentralized randomness protocols, and growing open source communities.A hackerspace consisting of ten different nodes, where teams can self-organize, host their own events, whiteboard out ideas, and have a place to camp out and call home for three days. There will be a pop-up node that anyone can sign up for and utilize during the course of the Summit.Web3 Summit is designed to be immersive and interactive, a place where you can also just hang out, meet others, share ideas, and make new friends. So we\u2019ve gone beyond technical workshops and presentations to create a cultural program that includes documentary screenings, art installations, decentralized dance parties, and community organized pop-up events. We invite you to come with an open mind, engage, talk to strangers, and leave with something way more valuable than you\u2019ll get from sitting in an auditorium looking at slides all day long.Last but not least\u2026 this is all taking place in an incredible venue: Funkhaus Berlin. Built in 1951 by the Deutsche Democratic Republic, it was once the largest radio broadcasting site in the world. Much of the content recorded and distributed here functioned as DDR propaganda. In addition, Funkhaus served an active hub for Stasi secret police surveillance. We chose this historic venue to remind us of our collective purpose and what is at stake.Early on we decided that we would deploy a no sponsorship policy. While sponsors help with offsetting a lot of the cost of putting together an event, they inevitably lead to pay-to-play dynamics and an oversaturation of logos and hyper-branded consumerism. We decided against bringing on sponsors to eliminate this noise so that we could focus on what really matters: the people doing the work.Our initial goal was to create a sustainable Summit that could be funded fully through ticket sales \u2014 without the need to generate a profit. We also wanted the Summit to be affordable to a diverse group of people \u2014 not just those working on well-funded projects. We have struggled with the idea that money might create a barrier to entry for our community, even with existing discounts and our reduced ticket application for students and builders.So, after thoughtful consideration, the Web3 Foundation has resolved to put our money where our mouth is and invest in our community. This means subsidizing the entry fee for everyone we can.How Can I Register For a Partially or Fully Reduced Ticket?Remaining tickets are limited and we will reach capacity. Sadly, we won\u2019t be able to accommodate everyone. Therefore, we ask that you submit a short application form for consideration. We give strong preference to developers, researchers, designers, community organizers, and the teams supporting this ecosystem. If you are able, we still ask that you purchase a full-price ticket. Builders and contributors (you do not have to be a dev!), students and others who cannot afford the full price are able to apply for reduced or free tickets. Our suggested contribution is 200 euros for a reduced ticket, which aligns with a one-day ticket option (but you can come all three!).What If I Already Bought A Ticket?Anyone who has already purchased a ticket to the Web3 Summit will have an option to receive a full or partial ticket price reduction. Ticket holders will receive an email with instructions detailing the price reduction process. We welcome anyone who feels they are in a financial position forgo a price reduction (we\u2019re looking at you, crypto rich folk and investors! :) to contribute their ticket cost to the Summit and the community that it will bring together.What\u2019s The Plan For Future Web3 Summits?We do not regret the decision not to include sponsorships from the start, and we continue to believe that this is the only way to create an uncompromised and value-driven community. While we\u2019d love to cover a significant portion of the entry costs to Web3 Summit every year, we unfortunately don\u2019t have the funds to facilitate this on an ongoing basis. We will, however, explore creative options to extend this community-first model while supporting the same level of extraordinary programming we have put together for this special inaugural milestone. We haven\u2019t begun planning the next one yet \u2014 but we hope you\u2019ll join us!Our aim is that this endowment conveys our appreciation to the individuals dedicating themselves to furthering the ecosystem. We also hope it sets the tone for our first Summit: we\u2019re in this together. Be helpful to one another. Teach. Learn. Find common ground. Make friends.

In fact, Truffle (the popular Ethereum dapp framework) injects this within their own test environment.Unfortunately, the framework itself (and its official examples) use the 0.20.x version of Web3.js. And while v1.0 is still technically in beta, more and more people are using it because it provides an API that is more explicit and is easier to work with (like PromiEvents, I\u2019ll talk about this below).In this article, I\u2019ll show you how to convert your Truffle tests to use the new Web3.js v1.0 API rather than the older 0.20.x versions. In the process, I will introduce some of the major changes that the v1.0 API brings.Our smart contractFor our example, let\u2019s use a simple increment/decrement counter with the following smart contract:pragma solidity ^0.4.24;contract Counter {  int count = 0;function increment() public {    count++;  }function decrement() public {    count--;  }function get() public view returns (int) {    return count;  }}Pretty basic, nothing too special about it. Now let\u2019s get into our Truffle tests.Our testsThis is what our test would look like if we followed the official Truffle documentation:This should also be pretty straight forward. We simply check that the initial value is 0, and that it can increment and decrement.Now let\u2019s see what it would look like with v1.0.It\u2019s largely the same, but there are two important differences:We use helpers from helpers.js (a file that we will create soon) so that we get access to the new Web3.js and its contract instance API.There is a new API for calling the smart contract methods.The helpersFirst, make sure you have a package.json file in your project. If not, simply run:npm init -yAnd then install the v1.0 version of web3:npm install web3Once we have that, create helpers.js in the same folder, then put the following into the file:For getWeb3, Since Truffle automagically injects the v0.20.x web3 into the global scope, we wrap it with our own v1.0 web3 and return the new one.For getContractInstance, because we want to make it a reusable function, we first take in the new web3, and then return a function that can create contract instances simply by passing in the contract name. So you can use it like this:// v1.0const web3 = getWeb3()const getInstance = getContractInstance(web3)const myContract = getInstance(\"MyContractName\")myContract.methods.myMethodName().call()Note that calling getInstance in the above example basically replaces the old way of getting a contract instance:// v0.20.xconst MyContract = artifacts.require(\"MyContractName\")const myContract = await MyContract.deployed()myContract.myMethodName.call()The new smart contract method APICalling smart contract methods are now namespaced under methods of the contract instance object. The new API looks something like this, depending on whether you are calling a constant function or a mutating one (i.e. read vs write):instance.methods.myMethod().call()instance.methods.myMethod().send({ from: \"0x...\" })Notice that the arguments for your smart contract method is now separated from the transaction-specific options (e.g. from and gas options). This allows you to build up your method call before actually sending it.Previously, the final function call would contain all the arguments of the methods, with the final argument at the end being your transaction options.// Oldinstance.myMethod(123, true, { from: \"0x...\" })// Newinstance.methods.myMethod(123, true).send({ from: \"0x...\" })// Also newconst doTheThing = instance.methods.myMethod(123, true)doTheThing.send({ from: \"0x...\" })  // execute it laterPromiEventsOne of the most convenient things with the new API is that contract methods now return a PromiEvent, which is a hybrid of a conventional Promise and an event emitter.That means you can attach numerous event handlers for the lifecycle of the transaction. But since it\u2019s also just a regular Promise, you can use await or .then() to do some work after the transaction has been mined. This provides a lot more flexibility for a better user experience.The following example is from the docs:web3.eth.sendTransaction({from: '0x123...', data: '0x432...'}).once('transactionHash', function(hash){ ... }).once('receipt', function(receipt){ ... }).on('confirmation', function(confNumber, receipt){ ... }).on('error', function(error){ ... }).then(function(receipt){    // will be fired once the receipt its mined});This would mean we can do something like this:const doSomething = instance.methods.myMethod(123, true)await doSomething.send({ from: \"0x...\" })  .once('transactionHash', (hash) => {     // notify user of the tx hash with an etherscan link  })  .on('confirmation', (confNumber) => {    // update UI to show the number of confirmations for this tx  })// the transaction has been mined, execute other code here!First, we created our method call and assigned it to doSomething. And then when we wanted to execute the transaction, we called .send() on it and passed in our transaction options.From there, we immediately let the user know the transaction hash and give them a link to the relevant Etherscan page. Once the transaction has been mined, the code will resume execution below.As an added bonus, we are also able to show the number of confirmations onto the UI if we wanted to.Try it outIt\u2019s my hope that the Truffle team can incorporate some of these ideas soon. It would be great to see more support for Web3.js v1.0. There\u2019s a severe lack of up-to-date and well-maintained Javascript libraries for working with Ethereum and I think this is the best way forward.In the mean time, I hope this article has helped you to better understand how to work with the new version of Web3.js.If you felt that this was helpful, please leave me a few claps and share!", "responses": 1, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Development", "Smart Contracts", "Solidity", "Blockchain"]}, {"title": "Technologies Driving Mainstream Web3 Adoption", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@austin_48503/technologies-driving-mainstream-web3-adoption-1b9d8686ba8c?source=search_post", "author_name": "Austin Thomas Griffith", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@austin_48503", "publish_date": "2018-10-01", "last_modified_date": "2018-10-01", "readtime": "3.32", "claps": 504, "voters": 28, "content": "Technologies Driving Mainstream Web3 AdoptionAustin Thomas GriffithFollowOct 1, 2018 \u00b7 4 min readSeamless onboarding powered by ephemeral key pairs signing meta transactionsPhoto by Victor Rodriguez on UnsplashA massive wave of mainstream web3 users is about to hit the Ethereum network. The best part is, they won\u2019t even know they are using the blockchain at first. And the heart of the trick dates back to cryptography from 30 years ago\u2026Effective decentralized applications will implement a platform where users can provide value and be rewarded with tokens or even ETH without any barrier to entry. Users should immediately interface with the application or game instead of wrestling with the blockchain. This means apps will need to pay for their users\u2019 initial interactions using meta transactions signed by ephemeral accounts. In this article we\u2019ll explore these techniques.As users interact with an application, they will realize its underlying value and accrue tokens within the small ecosystem of the Dapp. At this point, their ephemeral account no longer is viable (or safe) and they are incentivized to be educated in better wallet practices.Finally, an identity is established around the narrative the user chooses to create. This identity is their reputation within the space; they will want to protect it and represent it using something more approachable. They may want to put a name on an account. Instead of using a long public hash like 0x34aa3f359a9d614239015126635ce7732c18fdf3, it\u2019s a lot easier to communicate my address with an ENS name like austingriffith.eth.Ephemeral AccountsEthereum accounts can be created instantly without any kind of centralized authority using cryptography from the early 80's. The only thing you truly have to trust is the math and the code in the smart contract.When a user visits an app we generate an account automatically if they do not have MetaMask or another web3 provider injected. This temporary account can then be used to sign meta transactions to indirectly interact with the blockchain.Ephemeral private keys are stored in cookies in the user\u2019s browser. One problem with this is the cookies won\u2019t work across multiple domains. This is why we created https://account.metatx.io to generate and serve private keys from a shared domain while still storing them client-side. The user can then use the same temporary identity across multiple apps as they onboard.This is a bad idea. Passing private keys around or storing them in memory where they could be lost or stolen is just plain bad. But! When it comes to UX, it\u2019s time to make some tradeoffs to drive adoption. Once they earn value they can sweep their temporary account\u2019s ETH and tokens to a more secure wallet as we provide education behind this new paradigm.Meta TransactionsInstead of crafting and signing typical Ethereum transactions, an etherless account can simply sign the intent to transact. Then, send this meta transaction to an off-chain network of service nodes that is incentivized to pay the gas and submit the transactions on behalf of the user.Learn more about meta transactions here and on metatx.io.Meta Transaction Relay NetworkThis is a fantastic area of study right now. As many organizations begin to roll out solutions that are powered by meta transactions, the need for a peer-to-peer relay network becomes more and more apparent. It also isn\u2019t just about building the layer to work, but to be robust enough to defend against adversaries while cryptoeconomically incentivizing good actors.

Data access technologies such as databases, search engines or query APIs are so ubiquitous that we barely think about them when architecting software solutions. As Web 3.0, decentralized applications powered by blockchain technologies evolve, infrastructure blocks such as data access will become more relevant. However, solving data access in the blockchain have proven to be a very challenging endeavor that forces developers to spend significant amounts of time writing infrastructure code. Among, the Web3 data access solutions in the market, The Graph Protocol is that one that I particularly like because of its simplicity and clever utilization of modern technologies.We came across The Graph a few months ago during one of our blockchain implementations and have been testing and tracking the project ever since. The main idea behind The Graph is to make blockchain data queryable by leveraging established data access protocols such as GraphQL. While that idea sounds conceptually trivial, the implementation is full of non-trivial challenges.The Challenges with Querying Blockchain DataIn the last 5 decades of the software industry, every technology trends have seen an improvement in data access technologies as they have been able to build on the infrastructure created by previous trends. From file systems to the recent big data movement, the production cycles of data access technologies became shorter and the capabilities increasingly more sophisticated. That evolutionary picture completely changed with the advent of the blockchain technologies because, differently from other technology movements, the blockchain space reimagines data access starting from the storage and network protocol levels. From that perspective, most of the data access technologies and best practices from previous technology movements result impractical when apply to blockchains. Plain and simple, the Web 3.0 deserves a Web 3.0 data access protocol.What makes blockchain data access so challenging? In my opinion, this challenge has its roots in three fundamental causes:\u00b7 Decentralization: Data in blockchain lives in a decentralized network of nodes that are constantly replicating records among themselves. From the data access perspective, this model is far more complicated than centralized database infrastructures.\u00b7 Opacity: Data in the blockchain is subjected to different levels of encryption and obfuscation which makes it very difficult to interpret. Obviously, the whole point of a query protocol is to know what attributes to query for and that information is not easily accessible in blockchain stacks.\u00b7 Sequential Data Storage: Data in blockchains in captured in transactions stored in a sequential group of blocks. That block-transaction data structure offers very poor navigation capabilities which is what is needed to enable a solid data query protocol.The counter-interpretation of the three aforementioned challenges indicates that a robust Web 3.0 data access stack should have three main capabilities:i. Ability to access information as if it was stored in a centralized repository.ii. Ability to query records based on its attributes.iii. Ability to efficiently navigate the blockchain data based on a specific criteria.Some of these challenges have been solved by isolated technologies that we haven\u2019t had a consistent stack to put them all together.Enter The GraphConceptually, The Graph is a decentralized protocol for indexing and querying blockchain data. The Graph starts by creating a manifest that describes the representation of the blockchain data. The manifest can specify the attributes for a specific protocol of DApp. Once the manifest is created, The Graph captures the on-chain events from that specific protocol or application and indexes them into IPFS using the manifest as a guideline. Finally, the data is exposed by APIs based on the popular GraphQL protocol. The Graph endpoint will translate the GraphQL queries into IPFS commands used to access the data.From an architecture standpoint, The Graph is based on the following components:Graph CLI: A JavaScript based tool that allow developers to define subgraphs that describe the blockchain structures that will be indexed by The Graph. A subgraph consists of a subgraph manifest, schema, and mappings. The subgraph manifest points to the data sources to be indexed (for example a smart contract) and any decoding information (ABI). Mappings a TypeScript functions that describe how to transform or aggregate data. The Graph CLI compiles all this into a WASM module that can be executed by the Graph NodePostgres Store : A Postgress-based database that stores and indexes blockchain data into specific tables based on an (Entity, Attribute, Value) tuple. That structure maps effectively to the GraphQL syntax.GraphQL Server : A host for the GraphQL API and other components of the stack.Ethereum Adapter : A component that subscribes to Ethereum events using IPC or RPC and accesses smart contract storage.WASM Runtime Host : A module that executes the mappings to translate the blockchain data into indexable and queryable data structures.Skipping a few steps for the sake of simplicity, let\u2019s illustrate how The Graph protocol works. The first step is to define a subgraph manifest using a YAML syntax as the following:specVersion: 0.0.1schema:  file: ./schema.graphqldataSources:- kind: ethereum/contract  name: MyERC721Contract  source:    address: \"0x06012c8cf97BEaD5deAe237070F9587f8E7A266d\"    abi: ERC721  mapping:    kind: ethereum/events    apiVersion: 0.0.1    language: wasm/assemblyscript    entities:    - Token    abis:    - name: ERC721      file: ./abis/ERC721ABI.json    eventHandlers:    - event: Transfer(address,address,uint256)      handler: handleTransfer    file: ./mapping.tsAs you can see from the definition, the previous subgraph captures the data in the Transfer event of a specific smart contract(MyERC721Contract). The specific data to be captured is defined by the Contract ABI JSON file:[{    \"anonymous\": false,    \"inputs\": [      {        \"indexed\": true,        \"name\": \"_from\",        \"type\": \"address\"      },      {        \"indexed\": true,        \"name\": \"_to\",        \"type\": \"address\"      },      {        \"indexed\": true,        \"name\": \"_tokenId\",        \"type\": \"uint256\"      }    ],    \"name\": \"Transfer\",    \"type\": \"event\"  }]The next step is write a mapping function that transform the data from the Ethereum blockchain based on the specific subgraph:import { Transfer } from './types/abis/SomeContract'// This is an example of an entity type generated from a// subgraph's GraphQL schemaimport { Token } from './types/schema'export function handleTransfer(event: Transfer): void {    let tokenID = event.params.tokenID.toHex()    let token = new Token(tokenID)    token.currentOwner = event.params.to    token.save()}At this point, the subgraph can be deployed and we can start listening from events from the Ethereum blockchain. The current version of The Graph supports can collect Ethereum data using Infura, hosting a local Ethereum node or Ganache. The following code starts up a Graph node listening to data via the Infura API:cargo run -p graph-node --release -- \\  --postgres-url postgresql://<USERNAME><:PASSWORD>@localhost:5432/<POSTGRES_DB_NAME> \\  --ethereum-rpc <ETHEREUM_NETWORK_NAME>:https://mainnet.infura.io \\  --ipfs 127.0.0.1:5001 \\  --debugFinally, we can query data using a typicaly GraphQL syntax:{  tokens {    id    currentOwner  }}Developers have already deployed subgraphs for popular protocols and DApps using The Graph. You can see many of them using the Graph Explorer which provides a slick user interface to execute GraphQL queries against specific smart contracts or DApps.The Graph is a very good iteration to address one of the most important challenges of Web 3.0 applications. By leveraging established technologies such as IPFS, Postgress or GraphQL, The Graph is lowering the entry point for developers querying blockchain data. To make things even more exciting, the current version of The Graph was recently open sourced and is being actively version. Although still in very early stages, The Graph seems to have the technological foundation to become one of the most important protocols of the Web 3.0 movement.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Ethereum", "Cryptocurrency", "Blockchain Technology", "Invector Labs"]}, {"title": "Web3 Apps and Products: Trustless, Synergistic and Monetizable.", "post_link": "https://blog.wavesplatform.com/web3-apps-and-products-trustless-synergistic-and-monetizable-707172185e9b?source=search_post", "author_name": "sasha ivanov", "author_link": "https://blog.wavesplatform.com/@emergentlogic", "publish_date": "2019-01-03", "last_modified_date": "2019-01-03", "readtime": "3.01", "claps": 281, "voters": 25, "content": "Web3 Apps and Products: Trustless, Synergistic and Monetizable.sasha ivanovFollowJan 3 \u00b7 4 min readWe live in the era of tectonic shifts in society and technology. The shape of the future world is still quite vague, and changing all the time. Futuristic concepts that have been proposed not so long ago stop making sense or need to be adjusted. One thing is obvious \u2014 development of the Internet will be crucial for the development of the world we live in, and what happens to the Internet will essentially happen to the world.The concept of Web3.0 that emerged almost twenty years ago acquires a more tangible shape only now. Because of the emergence of the blockchain technology we are starting seeing some products that can be called Web3 prototypes. It\u2019s still too early to lay out the standards for the future Web, we might need some more products to actually understand what those standards should be. On the other hand, we could define Web3 products essentials, since now we have all the major ingredients for building applications that are essentially different from the applications we are accustomed to now.Web1, the original Internet, was just a collection of interlinked documents with very little interactivity. Web2, the Web we use now, is interactive but centralized, it essentially mimics the structure of human society with ineffective vertical structures, controlling but at the same time vulnerable. Current Internet infrastructure quite often brings out the worst in society: due to the increased number of social connections we get fragmentation and segmentation on steroids \u2014 despite its global nature the Internet paradoxically leads to less, not more, connectivity in many cases.Web3 was proposed as Semantic Web, a Web of Meaning. It might sound different from the Web3 we have in mind now, but if we look more closely we\u2019ll see that it\u2019s not really the case. \u201cSemantic\u201d in this setting means understandable by computers and running according to protocols, decentralization is essential in the true semantic approach. Protocol becomes the king of Web3, there\u2019s no need for trust any more, once established Protocol runs indefinitely and cannot be manipulated.Web3 needs decentralization in its core; decentralization is not the whole of it but it is the foundation for other technologies. This is the glue that connects disparate technologies in a synergistic consortium. Web3 is holistic, it does not pit one technology against another, it brings them together on a layer which minimizes the need for trust.Web3 is going to be deeply intertwined with the society structure, in Web2 you have some stale concepts brought over to the Internet, now the process becomes reversed \u2014 Web3 leads the way, showing more effective approach to human interaction.So what are the essential features of Web3 Products and applications?Web3 products minimize the need for trusted third parties and let you control your data.All the data created by the user is controlled by the user; she explicitly allows access to her data including all the data she produces. Private keys are stored on the user side, there is no need for centralized user authentication. Data storage is as decentralized as possible; only encrypted data can be stored in a centralized way. Access to sensitive user data is fully controlled by the user.Web3 products are synergistic. Combination of different technologies is essential, combined they produce new added value.Combinations of IoT, Big Data, AI and distributed ledgers are very natural, they create trustless data processing environment that cannot be manipulated.Monetization of Web3 products is transparent. There\u2019s no hidden monetization through collected user data. You get what you paid for, and you know how the money is made.New technology begets new economy. Through tokenization we achieve transparency in Web3 business models. Decentralized does not mean non-monetizable, it means monetizable in a new and transparent way.So what Web3 products are we going to see soon? Browsers with an integrated blockchain layer and private keys stored on the user side; uncensored or community-censored social networks where access to the network cannot be denied and user data deleted uncontrollably; messengers that run on blockchain private/public key pairs and, even if not completely decentralized, allow for multiple public servers; enterprise systems running on a decentralized layer and processing huge amounts of data in real time.Web3 concept is inclusive, it it not a concrete product, it is rather a philosophy that can be implemented for any application type. In 2019 first true Web3 products will be launched.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Web3"]}, {"title": "Web3 Design Decision Making Framework", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@lyricalpolymath/web3designdecisionframework-e84075816515?source=search_post", "author_name": "beltran", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@lyricalpolymath", "publish_date": "2019-01-23", "last_modified_date": "2019-02-22", "readtime": "9.74", "claps": 258, "voters": 26, "content": "Web3 Design Decision Making FrameworkInitial results of the research for the Web3 Design System that teach how to make sense of Web3 user problems and how to solve thembeltranFollowJan 23 \u00b7 10 min readfinding a clean and easy path across the forest of Web3 problemsWhat is Web3 and what is Web3 Design? What are the special limitations and requirements of this field? What are the best practices for designing and building decentralized applications? How do you think about the usability problems in this space and how can we begin to solve them?These are some of the questions that we\u2019ve started to unravel and tackle while doing the research for the Web3 Design System in the last couple of months, and that we started to condense in a Web3 Design Decision Framework: a tool to help designers and developers alike make better design choices while creating their dApp.What is a Web3 Design System?With the Web3 Design System we aim at building something similar to Google\u2019s Material Design but for the Web3:a series of \u200bguidelines\u200b and Design Principles, focused around the specific UX needs of distributed applicationsa library of components for developers to\u200bquickly develop Dapp front-ends, through simple and\u200b composable web3 specific components\u200band UX flows, that automatically implement\u200bthe Web3 Design Principles and the other UX guidelinesWhy a Web3 Design System is importantAs highlighted in many other places , currently the experience of using decentralized applications is overwhelmingly difficult and scares a lot of novice users away.If we want mass adoption of Ethereum and decentralized applications, we must provide the users with understandable and consistent interaction patterns, so that they can learn them through repetition: whether they end up on Aragon or Status or another dApp, users need to see the same treatment for informing how to \u201cunlock a wallet\u201d, or what\u2019s the \u201cstatus of a Transaction\u201d that has been sent and other interactions that are unique to the Web3.We are talking about the functionality, the application\u2019s behaviour, which should of course be customizable and brandable by each company.Like \u201cpinching\u201d to zoom, or \u201cswiping\u201d to change a screen have become second nature to us, we are now building the new interaction patterns that will become the standards of using Web3 decentralized applications.Methodology \u2014 How we are doing itIn the Web3 Design Principles that I published at the beginning of the year there are some Web3 components that hint at how we could solve certain usability problems of web3 distributed Application.However some ideas presented in that article were supported by a much lighter research if compared with the extensive one that we are now undertaking.For the last couple of months we\u2019ve started the research for the Web3 Design System thanks to a generous Nest grant from Aragon. In this initial phase we are interviewing designers, front-end developers, user researchers, product people, anyone who has spoken to users in the Ethereum space, and possibly the users themselves.(\ud83d\udccc\ud83d\udce3 we are still doing the interviews, so if you have insights for us please get in contact )The research phase aims at gathering and analysing what are the most important and urgent UX problems in the blockchain space and what are the current solutions or best practices that designers and developers are seeing, so that we can bake them into the components that we and the community will design and build.Devcon4 and the various Design Systems in the spaceDevcon4 was the first time we had a Design track (and a Systems & Society track too) in a conference historically dedicated to developers. Among the many awesome design activities, talks, sessions and workshops, 3 efforts around Web3 Design Systems have been presented at Devcon:our own Open Source Community driven Web3 Design SystemRimble - Consensys Design SystemLorikeet - Aragon promoted but community adopted Web3 Design SystemWe will very probably converge on Lorikeet and build our own components on the strong foundation that Aragon built and that others are starting to improve and build upon.some of the companies and projects we\u2019ve interviewedThe Web3 Design Decision FrameworkAt Devcon we presented the initial insights that we extracted from the interviews, which we formalised into the Web3 Design Decision Framework, a tool, a mental framework to help you think about the problems users have with the blockchain and Web3 dApps, and how to start solving them.\u2753 The Web3 Problem SpaceWe\u2019ve asked to people and companies that we\u2019ve interviewed, what are the questions their users have, about using their dApp or about the blockchain in general.Some questions are fun, like\u201chow do I find these projects in the OTHER internet?\u201dand other questions are fundamental to the space, like\u201cwhy should I care?\u201da cloud of many different problems \u2014 how to classify them?We tried to make sense of all these questions and problems and we found out that there are 2 macro categories in which these problems can fit:1 \u2014 problems that have to do with the technical workings of the blockchain2 \u2014 doubts that relate to fundamental concepts of decentralizationOf course, in some cases, there is some obvious overlapWe then mapped all these questions into this Venn diagram that we call the \u201cProblem Space\u201d.In the set of technicalities fit questions like \u201cwhat is gas?\u201d or \u201chow do I get ETH?\u201d; while in the fundamental to decentralization set we find questions users have like \u201ccan you reset my private key\u201d which indicate their misunderstanding of the PURPOSE of decentralized technologies.Decentralization requires new mental models. Moreover the Blockchain space is filled with new complicated concepts and we are doing a bad job at explaining them!Of course these sets are a crude simplification and there are possible subcategories, even more than the ones shown here.But there are 2 common thoughts and patterns that jumped out:On one side, we\u2019ve seen is that there is a consensus among many that we\u2019ve interviewed that decentralization requires new mental models. For example users struggle to understand that the data is not owned by one company or service, revealed by their confusion when they are presented with 2 different wallets that show the same token amounts).The second unanimous belief is that the Web3 is filled with new complicated concepts that are completely unfamiliar to users, like gas, transactions, private keys, Tokens, etcIt appears that, not only they are complicated concepts, but we are also doing a bad job at explaining them.\u2757\ufe0f The Web3 Solution SpaceWhen we rationalised the solutions that the interviewers told us are working for some of these problems, we found out what we call the \u201cSolution Space\u201dIt\u2019s a tool, a mental framework, that will help us in the design of the components for the Web3 Design System and that can help you too make design decision about how to solve the problems your users have.There are mainly 2 different solutions:either you can hide or abstract away a technical problem that is making the life of the user difficult,or you explain it betterWeb3 Design Problems are Multidimensional !An example will make things much more clearer.One of the first interesting things that we discovered is that Web3 Design Problems are multidimensional, which is a fancy way of saying that they can fall in multiple buckets/categories in the problem space and also in the solution space.For example, users have many different questions around gas, but these can be grouped together into 3 main categories:\u201ctechnicalities\u201d that can be hidden to them through by using some technical solution\u201ctechnicalities\u201d that unfortunately we don\u2019t yet know how to hide from the user and that hence we can only make the effort of explaining betterand questions that are fundamental to decentralization that we should not hide at all and can only try to find better explanations forFor example, practically every user asked \u201cwhat is gas?\u201d, \u201cwhat is gas price?\u201d, \u201cwhat is the gas limit?\u201dAll these questions relate to some technical mechanism of how Ethereum works and different wallets learned and taught us that it worked well to hide these optional settings from the user, giving them a simple interface and pre-made choices.Another technical solution that recently emerged and that completely abstracts away gas (and therefore gas price and limit choices from the user), is the new pattern of the Universal logins by Alex Van de Sande and the MetaTransactions that go with it.The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is also another technical solution that can hide the complexity of hashes behind a simple human readable name. Although it must be said that some of the interviewees have pointed to situations in which they think addresses should be shown.Another question is \u201cwhy does gas have different costs in different times?\u201d and this although it\u2019s still a technical question can\u2019t be yet hidden away (probably until we create gas futures) because a user who performs the same action on a dApp in different moments will see the different fees she had to pay and will of course start to ask questions about them. In this case, the solution space tells you that you need to find a better explanation; until of course a technical solution comes and we can push the problem into the \u201chide\u201d bucket.For important questions like \u201cWhy do I have to pay for gas?\u201d or \u201cdoes the dApp get the gas fee?\u201d relate to understanding how the Ethereum flavour of decentralization works. In this case you can only try to find a better explanation and this should not be hidden.\ud83d\udccc Solutions: best practices for subsets of the solutions spaceThe Solution space gives hints at how you can tackle part of the problems, according to how you can classify them.From the interviews we\u2019ve extracted some key insights on how we and you can use this solution space1 \u2014 hide or abstract away complicated technicalities, if you canPlus there is a spreading consensus that it is ok to use a different degree of centralization, at least temporarily for the new users, so that they don\u2019t get scared away. We talked about this in the Alliance for Mass adoption proposal, where you can initially hide the complexities of interacting with the blockchain through a MetaTransactions layer, or in other cases, through a centralized server to help onboard the users.Of course this is only a temporary solution and you should, at a later stage, onboard the users onto the fully decentralized solution.2 \u2014 explain better the technicalities you can\u2019t hideFor technicalities that can\u2019t yet be abstracted away you can only try to explain better and to do that, you can use analogies with mechanisms that the users already know.For example, if you are designing a financial application you can take inspiration from the experience of banking apps that will be familiar to the users.3 \u2014 explain better the topics relating to the essence of decentralization, starting with the why.For topics or problems that relate to the fundamentals of decentralization you only should explain them better and you can help you with those tips:- start with the \u201cwhy\u201d, the motivating factors, - which means to begin with explaining the BENEFITS, the ADVANTAGES of using this particular dApp, instead of explaining how it works, like every dApp is doing todayIn the presentation that we gave at Devcon we also added a couple of other examples, around transactions and private keys, and a couple of generic insights. Check the video here \ud83c\udfa5(there is also the version with slides that you can jump to on Slideslive)\ud83d\udee0 Next steps \u2014 test the framework\u201cA model is a good model if first it interprets a wide range of observations in terms of a simple and elegant model, and second if the model makes definite predictions that can be tested, and possibly falsified, by observation\u201d \u2014 Stephen HawkingThe Web3 Design Decision Framework wants to be a tool to help you design better solutions.This is a theoretical model for Web3 Design, but as Stephen Hawking let us understood it needs to be tested by you to see if it fits also your observations and if it effectively helps you predict solutions that will actually work better.Gendry and Nas from the FlightPlan run a Blockchain Product Design course and they have tested the framework with designers who are new to the Web3 space. Some early learnings have show that:1- Most problems look like technicalities at first to users and designers new to this space; it requires a level of expertise in web3 design to categorise problems into \u201cfundamental to decentralisation\u201d.2 - However for experienced Web3 designers, the framework is incredibly valuable as a methodological approach adding precision to categorising user research. It provides much needed guidance for decisions on what to abstract vs. what to explain to users\u201dand she adds: \u201cwe hope to add more detail to this framework as we identify more of the nuanced needs for different Dapp user types.\u201dPlease test it and tell us if it works and how to improve on it.You can either write me on Twitter (@lyricalpolymath ) or on Telegram (@lyricalpolymath), and also join the conversation on the dedicated Conflux Forum post. Beyond this, we are still in the interviews phase so if you have talked to users or have any insights that you learned while designing or developing your dApp, please let us know, we\u2019d love to interview you.Acknowledgments\ud83d\ude4f This research was made possible thanks to a generous grant by Aragon\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f of course these findings would have not been possible without the insights and experience of the many people that we\u2019ve interviewed\u2026to all of you, a big thank you!", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Web3", "Design", "Design Thinking", "Methodology"]}, {"title": "Introducing Web3 Foundation grants", "post_link": "https://medium.com/web3foundation/introducing-web3-foundation-grants-442f6753926a?source=search_post", "author_name": "Web3 Foundation Team", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@web3", "publish_date": "2018-12-05", "last_modified_date": "2019-02-20", "readtime": "2.38", "claps": 245, "voters": 25, "content": "Introducing Web3 Foundation grantsWeb3 Foundation TeamFollowDec 5, 2018 \u00b7 3 min readWeb3 Foundation is pleased to announce the launch of grants.web3.foundation.

This will help you gain exposure and help us develop together faster, while mitigating duplicative work. Of course, we are also happy to see and expect multiple teams to develop their own solutions for building out the ecosystem.Please use this template when commenting on an issue. It is also possible for project teams to suggest new ideas: to do so simply create a new issue, like community members Adrian Brink and Ankur Daharwal did here and here!If you see that someone is working on an issue you\u2019re interested in that does not mean it is complete! Only once an issue is \u201cclosed\u201d is the opportunity over. Learn more about how labels work here.If you\u2019d prefer to not publicly disclose your intention to work on an issue, you can reach out to a team member directly by on Twitter (Edward & Jack) or Riot (Edward: @edwardt:matrix.org & Jack: @pimpnDOTs:matrix.org). However, we encourage everyone to work within the GitHub repository as announcing your intention publicly is the best way to gain exposure for your project, apply for funding, and work within the community.Grant OpportunitiesThe first grant available is the Polkadot Runtime Environment (PRE) grant. Web3 Foundation is funding the development of an alternative implementation of PRE, which is a core component of Polkadot. This will be the third client for Polkadot and will operate alongside Parity Technologies\u2019 Rust and JavaScript implementations.The analogy for the Ethereum ecosystem is the Parity (Rust) and Geth (Go) clients. PRE is similar to Parity Substrate, but will be written in a language other than Rust.Building for PolkadotWe\u2019ve been encouraged by the quality of teams working to develop general ecosystem components for Polkadot. However, there is still a lot of work to be done. If you\u2019re interested in getting in at the ground floor of the Polkadot ecosystem, we encourage you to look into the following issues:Node explorersWalletsBlock explorersFunding is available for building general ecosystem components for Polkadot.Building ParachainsPolkadot makes it really easy to build and connect blockchains, so it\u2019s no surprise that the most popular issue to-date has been creating parachains for Polkadot. The best way to get started building a parachain is to visit the Parachain Wiki.Host a meetupWeb3 Foundation is trying to make it as easy as possible for you to host a Polkadot meetup in your local community. We\u2019re empowering community leaders by providing template presentations, logos, and instructions on \u201chow to host a meetup.\u201d Anyone is free to host a Polkadot meetup, but if you\u2019d like to find potential collaborators, apply for funding, or gain more exposure, we encourage you to apply to host a meetup.TestersTesters and tinkerers are some of the most valuable members of our community. It\u2019s not at all rare for the Polkadot and Web3 Twitter accounts to post about members of our community or allow for community members to post directly to official Medium accounts.

We are humbled by the number of high quality grant applications we\u2019ve received and are excited to help projects bring these technologies into reality.If you are interested in applying for a Web3 Foundation grant then you will be happy to know that more funding is available, so we kindly welcome more teams to apply and submit their ideas. Details of how to apply can be found on our grants page.RecipientsMost of the teams in this round of winners were creating new Substrate modules, which means more features for future parachains. We are hoping that many of the teams building these new modules will become parachains!Cap9 \u2014 A low-level security protocol and framework for smart contracts (GitHub)Substrate Java API \u2014 Java version of our JS API (GitHub)Starlog \u2014 A metadata chain for IPFS (GitHub)MixBytes \u2014 Benchmarking tool for Substrate and Polkadot (GitHub)Gunclear \u2014 Private secure data storage solution using Plasma Cash in Substrate (GitHub)ZeroChain \u2014 Zero knowledge transactions in Substrate (GitHub)Robonomics \u2014 Substrate modules for controlling robots (GitHub)Avado \u2014 Polkadot node deployment with consumer hardware (GitHub)Plasm \u2014 Plasma modules for Substrate (GitHub)HOPR \u2014 Substrate integration with this P2P messaging protocol (GitHub)Mailchain \u2014 a Multi-Blockchain Messaging Application (GitHub)Usetech \u2014 Polkadot C++ API (GitHub)Future GrantsWe intend to continue funding projects until the end of this year and perhaps even into 2020, so it\u2019s never too late to apply! To get an idea of what we are interested in funding for our ecosystem, we invite you to look at our areas of interest.One of the most important areas of interest for future grants is bridges. Please check out our current document on \u201cDesign Considerations for Bridging to PoW Chains\u201d. We welcome proposals for bridges to other major blockchains.How to Successfully ApplyThe main purpose of our grants program is to get teams started on building cool technology that\u2019s useful for our ecosystem. Please note, everything must be open source and we are only able to provide funding up to a maximum of $100k. The funding is non-dilutive, so we never take any ownership, but consequently we don\u2019t try to sustain a business via our grants program. We are happy to cover building costs, but typically don\u2019t pay for on-going maintenance costs (or similar).Ideally the scope of the work fits within 3 months too. Here are the main criteria of our grants:Focus on Substrate / Polkadot related projects.Max $100k.Timeframe: up to 3 months is ideal.Open source license.The application process itself is fairly easy, although most applicants find creating a good roadmap to be tricky. We recommend that the scope of the work can fit within a 3 month period and that teams structure their roadmap as 1 month = 1 milestone.Below is a mock roadmap. It is always best to describe the functionality we should expect, plus how we can check that such functionality exists in the product. Please also note how your project is related to Substrate/Polkadot.Milestone 1 \u2014 Implement Substrate Modules \u2014 1 month \u2014 $10,000We will create a Substrate module that will <list the functions that will be coded for the first milestone>.We will deliver a working module, along with a simple tutorial that explains how a user can spin up one of our Substrate nodes. Once the node is up, it will be possible to send test transactions that will show how the new functionality works.Milestone 2 \u2014 Additional features \u2014 1 month \u2014 $10,000Describe the next round of features and functions that will be added.Explain how you will demonstrate that the functionality you built will work as intended.Milestone 3 \u2014 Additional features \u2014 1 month \u2014 $10,000Describe the last round of features and functions that will be added.Explain how you will demonstrate that the thing you functionality will work as intended.Additional pointsPlease include documentation (for example tutorials) in your milestones.Indicate if you accept partial payment in DOTs.We recommend providing a docker container for the delivery of your project. This removes the need to install specific dependencies on a per-project basis which can cause delays in having milestones assessed.Since the milestones will appear in the grant contract, it helps to have as much detail as possible. Whenever milestones as delivered, we reference the contract to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.Get in touchShould you have any questions about the grants process then feel free to reach out: grants@web3.foundationWe also have Riot channels for real-time discussions on Web3 and Polkadot:Web3 FoundationPolkadot WatercoolerPolkadot Telegram", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Grants", "Web3", "Polkadot", "Substrate"]}, {"title": "New Video: Rosella Node \u2014 learn the language of Web3!", "post_link": "https://blog.mainframe.com/new-video-rosella-node-learn-the-language-of-web3-fe1052708383?source=search_post", "author_name": "Mick Hagen", "author_link": "https://blog.mainframe.com/@mickhagen", "publish_date": "2019-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2019-04-03", "readtime": "1.18", "claps": 223, "voters": 17, "content": "New Video: Rosella Node \u2014 learn the language of Web3!Mick HagenFollowMar 27 \u00b7 2 min readWith the public launch of Mainframe OS right around the corner, it\u2019s time to brush up on your communication skills.

Marlboro Friday is important to the branding industry \u2014 it opened up the subject of how much a brand is really worth. And almost everything that we know about branding has happened since that Friday, 2.4.1993. Following this milestone, a whole new methodology of calculating a brand\u2019s value and brand-management practices emerged; mechanisms were created that make it possible for a brand to represent the company\u2019s main value. In the age of data, we all know data has power, these kinds of practices don\u2019t yet exist.We are yet to see if the expression Facebook Monday will stick, but in my opinion, there are quite a lot of reasons for this to happen:Facebook is the main symbol of Internet 2.0 \u2014 so we have the right brand,there was a tangible drop in its stock price andit was on a Monday.I guess there is something to it, considering the amount of time it took Facebook to come up with a response.It is also very likely we\u2019re not dealing with an isolated case \u2014 others will follow, but this one, the first one, will be the symbolic mark of the pinnacle, and the beginning of the end, of Internet 2.0 as we know it. Cambridge Analytica was doing some weird things and everybody knew that Facebook was their main sandbox. And they were doing that for years\u2026 It had to blow up at some point.Wrong, we do care!That still leaves us with the question \u2014 what\u2019s the main point? This Monday the business model of the Internet 2.0 received a defining blow. The giants of the internet are giving away services free in exchange for gathering and using the footprints we leave behind. This whole economy, its business model, is based on an assumption that we, the individuals, don\u2019t care what happens to our data.When this assumption fails, the Internet 2.0 crumbles. We\u2019re not far from that inflection point, and it all started on 12.3.2018. The looming GDPR directive: it will come into force in May, and will probably seal the fate of Internet 2.0. Together with its demise, a hefty chunk of the data-abusing economy could go down with it.No more data, no more data business?If we\u2019re very extreme, the concept of \u201cdata is the new oil\u201d is as good as dead at the moment. With GDPR data basically disappears. The pumps we have been using until now won\u2019t work anymore. So, if Marlboro Friday marks the beginning of a serious development in branding, Facebook Monday could mark the beginning of a responsible and ethical use of consumer data, in which the consumers will be the ones that decide each use of their data.As long as the goal was targeted \u201cinforming\u201d about new products and services, and as long as this new marketing approach had a proven track record, things were fine. The problem arose when this same machine gave us Trump and Brexit. Considering how Cambridge Analytica openly touted the effectiveness of their tools, and since we now have definitive proof their methods were illegal, sooner or later the status of the 2016 American elections and Brexit will come into question. And this is happening! We\u2019re therefore faced with an ethical issue \u2014 Gregor \u017davcer (Datafund) recently held a talk on this issue.Facebook Monday doesn\u2019t as much surprise as it confirms the sneaking suspicions that have haunted us for a while now. Those of us who are involved in privacy advocacy have been warning people about it for a long time.The Internet 2.0 is dead, long live the blockchainUsually, before something leaves this world, something new is born. At the beginning, this little creature is a bit clumsy, it falls and gets up again\u2026 This is the phase in which the makings of the new internet, the Internet 3.0, are right now. The problems plaguing Internet 2.0 \u2014 identification, trackability, the chance of micropayments \u2014 are easily solved in version 3.0 and from the start.It is not Facebook issue that questioned the Internet as we know today. Gavin Wood proposed the vision of Web 3.0 back in 2014 describing it as \u201cpost-Snowden\u201d web or even better a \u201cSecure Social Operating System\u201d.This new Internet 3.0 will very likely be based on blockchain or another kind of distributed / decentralised technology. No one can be 100% sure if blockchain will be the silver bullet to bring us the internet as it should be. What I am sure of is that the internet as it shouldn\u2019t be has turned the first page of its final chapter.If you want to join us, follow us on the following channels:Telegram / Twitter / Website / Medium", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Privacy", "Web3", "Blockchain", "Ourstory"]}, {"title": "Mike Novogratz: \u201cEthereum is By Far the Most Robust Web3 Platform\u201d", "post_link": "https://media.consensys.net/mike-novogratz-ethereum-is-by-far-the-most-robust-web3-platform-d8c0d22d0e8a?source=search_post", "author_name": "ConsenSys", "author_link": "https://media.consensys.net/@ConsenSys", "publish_date": "2019-05-09", "last_modified_date": "2019-05-09", "readtime": "6.45", "claps": 173, "voters": 20, "content": "Mike Novogratz: \u201cEthereum is By Far the Most Robust Web3 Platform\u201dIn advance of his return to Ethereal Summit NY, the investment icon talks BTC, ETH, and what venture capitalists get wrong about blockchain.ConsenSysFollowMay 9 \u00b7 7 min readWhen Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz speaks, it\u2019s not just the crypto industry that sits up and takes notice \u2014 traditional investors, Wall Street, media heavyweights, and legacy institutions alike know him to be a bellwether for the digital asset space, an investor who leads by example, and an unflinching voice of reason in the tumult of the emergent blockchain business.Novogratz\u2019 addresses at Ethereal Summit in the past have become the stuff of legend for bold ideas delivered without holding punches \u2014 take, for example, \u2018The Herd is Coming,\u2019 his 2017 talk at Ethereal SF. Meanwhile the Galaxy Digital portfolio has grown to include notable endeavors like Bakkt, Messari, Bitstamp, and Bitgo, all projects that push digital assets closer to the tipping point.In leading the charge for digital assets on Wall Street while simultaneously bringing his formidable investment nous to the crypto world, Mike Novogratz has carved out an essential role as the connector between two markets and communities that will only continue to grow more and more symbiotically linked.In advance of Mike\u2019s return to Ethereal Summit NY, we spoke to the crypto investment icon about Bitcoin, Ethereum, investment strategy, and what venture capitalists get wrong about blockchain\u2026What\u2019s you bird\u2019s eye take on digital assets and blockchain right now?I really think Bitcoin has won store of value. It just has. It doesn\u2019t need to do anything else to fulfill its destiny of being digital gold. Ethereum is by far the most robust of the Web3.0 experiments, but it\u2019s got a lot of competition coming, and it feels to me as if it\u2019s still a few years away from really being truly robust.For Ethereum to be a great investment, two things have to happen: It has to be a significant part of the Web 3.0 fabric in three or four years \u2014 it\u2019s gotta win \u2014 but it also has to be seen as money. That\u2019s a big ask. I just said Bitcoin had store of value, is seen as money, gold. And we\u2019re gonna have payment coins \u2014 Facebook\u2019s gonna put one out, Telegram\u2019s gonna put one out \u2014 which I think will be robust and people will be comfortable with. So, creating Web 3.0, that process is billions of transactions, that\u2019s worth something. But you don\u2019t get to the stratospheric valuations that everyone\u2019s in crypto for unless that processing engine becomes money. There\u2019s not a surety that that happens.The valuation gap between what you\u2019ve seen between Web 3.0 projects and Bitcoin is there for a reason. I think it persists for a few more years. It doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not invested \u2014 what\u2019s going on with Ethereum and these Web 3.0 projects is more culturally, politically, economically, and societally relevant than anything else happening in blockchain.Your take on the institutional herd entering the space has guided the industry. How do you see this phenomenon developing in 2019?We\u2019re gonna need to see a shift of mindset. Listen, once Facebook gets involved, it sends a big message to all the endowments and pensions: \u2018Hey, the biggest players in the world are getting involved, we better too.\u2019 As they come in, they\u2019re heading straight to Bitcoin and Ethereum.When you talk to all the smartest people in Silicon Valley, Ethereum is their favorite project. They love Bitcoin, but they think Ethereum has the best developers, best community, Joe [Lubin] does a very good job of articulating the message. But its challenge is that we\u2019re still a ways away from being operationally efficient. There\u2019s a nice roadmap, let\u2019s hope people follow it. But for you to get the big valuations, you gotta be seen as money.Ethereal Summit is this weekend! Tickets are still availableWhat are you planning on addressing this year at Ethereal Summit NY?We had a speculative bubble in 2016\u20132017, and then we had a crash \u2014 for a lot of reasons. Coming out of that crash, I\u2019m going to talk about how I see the various elements and what gets wrapped together in our space \u2014 blockchain, cryptocurrency, it\u2019s all one big space. From store of value to Web 3.0 to payments to the digital world of VR/AR, gaming, there are multiple themes starting to develop which I think are going to have very different price patterns than what happened in 2016, when everything broadly correlated with each other. In 2016\u20132017, it all kind of went up because every project was claiming to be a store of value. The reality is, everything can\u2019t be a store of value, otherwise, it\u2019s the classic supply conundrum: anyone can throw more supply into the market, and then the whole market collapses. That\u2019s what we had.Your talks at Ethereal have reached legendary status. What\u2019s your history with the event and ConsenSys like?I would not have been an Ethereum investor if it wasn\u2019t for walking into the ConsenSys office in late 2015 when ETH was trading under a dollar. I think Joe\u2019s built one of the most important companies in the whole blockchain space, certainly the most important company in the Ethereum space. When ConsenSys asked me to show up and talk at Ethereal Summit, I was more than happy to. It\u2019s been a lot of fun. I remember the first time, looking around the room and thinking: \u2018I\u2019m the only investor in here!\u2019 There were a lot of young kids, new speculators, programmers and coders, entrepreneurs, brilliant people, but really no one was an investor. I thought I had something to add to the conversation.When I went to the second Ethereal in San Francisco, I told a different story about the community self-policing itself. One of the beauties of a crypto community is: If it sucks, the price goes down. If it\u2019s good, the price goes up. If you\u2019re a good participant, you\u2019re helping your investment. At that point, I had seen a lot of shady stuff in the industry, and I think a lot of that contributed to regulators rushing in, the speculative frenzy, and the subsequent sell-off. To be fair, for me, it wasn\u2019t hard to sell when I saw stuff that got me worried. I\u2019ve spent my life selling.Join the conversation when Ethereal Summit NY takes place at Pioneer Works in Brooklyn, May 10\u201311th.What\u2019s the major divergence in investment strategies in digital assets with all this in mind?When I go to the west coast, they look at me like \u2014 \u2018You can\u2019t sell! What if you sold Facebook? You\u2019d be a fool!\u2019 I think this is a very different regime. We are so far from real implementation of this stuff, and we were getting liquidity before we normally would in a venture cycle. There, you\u2019re not going public for 7, 8, 9 years after you start the company. In crypto, we\u2019re getting liquidity so early that when prices drastically increase, you can sell them, wait, and buy back later. The venture community has a hard time with that mindset. I think it\u2019s the advantage of being hybrid Venture/Wall Street New Yorkers. Crypto isn\u2019t a venture product. And it\u2019s not just a currency. It\u2019s somewhere in between. I look at this stuff as venture with early liquidity.So will we ever see a token-and-liquidity driven market again? Is that a good or a bad thing?I don\u2019t see any token mania taking place again any time soon. Partly because the regulators in the US are making it really hard \u2014 they don\u2019t want retail participating in unstructured deals with little due diligence. There was a frenzy, it was just a speculative frenzy, pass the parcel. People made money, lost money, but that wasn\u2019t good for capital markets or crypto capital markets. It was necessary, but it wasn\u2019t necessarily healthy. Regulators are going to be much tougher going forward. You\u2019re not gonna see you and I launching \u2018Colored Marker Coin,\u2019 and it being worth a billion dollars. That chapter has come and closed.Disclaimer.

Something was causing it to run in \u201coffline\u201d mode and not detect to the injected web3.

We\u2019re excited by the number of talented teams working collaboratively to build a decentralized and open internet. The purpose of the grants program is to allow teams to build cool technology. The Web3 Foundation is happy to fund the project if it falls within our areas of interest. Check out a non-exhaustive list of ideas that we would consider providing grants for here.Today we have the pleasure of announcing the first round of grants we funded. We believe that each of the winners will be providing something unique and important to the ecosystem. Moreover, each project will be open source and therefore free for anyone to use.More funding is available, so we kindly welcome more teams to step forward and submit their ideas. Details of how to apply can be found on our grants page, but we have also included a quick recap below.Winning teamsOne of the themes that stands out with these grants is our commitment to making new user on boarding as easy as possible. A Polkadot wallet is a gateway to the Web3 ecosystem: they can provide features such as staking, governance, and identity across multiple chains.An open source block explorer and an open source scalable cluster are also important pieces of any decentralized blockchain ecosystem. We want the community to have the tools they need to verify chain data (let\u2019s not blindly trust!), as well as, having the ability to deploy a local solution for handling requests to a dApp (you don\u2019t need to rely upon a single company!).Finally, there are also a number of projects that relate to improving the security, posture, and performance of our technology.Chainhammer \u2014 Multi-chain performance testing tool (GitHub)ChainSafe \u2014 Polkadot Runtime Environment in Go (via an RFP) (GitHub)Soramitsu \u2014 Polkadot Runtime Environment in C++ (via an RFP) (GitHub)OpenNetSys \u2014 Polkadot Runtime Environment in Go (via an RFP) (GitHub)Polkascan \u2014 Open Source Block Explorer (GitHub)Polkawallet \u2014 Mobile Wallet (GitHub)Validators \u2014 Open Source Scalable Cluster (GitHub)Enzyme \u2014 Browser extension walletSpeckle OS \u2014 Browser extension wallet (GitHub)Noise Explorer \u2014 Rust code generator for formally verified (Noise/ cryptographic) handshakes (GitHub)Protos \u2014 Open Source Node ExplorerSupercomputing Systems \u2014 Substrate Transaction Privacy using Intel SGX (GitHub)This is just the start of what we know will be many waves of grants!Future GrantsNew teams are applying weekly, and should these teams be accepted, then they will appear in the next wave blog post. We predict that we will continue funding grants at least until the end of the year and are looking forward to receiving applications from more teams.While our grants are targeted towards tighter timescales and smaller scopes, we can easily fund a piece of a larger project. Here are some ideas to get you thinking:How can we make deployment of nodes easier?How can we help to improve the adoption of decentralized systems within society? For example, do you want to build something that relates to identity, oracles, smart contracts, or asset tokenization?Please reach out and let us know if you are interested and willing to build on these ideas (grants@web3.foundation).The application processWe hope that the above list of winners has inspired you to get involved. As a reminder, here is an overview of the application process.Read the information at http://grants.web3.foundationOpen the Google Form and fill in the relevant information (all teams are required to enter information here).Make a pull request to the repo (if you are submitting a public application).The grants editor reviews all applications to ensure that the necessary level of information was included. Changes may be requested.After a number of grant applications have been made, the grants committee will review the latest batch of applications and decide whether to provide funding or not.Important grant application aspectsJust before you rush ahead and make an application, let us provide a few pointers on what grants are for. The following criteria apply to all applications. Grant funding may not be correct for all teams, but it should be a good choice for a number of early stage projects.Application should fit with our areas of interest.Code must have an open source license.Maximum funding available is $100k.Grants are not investments, but they are a source of non-dilutive funding.Our budget is limited so grants can not sustain a business in the long run.Time horizon is ideally 3 months or less.The most important part of the application is the roadmap. Please make this detailed and show the cost of each individual milestone within the roadmap.It is understood that developer costs vary worldwide; however, we expect the cost calculations in the roadmap to be reasonable and commensurate for your place of operations.Get in touchShould you have any questions about the grants process then feel free to reach out: grants@web3.foundationWe also have Riot channels for real-time discussions on Web3 and Polkadot:Web3 FoundationPolkadot Watercooler", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Polkadot", "Polkadot Network", "Grant"]}, {"title": "Messaging for Web 3.0: Building an Anonymous Messaging Protocol", "post_link": "https://medium.com/web3foundation/messaging-for-web-3-0-building-an-anonymous-messaging-protocol-e29db72f4d19?source=search_post", "author_name": "Web3 Foundation Team", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@web3", "publish_date": "2019-01-09", "last_modified_date": "2019-01-09", "readtime": "2.51", "claps": 376, "voters": 19, "content": "Messaging for Web 3.0: Building an Anonymous Messaging ProtocolWeb3 Foundation TeamFollowJan 9 \u00b7 3 min readThis blog post details the community initiative to bring messaging to Web 3.0.Private, decentralized messaging is a core component of our collective vision of Web 3.0.

The blockchain ecosystem has yet to have its \u201cNetscape moment.\u201d We believe that the underlying protocols upon which decentralized applications (dApps) rely do not have sufficient capability to enable broad adoption. One element of the problem is that dApps often require the exchange of transient messages (meaning they last only for a short time, and disappear). However, because of their immutable properties and privacy characteristics it does not make sense to transmit these transient messages via a blockchain. Gavin Wood realized this problem in the early days of Ethereum, and suggested that dApps would require a decentralized messaging protocol that would provide this capability. This protocol is called Whisper.Unfortunately, despite the rapid advancement of dApps the evolution and adoption of Whisper has been stunted. The lack of development to meet the needs of the blockchain ecosystem means that Whisper is not able to provide the scaling dApps require. At the same time, it is not feasible for projects to create their own bespoke messaging protocols. What the ecosystem needs is a new protocol to handle transient messaging at scale. We believe that the vision of Web 3.0 and the ability for dApps to go mainstream necessitates us building a new, decentralized privacy-preserving communication protocol.ProjectWe would like to gather a number of projects together to align and support this protocol:ResearchersAcademiaWeb 3.0 projectsProtocol implementersCore dev teams from Web 3 spaceApplication buildersUser messaging applicationState channelsLatency-agnostic streaming protocolsOther applications requiring transient messagingThe goal is to end up with at least one viable implementation, specification and a theoretical analysis of the protocol properties.The Web3 Foundation (W3F) has started gathering requirements and aligning on goals, meeting with a number of projects to better understand what the needs are.ContributorsStatusValidity LabsWeb3 FoundationRequirementsEnsuring Metadata protection:Sender Anonymity (who sent a message?)Receiver Anonymity (who read a message?)Sender-Receiver Unlinkability (who is talking to whom?)Convenience, Usability:4.

In the next tutorial (Part 2), we will cover the registration of a Ticker as well as viewing your previously registered Ticker symbols. If you only want to view the code, click here for the github repo.Note: Before you get started, please make sure that you have Metamask installed and unlocked on your preferred browser. You may also need to grab some Kovan TestNet ETH. You can follow instructions to get Kovan TestNet ETH here: https://faucet.kovan.networkGetting started with React and web3We can quickly scaffold by executing the following commands where project-name is whatever you\u2019d like to name your project folder:npm i -g create-react-app create-react-app {project-name}cd {project-name}Now let\u2019s install web3 which is a \u201ccollection of libraries which allow you to interact with a local or remote Ethereum node, using a HTTP or IPC connection\u201d. Essentially, it provides a Javascript API for us to access the smart contract through a web interface. We\u2019ll be using web3 1.0.x for this tutorial.We\u2019ll also install reactstrap to assist with displaying and improving the user-interfacenpm i web3 --savenpm i bootstrap --savenpm i reactstrap --saveNote: In order to use bootstrap, you need to add the following import to yourindex.js file: `import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';Edit your src/App.js to import web3 and within componentDidMount() you can access web3 as follows:Note: Make sure that you have Metamask installed and unlocked.Now if you executeyarn start from the command line then you will see your selected Metamask account\u2019s Eth Address. You can also clone the \u201cstep1\u201d branch of this repo.Connecting to Smart ContractsWe will connect to the TestNet (Kovan) deployment of the PolyToken contract which we can find by checking etherscan for its deployed address here: 0xB06d72a24df50D4E2cAC133B320c5E7DE3ef94cB. Go to the \u201cCode\u201d tab and copy the \u201cContract ABI\u201d. This interface is in a JSON-format and provides us with access to the smart contract\u2019s functions.Note: The PolyToken contract can be accessed via the TickerRegistry contract but we\u2019ll cover that in the next article.Now, within the src folder of your app, let\u2019s do the following:mkdir contracts && cd contractstouch PolyTokenFaucet.jsonEdit the PolyTokenFaucet.json to the following:{  \"contractName\": \"PolyTokenFaucet\",  \"abi\": /** Paste the full ABI here **/}Let\u2019s go back to src/App.js and import the PolyTokenFaucet contract as well as connect to it and check our POLY balance. Update src/App.js as follows:Now you have your POLY balance displayed within the app. You can confirm this balance by adding the PolyToken to your Metamask account under accounts. You can do so by clicking \u201cAdd Token\u201d under your Metamask account (in \u201cTokens\u201d section).If you don\u2019t have any POLY at the moment, let\u2019s call the getTokens() function from the PolyToken contract. The getTokens() function accepts two parameters:_amount (uint256) \u2014 the amount of POLY to be sent_recipient (String) \u2014 the ETH address which will receive the POLYUpdate your src/App.js to include a form so that you can set how much POLY you\u2019d like to grab.Run yarn start again and you should successfully be able to grab TestNet POLY after updating the request POLY field and confirming the Metamask transaction. In part 2 of this tutorial, we\u2019ll refactor this code to include the TickerRegistry smart contract so that we can register our own Ticker symbol!Are you looking for the full code?

Their latest release, 1.1, includes privacy and permissioning features as well as an improved consensus algorithm, IBFT 2.0. The PegaSys team will release v1.2 on July 31st, which includes privacy improvements, permissioning UI, and EthSigner/key management. They\u2019re gearing up for an even bigger release with v1.3 in October. From interoperability to Java tooling, here are a few reasons why Ethereum developers migrating to Pantheon.Mainnet Compatibility\u201cLiquidShare is an industry-changing technology for equities markets and a powerful example of Ethereum\u2019s enterprise-readiness. The collaboration with PegaSys shows the power of Pantheon, its enterprise features, and the growing interest in using an Enterprise Ethereum built for mainnet compatibility.\u201d\u2013Thibaud de Maintenant, CEO of LiquidShareEveryone hates technical debt, and every tool that you add contributes exponentially to it, while also complicating maintenance of your solution. With Pantheon, there\u2019s no need to learn a separate mainnet and private network client. Pantheon is mainnet compatible, so for developers, learning Pantheon is enough to cover both your public and private network needs.Safety Without Silos: Why Businesses Will Learn to Love Public Ethereum - CoinDeskJohn Wolpert leads Web3Studio, a unit of ConsenSys. Before joining ConsenSys in 2017, he served as the global product\u2026www.coindesk.comHigh-Quality DocumentationPantheon was designed and built from scratch, allowing us to learn from all the accomplishments and challenges of other Ethereum clients. Pantheon is accelerating time-to-market for users by leaving room to optimize for the developer experience.The PegaSys team has also prepared high-quality docker and cloud templates (coming soon) so you can spin up a node at the click of a button for testing and demonstration. These docker images are updated regularly with their latest software and serve as great demos for the product.PegaSys\u2019 extensive documentation includes quickstart guides and tutorials that describe the product and features in detail so you can access capabilities easily and find answers quickly. The team\u2019s documentation also includes high-level diagrams and explanations, as well as in-detail references of new enterprise features like privacy and permissioning.Lastly, PegaSys\u2019 responsive and globally distributed team is supporting users across channels\u2013\u2013Github, Gitter, email\u2013\u2013and time zones.Enterprise-Friendly\u201cTreum is in the business of bringing transparency, traceability, and tradability to supply chains, using blockchain technology. Integrating with Pantheon, an enterprise optimized blockchain infrastructure, helps accelerate our mission to help businesses build trust with their customers.\u201d\u2013Connor Keenan, Co-Founder of TreumPantheon builds on standards specified by the world\u2019s largest blockchain consortium, the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, synthesizing the requirements of hundreds of different companies and dozens of industries. The PegaSys standards team is constantly feeding their expertise and learnings from Pantheon to the EEA membership and providing a feedback loop to keep their software up-to-date with the current EEA Client Specification.PegaSys built Pantheon with a permissive Apache 2.0 open source license to allow enterprises full flexibility to commercialize solutions built with Pantheon. The Apache 2.0 license explicitly grants commercial permission to use, modify, and sell software under it. This applies to both copyrights and patents, unlike other open source licenses. Most legal and procurement departments will sign off on Apache 2.0 licensed software without any issues.PegaSys invested deeply in enabling enterprises to harness the power of Ethereum through their features, free training, and regular tutorials and webinars. The team also offers developer support for PoCs and full production deployments of their software as required by many large enterprises.Open Source + Java CommunitiesPantheon is above all, an open source project, and draws inspiration from both the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) and public chain Ethereum communities. The work behind Pantheon\u2019s features and the standards delivered are defined by both those communities\u2019 mindsets. This includes, among other things, identical EEA and mainnet Ethereum JSON-RPC APIs, allowing developers to easily switch to a single client for both use cases, without having to worry about unilateral changes.PegaSys speaks to one of the world\u2019s most popular software engineering communities: Java. Java is the language of high-performance enterprise applications and an estimated 10 million developers around the world. We\u2019re compatible with key Java tooling like JMX, Spring, Camel, and Prometheus. The team uses them on a daily basis for our work on Pantheon. If you\u2019d like more information on why we chose Java, check out our article, \u201cWhy Java for Blockchain.\u201dWhy Java for BlockchainHere\u2019s why PegaSys chose Java for its new Ethereum client.media.consensys.netFull Suite of Features: IBFT 2.0, Orion, and MorePantheon is customer-driven, and our roadmap builds towards the needs and requirements of a wide variety of users including both EEA and Ethereum Foundation stakeholders.With the help of a Gitcoin bounty and the PegaSys community, we recently built a GraphQL API interface implementation.

We are actively accepting applications on a rolling basis. The grants program will be around for all of 2019 and most likely continue through 2020. Once Polkadot has launched, it will still be important to assist in funding teams to get their projects started within our ecosystem.Astute observers may have noticed that the previous two wave blogs had a regular cadence. We had a plan to announce teams at the end of every quarter. With DotCon and the Web 3 Summit just around the corner, we wanted to announce the latest winners just in time.If you are interested in applying for a Web3 Foundation grant then you will be happy to know that more funding is available, so we kindly welcome more teams to apply and tell us about their ideas. Details of how to apply can be found on our grants page.Winners from the previous waves can be seen in the corresponding blogs: Wave One and Wave TwoRecipientsWithin each wave of teams there tends to be themes that link the different teams together. This is generally by accident than design. We notice that some teams submit an idea after seeing a similar idea appear in a pull request on our grants repo. This time round, it seems that the strongest themes are \u2018security\u2019 and \u2018identity\u2019.Supercomputing systems \u2014 Substrate Rust API client (GitHub)NGRAVE \u2014 Substrate Hardware Wallet IntegrationCaelum Labs \u2014 Decentralised identity modulesRuntime Verification \u2014 Build executable K specifications of the SRML (GitHub)Attic Lab \u2014 VS Code and Atom plugins (GitHub)Dock \u2014 Verifiable ClaimsBlockdaemon \u2014 Polkadot Package Manager (GitHub)Zondax \u2014 Ledger app for Polkadot (GitHub)Geefu \u2014 Vue JS components for Polkadot JS apps (GitHub)Centrifuge \u2014 Substrate Go API client (GitHub)Litentry \u2014 Identity modules and corresponding UIs (GitHub)SubSocial \u2014 SRML and UI for decentralized communities (GitHub)pLibra \u2014 Bridge between Polkadot and a Libra chain (GitHub)Wiv \u2014 Supply chain modules and front-end UI (GitHub)Future GrantsWe intend to continue awarding grants until the end of this year and probably into 2020, so it\u2019s never too late to apply! Take a look at our areas of interest to get a general idea of what we are interested in funding. Below, we outline some of the more high-priority projects we are looking to support.The design and implementation of bridges to all major blockchains is one of our highest priorities. Please check out our newly-released RFP in this area.Currently, the only way to generate a Polkadot Runtime is by using Rust along with Parity-built tools. We would like to increase the language options for developers to write these Runtimes and recently released an RFP for the development of a tool to generate WebAssembly Runtimes from AssemblyScript.Other developer tooling that\u2019s important includes tools for improved or simplified parachain development, editor or IDE integration and mobile libraries.Tools which improve the security and usability of nodes are also a priority. This includes projects such as compatible hardware security modules, node monitoring services, and validator setup tools.Lastly, we would love to get proposals for the development of stable coins, as well as, new types of blockchains that can act as parachains. Of course, these are just some selected ideas, not an exhaustive list. If you would like to work on another interesting project, feel free to apply!How to Deliver MilestonesIn our previous blog, Wave 2, we gave an overview of our main criteria for grants plus we gave an idea of how to structure a roadmap. That is the best advice we can give to new teams.After the roadmap, the next most important aspect of the program is the delivery of milestones. We do ask teams to give us a good indication of how to test their software when they write their roadmap, but how to deliver the milestones requires some more exploration.A quick checklist:Check that all items listed in the roadmap are being delivered.Ensure that the code compiles and runs without any errors.

Day 2 Summary: DApp Developers Deliberating Sensible Scaling SolutionsWeb3 Foundation TeamFollowApr 6, 2018 \u00b7 8 min readIn our previous post we summarised the scaling solutions that are available for use today or in the near future. Developing a solution is one of two important pieces in the scaling puzzle. The second piece of the puzzle is to grasp the needs of businesses and organisations who rely upon blockchain technology and to better understand why and how they\u2019ll utilise these platforms.In this article we will recap our findings from the second day of the ScalingNow! Event in Barcelona.On day 2, we sat down with a number of DApp developers to understand the scaling problems that they are currently facing. Interestingly, although perhaps unsurprisingly, teams working on disparate problems have the exact same problem areas when it comes to scaling.The main issues facing DApp developersDApp developers are greatly concerned with user experience. All of the developers we spoke to were worried about the responsiveness of their apps and the cost of performing on-chain operations. Users want DApps to respond as quickly as web applications: they have become accustomed to feature rich and fast responding \u201cweb 2\u201d applications; however, such response times are tricky to achieve in the current web 3 landscape where Ethereum (for example) has 15 second blocktimes.Despite the importance of speed, all of the developers we spoke to did not want to sacrifice cost for speed, nor speed for cost. Fast response times with an incredibly high cost wouldn\u2019t be profitable or desireable. Conversely, long response times that are incredibly cheap just aren\u2019t feasible from a user satisfaction perspective.Without a scaling solution, DApp developers essentially had to pick one or the other: low-costs or low-response times. Such a situation is unworkable in the longer term if we are to see the success of a fully fledged web 3 ecosystem. Fortunately, the scaling solutions as presented in our previous article show promise of being able to dampen the impact of the cost vs speed conundrum.Project Summaries \u2014 Decentralised ApplicationsAragonWhat: Aragon is a platform to run DAOs. The Aragon Network is a digital jurisdiction.Time to release: Version 0.5 has launched.Key problems: Aragon want DAOs to be deployed by people who need them (e.g people in developing countries who can\u2019t afford transactions that cost $100). Voting must happen on chain (for governance) which hits the throughput bottleneck. To achieve these goals they need high throughput and low transaction costs.Favoured solutions: The team have considered a POA network with a Parity Bridge to Ethereum. They have also considered Witnet (project not presented at ScalingNOW!). A POA network may help them scale in the near term, even if that only means a 10x or 100x improvement, and provides a runway to scale further. No timeline was given for when a near-term scaling solution will be implemented. Aragon have a desire to see cross-chain communication in order to have as big of an ecosystem as possible, and in that regard they are keenly awaiting the arrival of the Polkadot Network. If there is too much communication across the bridges, then it could decrease throughput.An interesting alternative to help bridge the gap is the use of an optimistic UI update: update the UI before it is actually confirmed. This trick will help to give the illusion of a faster response time and improve user experience.DecenterWhat: Decenter\u2019s team has a mission is to build decentralized applications and protocols for the Web. Their current focus is a project named Selenean, a game frameworks on the Ethereum blockchain. The vision is to build games as truly decentralized applications to enable fully serverless gameplay.Time to release: The team is close to launching a single player game on a testnet \u2014 this should go live in the next few weeks. Longer term, they have a plan to design a trading card game framework supporting P2P gameplay using a counterfactually instantiated state channel solution.Key problems: The biggest challenges are block times and transaction costs on the mainnet. Paying for each turn of the game is expensive for the player and would cause a lot of friction.Favoured solutions: The team\u2019s ideal solution would be to minimise the interaction with the blockchain as well as costs involved. For a single player game they have mitigated some of the pain points by deferring update of the game: instead of forcing the player to record every move, the contract can parse a long set of moves, thus allowing the player to save the state of their game (and keep score) less frequently and at their convenience. As for the multiplayer game framework, they are looking to build their own implementation of counterfactually instantiated state channels. This approach looks to solve both the issue of cost and hassle to the user by minimizing interaction as well as providing peer-to-peer real time gameplay not dependent on block times on the mainnet (or sidechain).DragonereumWhat: Dragonereum is a crypto-collectible player vs. player game whereby users can own, trade, breed, and fight other dragons while collecting rewards and achievements along the way.The aim is to build the \u201cfirst truly decentralized digital scarcity game where developers control as little as possible\u201d.The community will have the ability to verify all transactions and actions without the requirement to rely on any trusted third party.Their team will gradually pass decision making over to our users, who can use in-game currency as a token for governance.Time to release: < 1 monthKey problems: Transaction gas cost and block time is too high for real time games.Favoured Solutions: Planning to use sidechain (poa.network or loomx.io) as a short term solution, but for a long term the team are waiting for sharding or Plasma. The believe that sidechains can resolve scalability and transaction costs problem, but questions about decentralization arise.LivePeerWhat: LivePeer are providing a P2P video streaming service. LivePeer have a studio in Berlin which is publishing video 24/7.Time to release: Deployed on testnet, but mainnet is a couple months away.Key problems: The team are worried about the Ethereum block time being too long and the cost being too high. Ideally, video would go out to all viewers immediately rather than having to wait 30\u201340 seconds. Obviously, long waiting times provide a poor user experience.Currently, the team have a deployment on the Rinkeby testnet, but want to release a beta product onto the mainnet within a couple of months. The incentivising protocol was stated as being \u201cpretty complex\u201d which is a problem for on-chain calculation. This is why they need scaling now!Favoured solutions: Working closely with the TrueBit team on scaling the computation process. It solves part of the problem, but they are still learning about the other scaling solutions to increase throughput and how to make transactions cheaper.Parsec LabsWhat: Parsec\u2019s mission is to bring fairness and transparency to the gaming and entertainment industry. We enable on-chain scalability for game execution to open up and unite virtual worlds.Their product is a bridge, which connects gaming to blockchain. It consists of a Plasma-enabled sidechain and an API.Time to release: 5 months.Key problems: When building Acebusters, a decentralized poker platform, the team encountered several scalability issues. Even with advanced scaling solutions like state channels they were unable to satisfy the needs of users in terms of transaction throughput and cost. The team have since pivoted to building an execution venue for transactions that is fast and cheap enough for games, but that provides the same security guarantees as the Ethereum network.Favoured solutions: The solution that the team are building is a Plasma side-chain extended with general computation, enabled by the Truebit verification-game.Radar RelayWhat: A decentralised exchange built on top of 0x protocol. Bulletin board where users come and sign intents for trade orders.Time to release: Live.Key problems: The team stated that once they hit throughput capacity on Ethereum their project will slow down, but they are looking ahead and would like to deploy a scaling solution ahead of being hit with the throughput cap. Radar Relay point out that throughput affects user experience, but there is no point overpaying for fast execution.Favoured solutions: Radar Relay have a keen interest in cross-chain access. The team express an interest in exploring state channels but are more interested in \u201cparachain\u201d type solutions (e.g. Cosmos and Polkadot). They are currently working with the Cosmos team and they also have an in-house researcher looking at how to use the Cosmos scaling solution. The team are testing Cosmos to see if it is production ready.Radar Relay are interested in the possibility of using the Polkadot Network in the future. The plan is to test the best-in-class solutions before they are published, such that Radar Relay is ready for day-one of the solution being launched.We wish to extend our thanks to the @Giveth teaming for helping to co-organise this event with us (@Web3Foundation).

To balance these sometimes competing goals, we\u2019ve opted for a sponsorship-free event that we hope will break even.Quick Links:Web3Summit.comBuy your ticketApply for a discounted ticketApply to host a workshopApply to stake out a hackerspaceApply to volunteer for 1 day and to get free access to the rest of the event (and a T-shirt :)Earlier this year the Web3 Foundation set out to create the first Web3 Summit. As anyone who has worked on a summit or conference will confirm, producing a 3-day event with 1000+ attendees, 40+ speakers, 20+ workshops, and 24/7 hackerspaces is a colossal undertaking. But we\u2019re determined to achieve our goals and deliver on our mission: to create a web where users control their own money, data, identity and destiny, and we see collaboration as a fundamental driver of the Web3 movement.Our primary and most important goal for the Web3 Summit is to create a platform for all decentralized technologies to gather and collaborate. Web3 Summit widens the umbrella and invites both competing blockchain technologies and non-blockchain technologies. Working together on a shared vision is the only way we, the users, can retake control over our digital sovereignty. Learn more about these technologies by viewing the Web3 technology stack.To accomplish this we believe the Summit needs to be focused on the technology and the people building it. So early on in this journey we made a strategic decision to host the Web3 Summit sponsorship-free. From the outset, the Web3 Summit has been budgeted to break even. We believe hosting an event without sponsors, booths, logos, and pay-to-play speakers will create a clutter-free, clear-thinking environment so that attendees can focus on why we\u2019re all here: to build a future where we can cooperate and collaborate in trusting ways, without the need for trust in anyone to direct them, and free from interference from malicious third parties.Our other main goal is to create a participant driven and accessible event everyone in the community can attend, regardless of their current financial situation or what token they HODL. To this end we decided that we\u2019d sell two tiers of tickets and include the option to volunteer for a free ticket:1) Regular tickets: 600 euros (800 for sale)2) Discounted tickets: 300 euros (180 total)3) Volunteers & contributors: Free (96 total)We project the total cost of the Summit to be around 550,000 euros. We project ticket sales and donations will amount to the same. This is how we break even and create a sustainable model to host future events and summits.Ideally, we\u2019d host a free event (like our workshops and meetups) where everyone who wants to attend is able to. This is an experiment, and we are open to other models. Perhaps next year we do accept sponsorships and make the Web3 Summit totally free for attendees, while the Foundation still breaks even. This year we are eager to see how a sponsorship-free event will affect the atmosphere and attendees\u2019 ability to gain value from the Summit.Thank you for reading this far. We hope this summary of the Web3 Foundation\u2019s thinking and decision-making around the Summit helps make clear our commitment to create a forum for you to develop and develop on Web3.

We\u2019re excited by the number of talented teams working collaboratively to build a decentralized and open internet. Check out a non-exhaustive list of ideas that we would consider providing grants for here.Today we are proud to issue our second grant to Soramitsu! Soramitsu will develop the next node implementation of the Polkadot Runtime Environment (PRE) in the C++ programming language. The PRE C++ implementation is called Kagome, and Soramitsu is planning to release Kagome by August 2019.Soramitsu is the fourth announced team working on core Polkadot technology. Parity Technologies is building the first implementation of Polkadot in Rust, Polkadot JS in JavaScript and ChainSafe Systems in Golang. With this announcement, there are now over 120 developers across North America, Europe, and Asia working towards delivering a robust, secure, and resilient Polkadot ecosystem.Polkadot & Enterprise AdoptionWeb3 Foundation chose Soramitsu to build the next Polkadot Runtime Environment because of their extensive development capabilities and their work with global enterprises. Soramitsu is one of the largest blockchain development companies in Asia, focusing on delivering blockchain-based solutions for enterprises, universities, and governments. Developing a Polkadot implementation will allow Soramitsu to better serve their existing enterprise customers.The Polkadot Runtime Environment will allow us to build new use cases for the payment infrastructure we are developing for large financial institutions like the National Bank of Cambodia. \u2014 Makoto Takemiya, Co-Founder and Co-CEO of SoramitsuSoramitsu is the original developer of Hyperledger Iroha, a next-generation permissioned platformed aimed at helping businesses and financial institutions manage digital identity and assets. The team contributed the original codebase for Hyperledger Iroha to the Linux Foundation\u2019s Hyperledger Project. Polkadot will allow Hyperledger Iroha to talk to any other network and plug enterprise solutions into global financial and identity infrastructures.As discussed in Soramitsu\u2019s press release, solutions like Polkadot are extremely important for their enterprise work in the future. Soramitsu is implementing the Sora Decentralized Autonomous Economy, D3Ledger, and a payment system for the National Bank of Cambodia, all of which use HyperLedger Iroha as their distributed ledger platform. Polkadot will allow them to link all of these projects together. This is important because enterprises and financial institutions have a tendency to build isolated systems that fail to reach their full potential because of a lack of interoperability and having a negative impact on user experience.Additionally, the Soramitsu team works with a number of major corporations that benefit from open source as use case partners for Hyperledger Iroha, including Honda, Hitachi, Panasonic, and Sony Financial Holdings.Polkadot in C++ (Kagome)Soramitsu has chosen to develop a PRE in C++ because of the maturity of the developer ecosystem and enterprise requirements for high performance and reliability. There are already a lot of projects and software written for C++ and enterprises are familiar with it. This contributes to the large pool of developer talent in the C++ ecosystem, estimated to be around 4.4 million developers with proficiency in the language, versus tens of thousands coding in Golang or Rust.What is the Polkadot Runtime Environment (PRE)?As mentioned in the Golang implementation announcement, the PRE is a framework for developing standalone blockchains and connecting them to the Polkadot network. A PRE can also make the development of parachains on Polkadot easier by providing reusable components including: a networking layer (libp2p), a consensus layer (e.g. Aurand/GRANDPA), a Wasm interpreter, and APIs for user and node interaction. As part of this grant Soramitsu will develop the C++ implementation of the libp2p networking layer. This is the only funding in the world going towards a C++ implementation of libp2p.Unlike the Ethereum blockchain, where these two core components are the same, the Polkadot Runtime Environment is distinct from the Polkadot Runtime. This is intended to improve the modularity of the protocol. The necessary features are shown in the lower layers of the following diagram:Why Build Multiple Implementations?As a recap from the Golang implementation announcement, it is critically important to have multiple implementations of the Polkadot protocol for a number of reasons, including decentralization, knowledge dispersion, and better definitions of the protocol.Multiple implementations of Polkadot improves network resilience and adds to the decentralization of the network. The governance of the network is more democratized when multiple teams build clients which run the nodes in the network. By building a the next implementation of the Polkadot protocol, Soramitsu is helping develop a robust network \u2014 meaning that if there\u2019s an issue with one client, it won\u2019t impact network availability \u2014 thus ensuring a healthy, resilient Polkadot ecosystem.Through this grant, W3F hopes to increase the number of people and projects that are intimately familiar with the Polkadot protocol and tap into a mature and large developer ecosystem. By opening up Polkadot to the C++ developer community, more people will be able to understand the core Polkadot technology. W3F\u2019s goal is to make Polkadot core technology into a commodity so that it is accessible and more people can build solutions and join in on discussion around protocol upgrades and research.Grant ProcessWeb3 Foundation announced the RFP for alternative implementations of the Polkadot Runtime Environment in July 2018. At that time we stated our preferred language was Go, followed by C++ and Java. As a result we received a number of proposals and ultimately decided to move forward with Soramitsu (C++), ChainSafe Systems (Golang) and one other team, to be announced soon.

For a recap of the discussions prior to the workshop, please read the previous blog post. Hitherto, most communication protocols for such applications have failed to adequately protect user privacy. We came together to review existing work, discuss shortcomings and the design of a new privacy-preserving communication service that address these shortcomings. This blog summarizes the workshop outcomes.MotivationWe\u2019ve had decentralized applications since the 1990s, which were historically called peer-to-peer (P2P) apps, with the most well known being file-sharing services like BitTorrent, and some privacy networks like I2P. We recently witnessed an explosion of decentralized applications in the form of \u201cdApps\u201d on blockchain networks such as Ethereum. Some of these dApps have several thousands users. Examples include browsers like Status, exchanges like IDEX, games like Funfair, social networks like Peepeth, prediction services like Gnosis, and storage services like Filecoin. In this blog post, we focus on dapps in the context of blockchains.A key advantage of decentralized applications is that they avoid the pressures to censor faced by centralized applications. At the same time, decentralized applications inherently require stronger privacy measures, and thus more complexity, because they lack any universally trusted party. We do not consider this a disadvantage and an increasing numbers of users dislike trusting centralized parties, too.Aside from protecting message content, we should protect message metadata as well because this metadata reveals inordinate amounts of private information. Almost any performant scheme for protecting network level metadata requires \u201conion encryption,\u201d meaning packets pass through several relays, each of which deforms the outgoing packet so that it is \u201cunlinkable\u201d to the incoming one. Figure 1 depicts an abstract example for a communication system that protects user\u2019s metadata, with two senders, two receivers, and four relays that forward the incoming messages until it reaches the receivers. An adversary should not be able to track a message through the system.Figure 1: A simple privacy-preserving communication tool that intends to disguise which sender is sending a message to the receivers.Don\u2019t we have existing tools already?Over the last three decades, a range of communication systems were proposed to protect user privacy, including network level metadata. Yet, only a handful were properly designed and built, while even fewer have seen much adoption. Next, we shortly review two classic privacy-preserving tools: Tor and Mixnets. However, they are not churn-friendly. Churn plays an important role in improving scalability and is a key feature we are taking into account. An example of a churn-friendly privacy-preserving communication tool is Whisper, which we review thereafter.Tor is the most commonly used privacy-preserving communication tool with about 2 million daily users. Examples of dApps using Tor for privacy-preserving communication are Briar, Ricochet, and its group communication extension CwtchIn Tor, the communication initiators choose how the communication is going to be routed through the Tor network. As a result, all Tor relays must be known by all clients, which imposes a significant cost on the network. Tor tunnels arbitrary TCP traffic, but TCP streams cannot tolerate adding latency. Tor adds no cover traffic because cover traffic has no clear impact without additional latency. Moreover, Tor is not adding any delays to the communication which is why it is categorized usually as low-latency. As a result, Tor is only secure against an adversary with local reach and who does not apply statistical methods to analyzing network traffic.Mixnets are the pioneering design for protecting network level metadata. These schemes \u201cmix\u201d packets by delaying and/or batching them, which disrupts an adversary\u2019s ability to analyze traffic, especially when used in conjunction with cover traffic. Hence, mixnets are usually categorized as high-latency systems. In the past the latency was several hours, however, recent designs have more reasonable latencies. Almost all mixnet designs, especially the deployed ones like Mixminion and Loopix, have the same issue as Tor in that communication initiators need to have complete knowledge about all relays in the system. This harms scalability.Whisper is a protocol for sending broadcast messages over the Ethereum network. It contains no sender identifier per se, but does nothing to protect senders either. It similarly does not protect receivers who respond to, or acknowledge, messages. The public and persistent nature of messages in Whisper in itself causes privacy-threats and also hinders scalability.Workshop: What did we do?We organized a workshop to plan the design and implementation of a new privacy-preserving communication service for decentralized applications.In the meetup, representatives from Status, Web3 foundation, Validity Labs, Parity Technologies, Brainbot, Matrix, Cogarius, and Caelum Labs gathered together to discuss the details of the project.We agreed on properties and features we are interested in for the system, discussed existing techniques and solutions to reach our desired features, and agreed on next steps and milestones.A summary of the features we are interested in are as follows.Anonymity for both senders and receivers \u2014 We aim at providing strong privacy guarantees, however, we have not decided on the metrics yet. Receiver anonymity was sacrificed in some recent efforts to use mixnet designs to support payment channels, which then limits scalability by preventing lite clients from recognizing their transactions\u2019 progress. We aim at addressing receiver anonymity too.Strong adversary model \u2014 We aim at being secure against an adversary with global reach, and who controls some relays in the system, because such adversaries have become increasingly commonplace.Adversarial contacts \u2014 We aim at supporting modes where senders and receivers are adversarial. Academic proposals including Loopix frequently omit this assumption, making them weaker than Tor\u2019s hidden services.Mid-latency \u2014 We want to allow a low-latency mode for users who are interested in privacy against a weaker adversary and a mid-latency mode for users who are interested in privacy against a weaker adversary. Explicitly, we aim at having ~5 seconds for applications that target weaker adversaries and ~10 seconds for applications that wish to be private against a stronger adversary.Strong usability \u2014 We aim to address useability for both users and developers. For example, for developers we want to provide proper documentation and make is easy to maintain and upgrade the system. For users we want to provide an easy interface and allow configurability. We have not decided yet whether we allow the users to keep history of their communication.Asynchronicity \u2014 We want to support limited store-and-forward capability because \u201cIt\u2019s an asynchronous world\u201d in which user may not be online simultaneously.Scalable \u2014 We aim at designing a highly scalable system. However, we want to avoid protocols with artificial scaling limits below 100k relays and 1 billion users.Adjustable privacy-performance tradeoffs \u2014 We aim at providing adjustable privacy, often compromises everyone, but we should provide applications with any safe adjustment options that exist. For example, we could allow for two modes, one that has strong privacy and some delay and one with lower privacy but with no added delay.Accommodate relay churn \u2014 Permit relays to join or leave the network easily. In case users need to be relays in the system this also applies to users.Incentivize relaying \u2014 Our system should recognize correct relay operation with payments in a transactable currency.Zero barriers for users \u2014 We want new users do not pay for basic services.Low overhead for users \u2014 We aim at causing low overhead for users that does not kill bandwidth or battery on mobile devices.Group messaging \u2014 We aim at supporting small scale group messaging. However, it won\u2019t be part of the main protocol but rather an extension.Ratchet compatibility \u2014 We should be compatible with forward secure encryption for messages, which may require improving MLS/TreeKEM or similar.Easy upgradability \u2014 Our system should enable upgradeability for all parts of the system.While not all details of the design are decided yet we have discussed existing concepts we want to incorporate in the system.As a minor example, we follow Loopix in allowing the users to determine the delays of their communication. Another example is that we support adversarial contacts, that is, providing sender/receiver anonymity against the receiver/sender. If we would not consider adversarial contacts we\u2019d be categorically weaker than Tor for many users, including some common financial use cases. These techniques do increase complexity and latency, so we should also support applications that bypass them for improved performance, or earlier deployment.As another example, we cannot foresee scaling beyond roughly 10k relays using a Tor-like global consensus protocol. We expect to modify Brahms, or perhaps devise some distributed-hash-table (DHT) scheme, to provide secure random relay selection both for greater scalability and to improve performance for clients.For more details about our workshop please see the workshop minutes.What is next?Completing related work analysis particularly related solutionsDescribe our incentive schemes and include security analysisClarify how data syncing is going to workEarly designs for routing model and sampling methodVirtual meetup in mid March to discuss some design decisionsPanel on Privacy-preserving Messaging in EthCC 2019 Paris", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Messaging", "Whisperv2", "Hopr", "Whisper", "Blockchain Messenger"]}, {"title": "Web3 Summit Hackerspace Debrief", "post_link": "https://medium.com/web3foundation/web3-summit-hackerspace-debrief-383a3be0d81a?source=search_post", "author_name": "Web3 Foundation Team", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@web3", "publish_date": "2018-11-02", "last_modified_date": "2018-11-02", "readtime": "5.49", "claps": 117, "voters": 10, "content": "Web3 Summit Hackerspace DebriefWeb3 Foundation TeamFollowNov 2, 2018 \u00b7 6 min readThe Web3 Summit hackerspace was conceived for the community to hack their own projects and create their own programming for Web3 Summit. In this article, we review highlights from each Node.The hackerspace massively exceeded our expectations! During the course of the three days, the community hosted over 60 gatherings across ten \u201cNodes.\u201d These comprised a combination of workshops, design classes, coding camps, ethics debates, interactive demo\u2019s, mini-hackathons, bug hunts, impromptu meetups, panel discussions, art exhibitions, virtual reality sessions and many other things we didn\u2019t even know about.Node 1: Design Thinking For BlockchainsHosted by Patara \u2014 Burak Arikan, Cenk Dolek & Engin ErdoganAt the Design Thinking for Blockchains workshop, participants worked on a protocol idea for a decentralized education system focused on organized events. They modeled a decentralized ledger to keep verifiable records of continuous support interactions between Instructors and Students. The Node hosted a diverse group of disciplines and knowledge levels, which made the activity even more interesting and inclusive. Heated conversations took place that advocated various perspectives on incentives, transparency, verifiability, and intellectual property, all of which contributed to a memorable people-first system design exercise. The team summarised their experience here.Node 2: Nature 2.0Hosted by Garrett MacDonald, Ewald Hesse, Trent McConaghyThis Node was an oasis of calm, set amidst a small forest. Participants attended workshops and talks on the future of our natural world, addressing the specific issue of how nature will interact with humanity, in the same way as a person or a company does. Talks focused around new economic models for nature, namely, self-owning wind farms, roads that collect tolls and upgrade themselves, almost autonomously. Indeed any use case where nature can be self-sovereign, make decisions and create tangible economic value for itself. The team have created a Github repo where they will be posting bounties here.Node 3: Decentralised ArtHosted by Alexine Rodenhuis & Sam BrownThe Decentralized Art Node brought a unique voice to the Web3 Summit, where visitors were invited to shift their minds towards the more creative side of blockchain technologies. Within the node was an art exhibition curated by Alexine Rodenhuis and a collaborative drawing project led by artist Sam Brown.The exhibition, titled Collective Creativity, brought together five works of seven international artists who are examining ideas and applications of decentralisation. The artists were: Anne de Boer , Grayson Earle and The Dark Inquiry, Sarah Friend, Aaron Koblin and Daniel Massey, Cullen Miller and Gabriel Dunne .From a Monero mining software programme which collects cryptocurrency to help bail people out of jail, to a spell-casting system that scripts incantations onto the Ethereum network, each art work contributed to an expanding conversation about the potential futures of artistic practice.Whether practical or ideological, the underpinnings of each work were grounded in an ethos of collective action and purposeful distribution of power away from a singular artistic producer. Together the works presented a snapshot of an art world where creative action is communal, united and shared.Node 4: User ExperienceHosted by CONFLUX \u2014 Aqueel MohammadIn a primarily technology driven ecosystem the UX Node was hugely appreciated. The workshops and conversation ranged from the underlying system design to the technical usability and security issues around key management. Workshops were led by Iryna Nezhynska, Alex Van De Sande, The Flightplan Team (Gendry and Nas), Ronan Sandford, Matt Halthom and James Levy.Node 5: Technical TeachingsHosted by KI Decentralized \u2014 Eric Holst & Wilfried KoppThis node was the epicentre of interactive coding workshops. They not only talked about Web 3, they actually started building it and made the content available through IPFS. The hot topic was \u2018how to start your own Polkadot/Substrate node using docker.\u2019 During every session, the hosts saw the number of nodes in the telemetry rise inline with the number of attendees. Mission success!In addition, a flurry of other technical workshops tooks place. The Mist team took us through the intricacies of EIPs 1103 and 1193 and Jacques Dafflon discussed all you need to know about the ERC-777 standard.Node 6: DApp Cityhosted by Streamr \u2014 Juuso Takalainen, Eric Andrews, Miroslav Pokrovskii, Jarno Marttila, Weilei Yu & Amandine FlachsThe dApp City node was focused around theme of Smart Cities, with IoT and blockchain at its core. Topics discussed included cross-platform device identity management, the development of open vs proprietary data exchanges, protocol standards and segregation of responsibility/concern between hardware and software layers. The team at Streamr, together with Fluence and Xain, demonstrated various integrations and use cases for the Smart City 3.0 of tomorrow. They also competed for the best attended impromptu meetup against the Protocol Labs team, and won. Must have been all the free beer and goodies!Decentralize NOW!The Decentralize Now Node was a conference unto itself. Hosting close to 30 gatherings, this was a heroic effort by Griff Green and his team. If there was ever a moment during the entire Web3 Summit that you were looking for engaging and inspiring discussion, you would find it at this Node. They hosted loads of interactive demos, their famous \u2018fishbowl\u2019 discussions and held two late-night hackathons with bounties and beer, supported and sponsored by Gitcoin and bounties.network. Whatever we can decentralize was talked about: hardware, governance, development, data, ICOs, identity, oracles, internet access, commerce, justice, the lot! This was die hard decentralization at it\u2019s best!SecurityFrom bring your own code and bug hunting tournaments to a lock picking workshop attended by around 40 people. This node won the prize for most eclectic workshop, for sure! Additionally, they hosted a crowd audit (where they audited Bokkypoobah\u2019s red black binary tree and EIP 777) and on the last day they conducted the Solidified CTF in order to get the crowd hacking. There was active participation from BokkyPooBah, SigmaPrime, PaperSec, Solidstamp, Quantstamp and BeakerOS and many other members from all corners of the security community!Virtual RealityJames Levy and Julia Schofield kindly provided us with a Node to relax at and reboot, it was much needed and thoroughly enjoyed by all!SummarySuffice it to say we were totally overwhelmed by this hive of activity that took place at Web3 Summit, all of which was entirely self-driven by the community. On reflection, it reminds us how much we can achieve, given the space and the time to focus on building out the third generation of the web. The hackerspace will definitely be back in 2019!

Participants flew in from around the world to host workshops, create spaces for hacking and sharing, present their research, and demo technology that would empower others working in the open source community to further their work.The enthusiasm and contributions from the first 900+ participants of the Web3 Summit helped set the tone for an event that we hope will continue to connect and inspire the builders of the new web for years to come.To accommodate even more community organized content this year, we have expanded Summit space! Here are some changes you can expect:Our hackerspace will be open nonstop from the opening to closing ceremonies. That means 72 hours of access to self-organized hacking. We will be providing security, support, and late night pizza deliveries to those of you hacking overnight.We\u2019ve added a new studio (with space for 200 people) for larger format workshops and smaller presentations.To take advantage of the summer weather, we\u2019ll have an outdoor space to escape the technical conversations and intensity inside, and enjoy some fresh air and eats alongside the river.As much fun as we plan to have during Web3 Summit this year, it\u2019s important to remember the Summit\u2019s raison d\u2019\u00eatre. Together we are developing technology that enables a way to resist censorship, provide privacy to users, and coordinate new economic and societal models that better represent our interests. This is a massive undertaking and it requires the coordination of numerous protocols, and support of various teams.Such a large undertaking requires a value first approach. As such, the values of Web3 Summit are unwavering: we remain committed to our policy of no sponsorships, no logos, and no maximalism. All protocols, all builders, all backgrounds, all perspectives are welcome.Collaborator Applications:The Summit is an evolving experience, one that represents the collective vision of those who contribute to it.

Lipeng is presenting ChainX at an upcoming meetup in Beijing 6 December.CryptoGeek Meetup in HangzhouChainX\u2019s core developer Shiqing Guo said: \u201cNot every blockchain start-up team should be building modules from scratch. Substrate and Polkadot are pretty promising in that a lot of this work is done for you for free. ChainX will also achieve higher security due to Polkadot\u2019s pooled security. ChainX will route our mapped assets (BTC, ZEC, ETH, ERC20, ERC721, ADA etc.) into other parachains via Polkadot Relay Chain. At the same time, the original assets of the Relay Chain and other parachains can also be routed to ChainX to enjoy various crypto-asset financial services.\u201dChainX\u2019s core developer Guanghua Guo said: \u201cIn order to meet the needs of fully decentralized cross-chain transactions, a new chain embracing the light client of existing blockchains is inevitable. Low-level language Solidity as well as other blockchain script language are obviously not suitable for the increasingly complicated on-chain logic. Aside from the basic modules of blockchain (p2p network, consensus, RPC, storage etc.), we also need a more powerful high-level language with crypto development library support. Substrate just solves our problem perfectly, the design of which is inherently flexible and extensible. With Substrate, we can directly extend its Runtime modules by using high-level languages like Rust to implement light clients in WASM environment and obtain system\u2019s native execution performance at the same time. Substrate has the most advanced tech stack and the most reusable components of any developer framework, including libp2p, PBFT, Aurand, GRANDPA finality, economics, and governance. It\u2019s novel light client design will definitely help us shift to multi-chain architecture when the performance of a single chain reaches capacity. It will be much easier to implement cross-chain communication with our chains in the future.\u201dAbout Web3 FoundationThe Web3 Foundation is a Swiss foundation fostering and shepherding the cryptographically-enabled protocols that safeguard decentralization and enable the vision of Web 3.0.

FOAM was a Gold sponsor of the event alongside companies like Microsoft, Facebook, Uber, Lyft and Mapbox \u2014 all enterprises that utilize OSM data in their Web 2.0 business models. The conference was ripe with discussions about open source participation, data verification, validation and vandalism as well as debates around importing data from machine sensors.The FOAM protocol is a Web 3.0 platform providing the infrastructure for a consensus driven map based on privacy, security and decentralization. A forthcoming retrospective piece will be posted on the conference. This post is a reading list of recent material that highlights vulnerabilities in Web 2.0 mapping and geospatial data that the FOAM aims to address.To kick off this reading list the most recent news has been that since the founders of Instagram have left the company, Facebook has been prototyping a new means of mining user location data: \u201cThat means your exact GPS coordinates collected by Instagram, even when you\u2019re not using the app, would help Facebook to target you with ads and recommend you relevant content.

This story came into the limelight when a former police sheriff snooped on phone location data without a warrant, according The New York Times, via a prison technology company called LocationSmart, \u201clittle is known about how LocationSmart obtained the real-time location data on millions of Americans, how the required consent from cell user owners was obtained, and who else has access to the data.\u201d It is suspected that this data is being sold to third parties in the industries ranging from advertising, insurance and hedge funds.US cell carriers are selling access to your real-time phone location dataFour of the largest cell giants in the US are selling your real-time location data to a company that you've probably\u2026www.zdnet.comBeyond privacy concerns about personal location data, major issues have come to light regarding the digital Maps we use and rely on everyday. Google Maps has a clear monopoly and is far ahead of competitors like Apple Maps; see \u201cGoogle Maps Moat\u201d. With that, significant price hikes to their API service have been introduced to much backlash. Companies such as Mapbox offer competing services to applications that need maps and geospatial data, such as Snap Maps, Streeteasy, Citibike and the current FOAM base Map. Mapbox, along with Apple, Uber, Lyft, HERE, Microsoft and Facebook utilize and build off of OpenStreetMap, an open source map much like Wikipedia.

We [would] either like to switch off our website or\u2026gadgets.ndtv.comOpenStreetMap (OSM) is the alternative to Google and other proprietary mapping data, as an open source and collaborative mapping project which is free to use and created by millions of participants around the world. As the crowdsourced and open map gets better and better, the value of licensing proprietary mapping data from Google plummets rapidly. But what OSM currently does not do, is make it easy to enforce agreed upon truths. Because of this, verifying data and keeping up to date with old data requires a set of committed validators and *vigilant protection from vandalism*. Currently, this is subsidized by the enterprise community that is built around OSM. However, what ends up happening is that private enterprises generated a \u201cprotected\u201d version of OSM that is validated by a mix of human employees, machine learning and Artificial Intelligence. Even so, this centralized version of the OSM data becomes proprietary and monetized, quite far from the founding OpenStreetMap ethos.Hack causes major apps to show anti-Semitic nameNEW YORK (AP) - Technology users got a surprise Thursday morning when their social and lifestyle apps seemingly labeled\u2026www.apnews.comVandalism on OSM came into the spotlight this September when an anti-Semitic alteration to the city of \u201cNew York\u201d to \u201cJewtropolis\u201d was made. This was edited and erased within 24 hours by the OSM community, however a snapshot of the vandalized data made it through the Mapbox review process and was pushed to the applications that reply on the Mapbox map, including FOAM\u2019s base map: \u201ca Mapbox artificial-intelligence tool flagged the problem when it showed up and quarantined the abusive changes, a reviewer then mistakenly pushed through one of the edits anyway, overwriting correct data.\u201d Bloomberg writes: \u201cjust as Facebook and Twitter are struggling to keep foreign agents from using their services to manipulate public opinion, companies that make money from open-source products are facing their own struggle to protect their systems.\u201d\u201cThe OpenStreetMap Foundation, a not-for-profit group based in Cambridge, England, said in a blog post that the changes were reversed so quickly that no one noticed them until Mapbox served up the vandalized OpenStreetMap data to thousands of apps and websites.\u201dWhy You Can't Always Trust Your Handy Map AppFor centuries, people have relied on maps to figure out where they are and where they're going. But today's digital\u2026www.nytimes.com\u201cSam Hind, a researcher at the University of Siegen in Germany who studies navigation technology, said mapping developers have come to realize that their users collectively have better up-to-date local knowledge than their own teams can collect.\u201cOf course, this comes with a catch \u2014 that you can rely on the veracity of the knowledge, and that you can somehow verify this,\u201d he said.That\u2019s an issue for business listings on Google Maps.

One was titled, \u201cWhat 2016 would look like if just women voted,\u201d and showed a mostly blue electoral map, and the other was titled, \u201cWhat 2016 would look like if just men voted,\u201d which depicted a mostly red United States with a few blue outliers.The maps went viral, with a total of 17,000 retweets between the two tweets, and spawned hundreds of copies, some serious, some not.A new analysis of \u201cviral maps\u201d published in Cartography and Geographic Information Science examines the more than 500 maps that sprang from Silver\u2019s original one, using Google\u2019s Cloud Vision image analysis platform. The study also points out maps that were created with the pure purpose of misinforming. One egregious example, which claimed to represent an electoral map if only taxpayers voted, was simply a retitled map of something else entirely.In closing of this reading list is a piece by Bloomberg titled: \u201cThe World Economy Runs on GPS.

Above all, the desire to return to a simpler economy and society is the critical common theme across the two phenomena.As this pendulum of simplicity swings back to greater complexity with tokenisation and decentralised finance or #DeFI, the lack of real economy ( trade in goods and services) transactions on the public blockchains becomes a significant barrier to adoption. Crossing this barrier requires bridges to the off-chain fiat world, which add compliance, risk and operations costs that are similar to the banking system, reducing the promised economic benefit of decentralised cryptocurrency.Addressing this contradiction in turn requires a set of foundational, infrastructure components that we call web3, i.e. infrastructure for cryptocurrency networks that can support real economy transactions at internet scale.Burning Man EconomicsI haven\u2019t had the opportunity to attend the famous Burning Man Project festival yet but working in #Blockchain and #Cryptocurrency, I hear about it all the time. So I decided to research the event, and it\u2019s association with cryptocurrency.This is what Wikipedia has to say:A Brief Introduction to the Burning Man Festival\u201cBurning Man is an event held annually in the western United States at Black Rock City, a temporary city erected in the Black Rock Desert of northwest Nevada, approximately 100 miles (160 km) north-northeast of Reno. The late summer event is an experiment in community and art, influenced by ten main principles: radical inclusion, radical self-reliance, radical self-expression, communal effort, civic responsibility, gifting, decommodification, participation, immediacy, and leave no trace. The event takes its name from its culmination, the symbolic ritual burning of a large wooden effigy (\u201cThe Man\u201d) that traditionally occurs on the Saturday evening of the event.\u201dBurning Man and Crypto: Two Great Economic experimentsFor the purposes of our discussion, a much more interesting perspective on the festival is offered by the Business Insider. I quote:No money is exchanged at Burning Man, so participants are expected to bring food, supplies, shelter, and anything else they might need. If there we no crypto to fiat bridges eg exchanges, that\u2019 kinda how we\u2019d live.Unlike the world outside the gates of Burning Man, the annual weeklong festival operates as a gifting society. Not sure if there\u2019s a parallel in crypto yet. Maybe the reader can help.According to one of the The 10 Principles of Burning Man, the festival \u201cis devoted to acts of gift giving. The value of a gift is unconditional. Gifting does not contemplate a return or an exchange for something of equal value. Basically no debt, only tangible and intangible bearer assets as in #crypto.When gifting is the currency, rather than money or bartering, a strong sense of community evolves, one veteran burner explained to Festpop. \u201cThink about how you feel when you receive an unconditional gift. You feel an instant connection to that person, and a sense of gratitude.\u201d This is how one feels when they receive ICO tokens in an Airdrop or tokens in a pre sale at a discount ahead of the masses.Deep Ties to CryptoCoinDesk wrote about these ties in detail and TwoBitIdiot came up with profoundest ever quote on the topic\u2026 and the ties are serious because Burning Man attracts the staunchest crypto believers:\u201cFundstrat co-founder Tom Lee claims the #bitcoin price nosedived this week because the crypto-sphere is distracted by the Burning Man festival. Moreover, Lee predicts the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates 75 basis points by the spring of 2020\u201d.The Essence of Burning Man: SimplifyMarc Andreessen\u2019s Netscape generation that went to work in the 90s built the current web aka web2. We made lives too complicated with more transistors per chips, crazy bandwidth, smartphones, sustained economic growth, three car garages, financial engineering and big data. And we are still going at it while neo-millennials scream out for simplifying the endless complexity life and finance that I hinted at in my previous blog:The Messy Real World: Complexity Strikes Burning ManIt turns out, it\u2019s not just love that runs the Burning Man festival. Even the economic experiment of Burning Man can not be untied from the consumerist, monetary economy and all of its rather complex human characteristics. These include:Consumption: \u201cBut there are two luxuries that attendees can buy\u200a\u2014\u200aice and coffee.\u201d\u2026 there is no Dark Web involved though.Hedonistic Consumption: \u201cEvery year now, an avalanche of articles lament the copious amounts of money and narcotics flowing into the commodification of a supposedly non-capitalist festival\u201d. There may be some DARK Web involved here however.Fiat Money: There\u2019s always a bridge to the fiat world, like a crypto exchange\u00a0and\u00a0there\u2019s indeed\u00a0scarcity\u00a0to\u00a0justify\u00a0a\u00a0price. Besides, you are in America so there must be a car. \u201cMost tickets sell for $425, according to the event\u2019s official website, and you\u2019ll also have to purchase a $100 vehicle pass for each car you drive in. Approximately 4,000 pre-sale tickets are available starting in mid-March, at $1,400 each. Kids 12 and under can go to Burning Man for free.\u201dThe Corporations: Just like at the brilliant Consensus conference, the \u201cold economy\u201d sponsors keep piling up. \u201cIn 2014, North American companies reportedly spent $1.23 billion to sponsor music venues, festivals, and tours.\u201dDeath and Taxes: Just like in Crypto, the IRS finds us. According to federal tax filings, the Burning Man non-profit garnered $3.7 million (after expenses) in 2017, after acquiring Fly Ranch for $6.5 million in 2016.Externalities i.e. we do leave a trace: Well we did use a car or an RV to carry love to the desert in the same way we need mining hardware and electricity to mine bitcoin, so our trace was there from the beginning. \u201cThe CoolingMan organisation has estimated that the 2006 Burning Man was responsible for the generation of 27,000 tons of carbon dioxide, with 87% being from transportation to and from the remote location.[189] The Sierra Club has criticised Burning Man for the \u201chundreds of thousands\u201d of plastic water bottles that end up in landfills, as well as ostentatious displays of flames and explosions.\u201dInflation: What did we say about scarcity in Crypto? This is a wide open desert so we must create scarcity. \u201cMeanwhile, the regular admission price has increased over the years. CNBC estimated in 2016 that the total cost of attending could range from $1,300 up to $20,000\u201d.Inequality: Burning Man has attracted a number of billionaires and celebrities, many of them from Silicon Valley and Hollywood. These billionaires have paid for more luxurious camps to be set up in recent years which general consist of lavish RV\u2019s and luxury restroom trailers that are driven into the city and connected together to form de facto gated areas. These billionaires then fly in to the airport on private planes, are driven to their camps, served by hired help (nicknamed \u201csherpas\u201d), and sleep in air-conditioned beds.\u201dOh Well! Now we visit the other festival\u2026Bitcoin, the Burning Man of FinanceCrypto in the modern form started as a protest during Occupy Wall Street as a desire to simplify the world of finance with one word \u2014 \u201cbitcoin\u201d. In a way, Bitcoin is the burning man festival of blockchain and cryptocurrency technology. This desire to simplify to \u201cone simple word\u201d whether love or bitcoin, is indeed the subtle connection between the psychology of Burning Man and the psychology of Crypto.Modern crypto funds have hedge fund like names eg \u201cMorgan Creek Capital\u201d. Here\u2019s the aptly short-named founder of Morgan Creek Capital being quoted for \u201cShort the Bankers, Long Bitcoin\u201d cry, which apparently now is being extended to various other financial assets and market mechanisms\u2026And indeed, even in other #Crypto Platforms:So which Morgan will prevail? Fiat JP Morgan or Crypto Morgan Creek? I think it doesn\u2019t matter. Let\u2019s see why\u2026When Debt Gets in the Way of Love, Money ArisesBasically, even at BurningMan, even when we gift, we end up owing each other, unless we choose to delude ourselves. That\u2019s called being human and the act of \u201cowing\u201d is called Debt. These debts need to be settled but settling debts on a bilateral basis doesn\u2019t work because you owe me less than I owe you and Peter owes me more than Peter owes you.We solve this mess of debts with the magic idea called Money. By creating money, we can exchange goods and services on a bilateral basis in complex transactions and pay each other in units of debts owed to a clearing agent. All of this \u201cmoney\u201d system is supported by the artefacts of known identities, credit risk control and legal recourse using this thing called \u201cmoney\u201d that is expressed in units called \u201ccurrency\u201d.This act of clearing turns an O(n square) problem of settling debts into an O(n) problem and allows us to engage in incredibly complex economic transactions, manage risk, plan businesses, create complex social hierarchies, trade goods and services across economies and raise living standards for humanity. The clearing agents are called Banks and when Banks end up with the same O(n square) problem, we create central banks to clear debts between these banks.But there\u2019s no Domino\u2019s Pizza on a blockchain yet\u2026Wouldn\u2019t it be nice if crypto could just deal with the money part and skip the messy parts about trade, data, goods, law and services i.e. delegate the real economy to the fiat people who deal with messy things and the technology?The trouble with this #crypto dream is that almost no one ever buys a Pizza (or much else) with #Bitcoin or pretty much any other #cryptocurrency yet. Bitcoin is a terrific innovation but you can\u2019t do much with it. It\u2019s not a payment system because not many merchants accept it and not many buyers want to pay with it. All you can do is trade with it or HODL it.Thus, somewhat conveniently, #Bitcoin becomes \u201cdigital gold\u201d i.e. \u201ccensorship resistant store of value\u201d rather than the \u201cpayment system\u201d it was supposed to be when Satoshi designed it. If we want to do anything in the real economy, e.g. buy a Pizza, we have to go back to uncle Sam\u2019s money i.e. the US Dollar aka Fedcoin.Money, like love, gets complicated over time\u2026So what else do we do with crypto? Maybe we can lend it? Oh yes! Crypto folks, like fiat folks also want to borrow and lend and crypto is just a bearer asset, so we create various types of lending and borrowing mechanisms with #DeFI aka decentralised finance.With the explosion of lending apps, in 2019, crypto has started to evolve its own parallel wall street with 100s of ex wall street folks and financial engineers going at complex derivatives and synthetic on-chain products.Why? It\u2019s Debt. Again, Debt. The one word we can\u2019t get away from. Here\u2019s what that does:As soon as we start with lending crypto onchain, we realise that love is good but credit losses are not good but \u2192On permissionless networks, the borrower doesn\u2019t know the lender and conversely so \u2192The only way to manage the risk is Collateral but \u2192Crypto collateral is highly volatile so most defi lending apps require more collateral than the loan itself. Of course \u2192The only time one would post 150% collateral if they were speculating massively on a price increase.A quick recap. So far our one word answers to finance have been:2008\u2013Infinity: #bitcoin2012\u20132014: #Blockchain2015: #smartContracts2016: #Decentralisation2017 and 2018: Tokens, ICO and STO.2019: #defi and #OpenFinanceAs the savvy reader might notice, every year, the complexity reducing burning men and burning women have been adding their own layers of complexity on top of love and bitcoin.We haven\u2019t quite come full circle yet but maybe, just maybe \u2026 we can see the arc\u2026 except\u2026 we are tied to fiat.Tough Love: We can\u2019t have two tier financial regulation\u2026We work around this minor of issue of almost no real economy transactions (the medium of exchange and unit of account problems) by creating fiat bridges i.e. asset backed stablecoins, synthetic stablecoins and crypto exchanges (both centralised and decentralised) as workarounds and bridges to fiat.Complexity has started FWIW.Unfortunately, when we create fiat bridges to the real economy, we run into a fiat based monetary system and a fiat based regulatory system aka the much (un)loved AML, interstate commerce, securities law and systemic risk regimes, which aren\u2019t designed to deal with internet based money or a p2p, decentralised financial system. We don\u2019t like it because its not love or self expression, it\u2019s hard complicated work to make finance and economies work.So We Must Create a Real Economy to feed Crypto Finance\u2026As Marc Andreessen noted in his A3Z podcast, I paraphrase, \u201cAmazon had a book store\u2026 who\u2019s using THIS thing?\u201da16z Podcast: From the Internet\u2019s Past to the Future of CryptoWhat can we learn from the history of the internet for the future of crypto? In this episode of the a16z Podcast\u2026open.spotify.comWhere do we go now\u2026So what do we do to make this thing work? I think the narrative needs to change back to the internet of value, with the internet being the operative word this time and not value. Here are a few suggestions:Build usefulIn 2015 Balaji S. Srinivasan invoked the #BUIDL cry and in 2017, I fortunately echoed it. Unfortunately, fuelled by the ICO boom, 90% of what we as a community built has been pretty useless (10% is exceptional and foundational, which IMO is a great harvest even for tech). For the 90% in nonstarters and failed experimentation, it\u2019s my personal view that the amount of what I call \u201cnon-product\u201d (something that sounds cool but no one needs or wants) in #blockchain exceeds any other technology I have ever had the opportunity to touch since the dot com boom. That of course is par for the internet course.So I\u2019d say it\u2019s about time we update this rallying cry to #BUIDL-USFL ie build useful stuff, stop disrupting and start building. As John Wolpert said:Invest 10x in Web3 than we do in De(centralised)FI and Ce(ntralised)FIAs I argued earlier, the path to #defi goes though #web3 ie for a public chain based financial system to be sustainable, there must be corresponding levels of public chain based real economic activity aka internet commerce to support it. The internet had to become a vehicle for finance because it became a tremendous vehicle for people to engage in real economic activity. With Crypto, we have to swing it in reverse. We started with money, now we need to build something for someone to need this new money.Essentially, If #cryptocurrency needs to become money in the real world, then the blockchain has to play this role of enabling the real economy i.e. more than speculation and trading among coins. To make that possible, we need to make web3 work. Web3 is where the next generation internet products and services work because of the enhancements to the current architecture of the internet provided by secure shared ledgers, cryptography and decentralised applications.Unless the web3 infrastructure works, many of even the most robust and well thought out ideas in #DeFi and #OpenFinance will be restrained in their potential. Spending a ton of money on DeFi over Web3 is like putting a cart before the horse and the fintech fallacy is at the heart of it. This emphasis on Web3 is what Ethereum community at large is getting exactly right as we speak.My Definition of Web3This is part of the problem. Web3 is whatever folks want it to be, so while I wait for this definition to be standardised (by web3c or some other body of geniuses), I will provide my own list of foundational components in what I think the web3 stack here needs to be at a minimum:Web-scale shared ledgers (may or may not be a blockchain when we\u2019re done).Smart Contracts/Deterministic stored scriptsSettlement finality for transactionsPortable IdentityData PrivacyWallets with superior UX and key recoveryGovernance protocols for asset recoveryLegalTechDe-Emphasise #NumberGoUpNumberGoUp is a meme that stands for \u201cif my coin is going up, I must be doing something right and my theories about my coin and the world at large must be true\u201d.

Most bitcoin maximalist arguments can be translated as \u201cmy number go up and your number go down\u201d.The trouble with spending any energy on NumberGoUp is that not just hot capital like \u201ccrypto funds\u201d, even the sage-like long term investors of #SiliconValley get restless when the Number Don\u2019t go Up as the leading minds at USV did last week.

The market has rallied from its lows this past winter and is up\u2026avc.comArgue for Regulatory Reform, Not Special TreatmentIf people were buying pizzas for #crypto no financial regulator would have a problem as long as the pizza is safe, reasonably priced and good. If on the other hand, the point of #crypto is to buy fiat then sadly the fiat world #regulation has to apply because a two tier regulation is just an unsustainable minefield of regulatory arbitrage.Essentially we the #crypto community won\u2019t be getting much love for our cries for favorable treatment because if we do get any, the banks are going to justifiably cry. We have to make sound arguments for broader regulatory reform across the fiat and crypto financial systems.For example, special rules for ICOs are untenable whereas a technology independent conversation about private securities markets reform tends to be a very sensible conversation with the regulators, and it quickly leads to \u2026 \u201coh so here\u2019s how the public blockchain can help!\u201d.It\u2019s not the Regulators, It\u2019s the ConsumersThis point needs to be stated twice. As noted earlier:OECD regulators are under no pressure to reform any rules to support cryptocurrency because \u2192Consumers (aka voters) aren\u2019t creating any such pressure because \u2192Most Consumers aren\u2019t using any #cryptocurrency based services because \u2192er\u2026 there aren\u2019t many useful services out there because and even when there are \u2192The UX is awful More on that later.In the absence of consumer utility, much of the focus of crypto advocacy has been on the innovation argument \u2014 which essentially says, \u201cpolicymakers and regulators should make special rules for crypto because we are innovative and if you don\u2019t support us, you will lose the competitive advantage of nations\u201d. Some of the wiser folks even invoke the great Michael Porter and his book.Here\u2019s the catch though. Every time we argue that regulators must support #innovation, regulators tend to ask the Marc Andressen question \u201cok, we get the innovation, but who\u2019s using this innovation\u201d?Essentially #crypto needs a bit more than \u201cinnovation\u201d to justify its existence and its time to look for better arguments for broader policy measures and reg reform that support #cryptoCode is not Law. Invest in Legal Tech and turn Law into CodeLaw governs and enables all economic activity. As Raghuram Rajan argued, it\u2019s the \u201cRule of Law\u201d rather than natural resources or population that determine economic progress. If there is going to be a decentralised economy to provide a sound basis for a decentralised financial system, legal tech will provide the foundation for it. Without legal tech to provide a foundation of legal basis and legal recourse, #DeFi applications will largely be limited to speculation and experimentation and not complex real economy products and services and business models required for the #FutureOfWork.Fortunately, some teams like OpenLaw and Clause are doing critically important experiments and product engineering in this area:Emphasise UXAs much as Anthony Pompliano says \u201c short the bankers\u201d, the consumer experience of #crypto wallets remains much worse than the consumer experience of even big bank mobile apps, let alone Paypal and Venmo. Unless we go crazy about UX, decentralisation and revolution aren\u2019t gonna land customers and consumers.And we close this story with a Ch(r)antI have seen things across the ecosystem become much more focussed and grown up this year and I think the relative scarcity of capital, compared to the glut in 2017 and 2018 has a lot to do with it. In 2017 and 2018 everyone was doing cool things for cool\u2019s sake and the P word (Product) became disconnected with the C word (Customer). This year, the capital got a lot tighter across the crypto ecosystem and even people building speculative and gambling products started thinking about the C word \u2014 the Customer. To me, this is the revolution we have desperately needed.So we return to the \u201cimmutable\u201d laws of Physics and chant (rant) together:", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Defi", "Cryptocurrency", "Fintech", "Internet"]}, {"title": "Tech and Research Updates", "post_link": "https://medium.com/web3foundation/tech-and-research-updates-464048c4c280?source=search_post", "author_name": "Web3 Foundation Team", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@web3", "publish_date": "2019-08-26", "last_modified_date": "2019-08-29", "readtime": "2.74", "claps": 190, "voters": 10, "content": "Tech and Research UpdatesWeb3 Foundation TeamFollowAug 26 \u00b7 3 min readThe Web3 Foundation nurtures and stewards technologies and applications in the fields of decentralized web software protocols.

The contest for winning a new LADA Niva, considered a true \u2018people\u2019s car\u2019 in Russia (which we only half-jokingly dubbed \u2018our Tesla\u2019), was entirely run on the blockchain, which ensured full honesty and transparency.Sergei Tolmachev, head of Waves\u2019 R&D department, explained the algorithm for choosing the winner and ran it in real time, using the Pick Winners plugin to select the future owner of the LADA Niva.Meanwhile, another contest was run during the meetup. Participants had to implement tasks suggested by a Telegram bot, such as taking selfies with other meetup participants, and the first 10 people who completed all the tasks correctly collected their prizes.The first prize was a ticket to the Web 3.0 Summit in Berlin this August. Those who took second, third and fourth places collected 150, 100 and 50 WAVES, respectively, while prizes for places 5 through 10 were Waves-branded Ledger Nano S cold storage wallets.Switching back to business, Artem Tolkachev, general director of Tokenomica \u2014 a fully compliant, Malta-registered crypto exchange \u2014 provided updates on the BetterTokens association that is developing crypto standards and, of course, on Tokenomica itself.Tokenomica, as a major platform for the issuance and trading of security tokens in a regulated environment, offers a technical and legal framework for digital assets. The main news was the launch of Tokenomica\u2019s DEX, as a major step towards decentralisation of trading in the future.Meanwhile, among Tokenomica\u2019s further plans are the launch of an extended version, tentatively scheduled for TestNet in May and on MainNet in July.The meetup\u2019s main highlight was a talk by Sasha Ivanov, Waves\u2019 founder and general director, in which he shared his insights on the future of Web 3.0.\u2018We are no longer working on blockchain, we are working on Web 3.0,\u2019 he said. \u2018In Russia, we are the sole company that focuses on Web 3.0 products.\u2019Explaining his vision of the Web 3.0 future, Sasha said: \u2018The arrival of a larger number of social connections for people and availability of information have not led to transparency and unity of the world. On the contrary, we are witnessing considerable division.\u2018But there is a cure for every sickness,\u2019 he went on to say. \u2018And so blockchain has arrived, a technology opening doors for a number of other technologies, which should counter the centralisation trend and facilitate building of transparent, more efficient systems. We\u2019re developing applications that bridge the ideology of blockchain, Web 3.0 and decentralisation with reality. We are creating systems that will work and make money right now.\u2019The presentations were followed by a Q&A session with Sasha Ivanov, networking and fun activities.In addition to the contests mentioned above, the attendees were able to take part in a contest on their Web 3.0 knowledge. The winners were awarded with WAVES tokens which, in turn, could be exchanged for Waves-branded souvenirs at the makeshift gift shop.Overall, this year\u2019s Waves birthday celebration attracted many more guests than last year\u2019s event, with over 700 people showing up: a testament to the significant interest in both Waves and Web 3.0.Join Waves CommunityRead Waves News channelFollow Waves TwitterSubscribe to Waves Subreddit", "responses": 1, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Web3", "Wavesplatform"]}, {"title": "A Venture Capital Perspective on Web3", "post_link": "https://medium.com/believing/a-venture-capital-perspective-on-web3-195125780ca8?source=search_post", "author_name": "Real Ventures", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@realventures", "publish_date": "2019-06-13", "last_modified_date": "2019-06-13", "readtime": "12.6", "claps": 7, "voters": 6, "content": "A Venture Capital Perspective on Web3Crypto\u2019s promise of a decentralized future and what investors are excited aboutReal VenturesFollowJun 13 \u00b7 13 min readPhoto by Dmitry Sytnik on UnsplashIt\u2019s been a long cold lonely crypto winter, but here comes the sun: blockchain and Web3 represent an exciting future for the Internet and society\u2019s relationship with technology. Our Partner Mark McDowell speaks with Director of Communications, Lauren Jane Heller, about where he sees the greatest impacts of crypto, why not everything belongs on Web3 and what hurdles lie in the way of massive crypto adoption.So what are you and the other people who are deep in the blockchain and crypto community really getting excited about right now?Big picture, the most exciting thing is the emergence of Web3. That\u2019s what we crazies call the new Internet. It\u2019s an Internet of decentralized apps that\u2019s built on top of blockchains. It\u2019s pretty exciting: we have a new Internet that is respectful of our privacy and anonymity. And it\u2019s not going to be based on advertising.I think we\u2019re also beginning to understand that not every online experience belongs on Web3. For example, I don\u2019t think e-commerce particularly belongs on Web3. Amazon works amazingly well and no one is clamouring for a decentralized version. I also don\u2019t believe that e-commerce has an unhealthy reliance on advertising. Of course Amazon operates one of the largest ad networks in the world, but their ad business drives e-commerce, not simply \u201cattention commerce.\u201dIf we have Web3 emerging and we have certain aspects of the current Internet that would not make sense to have on Web3, how would we interact with it? Would it be on the same devices we currently use? How would this actually work?I find this exciting because all of this still needs to be figured out. If you go to a Web3 website, you can\u2019t do anything if you don\u2019t have a crypto wallet like MetaMask, which is a Chrome extension. If you have MetaMask, then you can make some tiny payments to power your dapps. Decentralized apps need a little bit of cryptocurrency in order to run \u2014 cryptocurrency is like the gasoline. So, instead of advertising, you\u2019re paying a little tiny sliver of cryptocurrency to do what you want to do.I think the next couple years is going to be spent figuring out which Internet services belong in Web3 and which ones don\u2019t. Ideally, the user experience of Web3 won\u2019t be noticeably different than the user experience of Web 2.0. I think that we\u2019ll continue to experience the Internet through computers and mobile phones. You\u2019ll still go to web pages and you\u2019ll still run apps. Almost everything we do on a computer or an app runs in the Cloud. What we see in our device is really just what gets displayed for us. The difference with Web3 is that back-end processing is going to be decentralized on computer nodes all over the world, whereas in Web 2.0 cases it will be centralized.There\u2019s just so much pent up desire for a new Internet that respects users\u2019 privacy and has a native currency.What kind of apps are most likely to be on Web 3?It\u2019s hard to know because right now people are so excited about Web3 that they want to do everything on Web3. They want decentralized versions of Google, Facebook, Amazon, Uber, Spotify and Tinder. Over the next few years, we\u2019ve got to figure out which ones really need to be decentralized.Web3 is good for low trust situations. If you\u2019re buying something in cash you don\u2019t have to trust the other person. Cash is cash. We need something like that on the Internet. We need decentralized money. I think decentralized finance \u2014 DeFi \u2014 is going to be a huge category for Web3. We\u2019ll see currency and financial products \u2014 derivatives, options, banks, interest-earning platforms and lending platforms all based on cryptocurrency.We\u2019ll see a lot of gaming on Web3, especially gambling and other games where you don\u2019t want to trust the house. We\u2019re also starting to see prediction markets on Web3. These are dapps where users can wager on anything: political outcomes, sporting events, the weather, whatever they want. Users create wagers and the odds are computed continuously as users place their bets. The blockchains pay out all the wagered funds to the winning side.These prediction markets could be really powerful. It\u2019s more than just wagering \u2014 it\u2019s a way to predict the future. If you\u2019ve got millions of people wagering on certain events, then you\u2019re harnessing the wisdom of crowds.So for a prediction market or for some of these dapps, what would the business model for the companies be? How would they be monetized? Are all of the users going to be doing micropayments like you suggested for YouTube (see Blockchain 101 below), or are there a bunch of different business models that are being envisioned right now for these decentralized apps?What if I told you there is no company?Well if there\u2019s no company, what\u2019s the incentive for people to build it? And then how is it maintained? I understand that it\u2019s going to be decentralized, but how does that really work?One of the big ideas of Web3 is a new type of entity called a DAO \u2014 a Decentralized Autonomous Organization. Instead of a company, there is software code on the blockchain that defines everything the entity is allowed to do. Let\u2019s say we wanted a global prediction market. It needs to be administered by some entity. Well, that could be a DAO that implements all the rules to run the prediction market. As users, we would send some of our cryptocurrency into the DAO \u2014 into the code \u2014 and lock it up. The DAO will have some rules: maybe the DAO get to keep 0.1 percent of the money that\u2019s wagered, and then distribute it back to the original supporters until they get their money back. But there is no corporation \u2014 we don\u2019t need to trust anybody. In fact Nick Tomaino who runs 1confirmation, a crypto-focused venture fund that we back, wrote an interesting blog post called The Slow Death of the Firm and it\u2019s all about how corporations may go away and just be replaced by DAOs.So the person who is initially writing that code to create the DAO is doing this in an altruistic fashion just because they believe in the project?Well, sort of. The world of Web3 has a great culture right now because it is highly mission driven. We have extremely talented developers who are excited to be on the brink of a new Internet and who are volunteering their time to develop these DAOs. They\u2019re developing these projects out of love for the technology, and out of a belief that there\u2019s a better Internet. Personally, I find that awesome. It\u2019s a little bit like the open source movement. And there might very well be a way for these people to be paid. The code that implements the DAO might have a provision for a small payment to the developers and supporters.The world of Web3 has a great culture right now because it\u2019s highly mission driven. We have extremely talented developers who are excited to be on the brink of a new Internet and who are volunteering their time to develop these DAOs.Roughly how many people currently are doing this kind of work and volunteering their time and writing code and creating these decentralized apps?It\u2019s really hard to answer because of the nature of decentralization. It\u2019s really kind of anonymous \u2014 by definition not organized. But I\u2019ve heard estimates that Ethereum has a developer community of about 250,000. I would say that\u2019s probably a good number for the global community of contributors.We\u2019ve been talking mostly about what\u2019s really exciting, but what do you think are the things that are going to get in the way of Web3 in decentralizing the Internet?Number one on the list and probably number one, two and three is regulation. It\u2019s not clear in the US whether it falls under the SEC, The Securities and Exchanges Commission, or under the CFTC which is the Commodities Futures Trading Commission. Are cryptocurrencies commodities or are they securities? Bitcoin and Ethereum have been labelled commodities but it\u2019s ambiguous for the other two thousand cryptocurrencies. And even if we did know whether they were securities or commodities, neither organization \u2014 The CFTC nor the SEC \u2014 has written any rules about crypto.The SEC relies on the Securities Act of 1933, which was passed in the aftermath of the Great Depression almost 100 years ago. So far, the SEC has said that\u2019s all the rules we need. Um, are you serious? You don\u2019t think cryptocurrency on the Internet might be worthy of a fresh look? Are utility token that fuel online computing the same as stock certificates? What are the tax implications of converting Bitcoin into a stablecoin during periods of volatility? How do we treat and tax assets that magically appear through hard forks or airdrops? The list of questions goes on. The SEC won\u2019t put out new rules to clarify matters, but they have become increasingly aggressive about suing companies which they believe are in violation of the 1933 Act. They just announced a lawsuit against Kik last week. Unfortunately, the SEC is regulating through enforcement rather than through new rules, and as a result they\u2019re paralyzing innovation in the US in this crucial new frontier of the Internet.So most likely Web3 is probably not going to be happening in the next six months or even a year? Or maybe two? Or maybe five?Web3 is already beginning to emerge. There are conferences all around the world where developers meet to discuss their projects. When we finally get regulatory clarity, I believe there will be a Cambrian explosion of Web3 companies. There\u2019s just so much pent up desire for a new Internet that respects users\u2019 privacy and has a native currency.\ud83d\udc47Read on below for a primer in blockchain and crypto.

Sign up for our newsletter and follow us on Twitter, LinkedIn and Facebook.Blockchain 101Source: Shift MarketsFor those who aren\u2019t super familiar with the space, I\u2019d like to get back to the basics. Why are Bitcoin, crypto and the blockchain so exciting? And why do you believe this is something that is going to change the world as we know it?Fundamentally, the blockchain is a new paradigm for computing. It\u2019s a whole new way of looking at how applications work and the business models behind them. What makes it different is that blockchain-based projects are not necessarily controlled by a company or a government. They\u2019re fully decentralized.Why is that important? Well, I think we\u2019re all a little sceptical about where the Internet has gotten us today. There are a few companies \u2014 Google, Facebook, Amazon \u2014 controlling massive amounts of information about people. They\u2019re highly centralized. They know a lot about us and they use the data to drive advertising. I find it a little bit depressing that the ultimate business model for the Internet is advertising \u2014 I had higher hopes.A small digression: I read this science fiction book when I was in high school called The Red Dwarf: Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers by Doug Naylor and Rob Grant. It\u2019s a story about the crew of a spaceship that had left Earth a thousand years earlier with a top secret mission. The crew had been in space for so long that they had reproduced over dozens of generations so their offspring could carry the mission forward. The book opens when the spaceship is finally about to execute its mission \u2014 to launch a nuclear missile into the heart of a star. When they launch the missile, the star erupts in a gigantic explosion and the crew promptly turns their ship around to begin their long journey back to earth. But of course, the crew are like \u201cHey, why did we have that mission in the first place? What was the whole point of all those years on a spaceship?\u201d They had no idea. But on Earth that night, at that exact moment, if someone looked up into the night sky, they would have seen hundreds of other stars exploding. And they spelled out a message. They spelled out \u201cCOKE ADDS LIFE\u201d.It\u2019s funny but I see this as a parable for the Internet. We have this incredible technology that changed the whole world. And all we\u2019ve gotten from it is a bunch of ads that we don\u2019t want. \u201cCOKE ADDS LIFE.\u201d So what I like about blockchain is that it is decentralized and not dependent on ad revenue. Our data won\u2019t be warehoused inside large organizations that are going to weaponize it against us.Once you\u2019ve taken that off the table, then you open up other business models, such as micro payments and utility tokens. What if YouTube had no advertising? What if you just paid one-hundredth of a cent for every video you watched? In the course of a year it might cost you ten bucks. But all those content producers would collect money. If somebody had a hundred million views, they\u2019d be making a lot of money. You wouldn\u2019t need advertising.So, fundamentally, blockchain represents a new architecture for computing. It holds the promise of new business models and new apps that are not controlled by companies or governments. If you believe this, then you probably want to invest in some of those new applications. But you also want to invest in the underlying infrastructure as well \u2014 all the pipes and plumbing. See, it\u2019s not about Bitcoin per se. Bitcoin being the first decentralized app \u2014 a digital token that could be exchanged or saved \u2014 introduced the much bigger idea of how the blockchain can serve us.So what are the other ways the blockchain can be used that are so paradigm-shifting?There are three emerging uses of the blockchain.First is store of value. Bitcoin could replace gold as a globally-accepted place to store value. I find it kind of anachronistic to buy gold \u2014 it\u2019s impractical to handle, transfer, redeem, or move across boundaries. Bitcoin is purely digital, can be moved around the globe in minutes at very low cost, and is increasingly known and respected as an alternate store of value. And Bitcoin is not the only store of value. We are seeing projects where real estate, artwork and other collectibles are \u201ctokenized\u201d so that investors can purchase arbitrarily small fractional stakes in these assets. It might be possible, for example, to invest $100 in real estate on a particular city block in Toronto. We are also seeing unique digital assets \u2014 think cryptokitties \u2014 that reside on the blockchain. These are called non-fungible tokens because unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, each token is unique and not interchangebable. Sound weird? It\u2019s really no different from collecting baseball cards or comic books.A second use case is to have a new unit of exchange, a new form of money that people can spend. People don\u2019t want to spend Bitcoin because it\u2019s so volatile, but there are stablecoins that are emerging. I\u2019m happy to spend a stablecoin because if its is worth a dollar today it\u2019s gonna be worth a dollar tomorrow and a dollar next year. And stablecoins are a form of cryptocurrency \u2014 they\u2019re not any more stable than, say, the US dollar, but they might be as stable as the US dollar and that\u2019s certainly good enough for a unit of exchange. All of a sudden you\u2019ve got a global currency that\u2019s not controlled by a government, not controlled by a company and it works on the Internet as a native digital currency.The third use case for the blockchain is that it can be an operating system for apps. We call them dapps with a \u201cd\u201d because they\u2019re decentralized apps. These are applications that don\u2019t run on centralized servers: they run on independent nodes all over the world.Are there are a lot of businesses that exist today that could easily become decentralized or do you think it\u2019s really a massive paradigm change for people or companies to think differently?I think we\u2019re facing a massive paradigm change. I believe a whole new generation of projects and companies are going to emerge with a vast array of dapps that are unique and wonderful because, by design, they will safeguard our privacy and cannot be tampered with.I also believe that existing enterprises will adapt and use blockchain because they value its reliability and immutability. Major corporations like Walmart and Target are exploring the use of blockchain for supply chain management and invoicing. In the supply chain, for example, many suppliers can contribute by logging information into a distributed ledger that becomes a permanent, auditable record.We will undoubtedly see companies introducing crytpocurrencies directly to consumers as well. Facebook revealed last week that it\u2019s going to have its own cryptocurrency to allow users around the world to buy and sell things from other users.Many people are wary of are the energy cost of mining Bitcoin and other tokens, and the fact that you can\u2019t do as many transactions as you can with say Visa or MasterCard. What are people doing right now to solve those problems?Today, Bitcoin and Ethereum both rely on mining in order to validate transactions. And mining does involve a lot of wasted computing resources because these miners compete to solve \u201cmake work\u201d math puzzles. That\u2019s called proof of work because each miner must perform computations and consume power in order to ensure the integrity of the network. This level of effort is what underwrites the security. The trouble is that this underwriting leads to a lot of wasted energy.Ethereum is moving away from proof of work to a new approach called proof of stake. Bitcoin will never move to proof of stake because it has very limited governance (by design) and even simple protocol changes are painstakingly slow. Bitcoin is going to continue to be an energy hog, but many people will argue that\u2019s what gives it its value. And by the way, Bitcoin has never been hacked. Ever. The security comes from the fact that you have all these competing miners doing hard work, and that\u2019s what\u2019s made it secure.Ethereum and most of the other new blockchains, however, are moving to proof of stake, whereby parties that already hold some of the cryptocurrency lock up a portion of their holdings and vouch for the validity of new transactions. If they falsely validate a new transaction, they lose what they\u2019ve staked. It\u2019s kind of like a performance bond. When the city of Montreal hires a contracting firm to build a new road, the firm must post a performance bond and if they don\u2019t deliver on time they lose their money. Proof of stake does not involve puzzle solving competitions, and that makes it vastly more energy efficient.Another nice thing about proof of stake is that people who lock up their cryptocurrency and act as stakers actually earn interest. There\u2019s no way to earn interest directly in Bitcoin. Proof of stake seems like a more enlightened way to reach consensus on the blockchain.But there\u2019s still another problem which is the speed of blockchain. Bitcoin can process something like four to seven transactions per second, and Ethereum about 15 transactions per second. But that\u2019s nothing compared to the Visa network. The Visa network, I think, can handle 1,700 transactions per second. Bitcoin and Ethereum have nowhere near that level of scalability, but there\u2019s a lot of work being done on Ethereum (and elsewhere) to address this.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Cryptocurrency", "Web3", "Venture Capital", "Bitcoin"]}, {"title": "Design Thinking for Blockchains, Web3 Summit 2018", "post_link": "https://medium.com/patara/design-thinking-for-blockchains-web3-summit-2018-fc61be5570f3?source=search_post", "author_name": "Engin Erdogan", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@erdogan", "publish_date": "2018-10-30", "last_modified_date": "2018-10-30", "readtime": "3.23", "claps": 104, "voters": 6, "content": "Design Thinking for Blockchains, Web3 Summit 2018Engin ErdoganFollowOct 30, 2018 \u00b7 4 min readLast week in Berlin, we participated at the Web3 Summit with our Design Thinking for Blockchain Workshop (Node 01). With this node, we introduced design thinking into Web3 stack as a collective and creative process for protocol design. This blog post is a quick summary of our experience and the group work that took place in our workshop.Overall, the workshop at Web3 was a rewarding experience. Coinciding with a great program of talks as well as being in the same open space with 10 other nodes was a proper challenge for a focused workshop. Even then, we had a nice turnout and a productive session.ParticipantsConsidering blockchains will have a significant impact on all walks of life, we believe protocol design should be an inclusive activity for all disciplines and experience levels to prevent creator biases being baked into platforms.In the same spirit at Web3 Summit, we were happy to host a diverse set of backgrounds including engineering, design, business development, law, community management, and investment. They all had one thing in common: they were dreamers of an exciting future unfolding in front of us and they all wanted to take part in shaping it.TopicParticipants of the Web3 Summit workshop worked on a protocol idea for a decentralized education system. They modeled a distributed ledger to keep verifiable records of continuous support interactions that extend beyond an organized event between instructors/teachers and trainees/students, that anyone can read/write, and owned or controlled by no single authority.As Vivien Leung (one of our participants) pointed out after her experience, this workshop is a systems design exercise that starts with people, not just an introductory session to blockchains.We started with mapping ecosystems and journeys, identified pain points of centralization and opportunities to disintermediate. Participants learned and utilized hands-on design thinking methods including stakeholder analysis, network modeling, journey mapping, and structured brainstorming. In the end, participants discussed the group work, expected outcomes and implications.FlowWe facilitated the workshop through following the steps in our Decentralization Method Sheet:1-Model the ecosystemParticipants started with mapping the network of actors and interactions in a training/workshop ecosystem. Then, they identified three actors that trust each other for a training/learning session, a trust loop: Instructor, Student, and Organizer.2-Identify journeysWith the trust loop identified, participants walked in the shoes of these stakeholders and articulated their needs, priorities, and challenges to discover moments of trust \u2014 how trust is implicit in the interactions and what could go wrong with the intermediary mechanisms that broker Instructor-Student interactions.3-Frame opportunitiesOnce the journeys are laid out, participants explored the trust loopholes (mistakes & misuses) and reframed them as opportunities. The goal was to brainstorm ways to disintermediate centralized mechanisms that are exercised by the Organizer stakeholder. We ended up with many ideas for disintermediation. Some of these were nascent and needed more thinking. Some of them immediately started to take shape with discussions among the group.4-Design the protocolParticipants picked one of the opportunities based on impact factors and started speculating on a fictional protocol as a means to disintermediate. They outlined a decentralized mechanism for capturing a support moment. They discussed concepts such as atomicity, verifiability, transparency, and privacy. Most importantly, there were particularly heated conversations around incentives, which makes the people-first approach particularly relevant in this system design exercise.5-Brainstorm Applications & ImplicationsFinally, we discussed as a group potential implications of this fictional protocol and imagined what type of applications may emerge upon it. Lots of exciting ideas came about such as extended learning networks and new breed co-working spaces. Important questions also came up such as the value of certification, verification of learning, and intellectual property.Thanks to Felipe Duarte\u2019s illustrative style, our worksheets turned out nicely legible and colorfulReceptionWe received helpful and constructive feedback from our participants both for the flow of the workshop and how we frame it.Is this a collaborative session for protocol design? Or is it a way to think about organizational transformation and decentralization is a means to that purpose?Marko Prljic (one of our participants) pointed out that they were expecting a reductive problem-solving workflow and instead, experienced a diverge-converge rhythm that pushed them to question whether they are addressing the right problem as they are thinking about a particular solution.We are grateful for the great participation and feedback.

But they inevitably will be, and many have already realised this.Bridges are being built to compensate for the lack of decentralised completeness. Ethereum\u2019s popular Python and Javascript Web3.0 wrappers, or Stellar\u2019s HTTP services are good examples of how Blockchain organisations are bridging the two worlds, allowing centralised platforms to communicate with their upcoming replacements.In a market where these Web2.5 applications are commonplace, it can become confusing to fully realise what a Web3.0 application fully consists of.Let\u2019s look at one characteristic of a Web3.0 DApp, and arguably amongst the most important:The Blockchain is the platform.This may not appear obvious in the market of today where the majority of applications with a Blockchain layer amongst their stack are built on a centralised platform.Furthermore, it is questionable whether the teams behind many of these applications have thought of the process they will have to undertake to remove this centralised component of their product \u2014 the platform.To clarify this problem, let\u2019s look at Facebook, a well known Web2.0 centralised platform.If Facebook introduced decentralised elements to their platform, this would characterise it as a Web2.5 platform. They could do this in a few ways:Introduce a decentralised data storage protocol such as IPFS to store non-sensitive public dataIntroduce a mutable decentralised database service that supports encrypted data, where immutability is not an issue (my bio, for example, does not require versioning or immutability \u2014 it is trivial)Introduce a digital token whereby users are rewarded for posting content, based on the content popularity, engagement metrics, and so on. (although this appears very unlikely to happen)Integrate a digital identity service to verify who you are, based on a Blockchain application, as is the case in Zug, Switzerland.All these Web3.0 elements have one thing in common \u2014 they work on a centralised platform. Hence merging them with a Web2.0 app forms a Web2.5 app.However, there is one element that will not work on Web2.0:Introduce DAOs to automate decision making on the platform, shaping how it evolves.This is the key element that you cannot integrate into a centralised platform, and what ultimately will define a Web3.0 application from a Web2.5 application.Why?Because concretely, the community is shaping the application, and no one owns it. For this scenario to be possible, the following need to happen:No one owns the source code. The entire application source code must be open sourced and fully transparent.No single points of failure. Centralised applications can be thought of as one-node applications, which equate to single points of failure. A decentralised application can potentially have thousands or millions of nodes distributed throughout the network, making it extremely hard to break.Adoption of DAOs, or complex smart contracts to control the rules of the application, with the ability to vote and transition to other DAOs if the need arises \u2014 e.g. major upgrade or fork to the application.Consensus. DAOs will have the ability to provide consensus mechanisms whereby the users of the application can vote to shape how the app evolves.These ideas are high level, but it is very obvious that they are severely against the interests of Facebook\u2019s current business model.The stark contrast between a closed, secretive competitive organisation and an open, decentralised collaborative organisation is extremely apparent, with somewhat opposite interests at heart.In order to create a Web3.0 application, you not only adopt a different tech stack in the product, you also adopt a new culture, vision and business model.Web2.5 is one phase in this evolution.If you are investing in an ICO or any decentralised application business, check whether the team have the capabilities to take the product from a partly decentralised product to a fully decentralised product.The differences between Web2.5 and Web3.0 as outlined above are huge, and the day will soon come where the leap to 3.0 will have to be made for applications to stay relevant. How many will successfully make the leap?

As part of the collaboration, researchers at the ICE center will conduct formal verification of the liveness and safety guarantees provided by the finality gadget used on the Polkadot platform.W3F Researcher Dr. Alistair Stewart devised a finality gadget, called GRANDPA (GHOST-based Recursive Ancestor Deriving Prefix Agreement), that allows for the separation of block production and the finality of those blocks. The goals are for the block production layer to be fast and probabilistically safe, while the finality gadget should be asynchronously safe, provide accountable safety, and be able to finalize many blocks at once.GRANDPA figures out which blocks more than 2/3 of nodes have in their chain, and finalizes them. It can also give different nodes different weights. These weights could be determined by amount staked in the protocol. In this diagram, blocks C, B, and A are finalized.The first project the collaboration will tackle is formalising the GRANDPA consensus algorithm. Ensuring consensus algorithms operate correctly is notoriously difficult, and we see formalization as a crucial step towards that outcome. After formalising the core steps of the algorithm, the teams will formally define, and prove, the safety of the algorithm. The ICE center will be undertaking the necessary work to formalise and verify the algorithm.Petar Tsankov from the ICE center said, \u201cI am really looking forward to the results that will come out of the collaboration between the Web 3 Foundation and the ICE center at ETH Zurich.

We are just beginning to understand the implications and anyone who has paid attention to global politics recently knows that there are many.Societies with an abundance of physical resources have a growing physical obesity problem.Societies with an abundance of digital resources have growing information obesity problem.The Short Story of High Fructose Corn SyrupAs I was thinking through some of these ideas, I started to wonder about how we got here.I started with high fructose corn syrup.It turns out that High Fructose Corn Syrup was commercialized in the early 1970s as a response to growing geo-political change.Oversimplifying it a lot, political upheaval in sugar-producing nations created a supply crunch in the US, driving the need for a technology-driven alternative to provide Americans with something sweet that wasn\u2019t expensive.What started off as a solution to one problem ended up becoming the cause of another, even bigger, problem.Today, with the Internet effectively controlled by a few massive corporations that do not have the best welfare of every individual as a core value, billions of people are in the process of abdicating their rights to personal choice and freedoms.I could go on for pages about the power of Alexa and Google to manipulate you through the answers it gives to your questions, Facebook to affect what you think and buy given the newsfeed, and Apple by preventing certain apps from running on their phones.Combine all of this with Big Data/AI, etc. and it\u2019s not difficult to imagine how are lives will be controlled by algorithms of which we are not even aware.An Alternative Digital LifestyleAny trend has many causes, but over the past few years, we have seen an explosion in the number of people doing yoga and meditation and choosing a vegetarian/vegan diet, just to name a few.Given the recent IPO of Beyond Meat (even if it did get a bit irrational), it\u2019s clear that investors think this trend is here to stay.I suspect that this is how many people choose to react to their own growing awareness to the unhealthy elements of the \u201cmainstream\u201d lifestyle, which has led to so many health problems, both physical and mental.I suspect that this is where Web3.0 has a chance to really shine.One of the more interesting marketing moves I have seen recently is from Blockstack, which put up an ad outside of Google\u2019s headquarters. It was a \u201cpoke the beast\u201d type of move that I am not 100% sure is worth the money now, but I could be wrong (after all, I\u2019m blogging about it now, so the ROI is clearly huge, right?But what I think IS brilliant about the billboard is that it builds on the theme of \u201cWeb3.0 as a lifestyle brand.\u201dAs in, you either want to be part of a movement that says \u201cdon\u2019t be evil,\u201d but is constantly pulled in the direction of evil in the name of revenue.Or you want to be part of a movement that literally cannot be evil.And if you choose the \u201cI want to be part of a group of people that literally cannot be evil,\u201d then you are making a lifestyle choice.You are choosing to take control of your personal, digital destiny.You are choosing to ensure and protect the digital freedoms of others from unknown, unseen, monopolistic powers that don\u2019t care about you\u2026they care about your wallet.Would you trust Coca-Cola to make dinner for your family?Self-Discipline and Self-Control is a ChoiceI have been reading a lot of stoic philosophy recently in preparation for a trip to Greece later this summer to study the roots of Democracy.The most well-known of all of the philosophers is probably Marcus Aurelius, the last of the \u201cgood emperors\u201d and the author of \u201cMeditations.\u201dMarcus Aurelius said,\u201cIf you are distressed by anything external, the pain is not due to the thing itself, but to your estimate of it; and this you have the power to revoke at any moment.\u201dGiven all that we have seen over the past few years (e.g. Cambridge Analytica, etc.), I suspect there is a growing awareness and frustration with the high-sugar diet of Web2.0 that is creating digital addiction and digital diabetes.What most people don\u2019t yet realize is that there\u2019s a healthier alternative.Thirty years ago, there were no vegan products on the shelves in supermarkets. No one was doing yoga in Times Square.Today they do.Those people have made a lifestyle choice for their bodies.Web3.0/blockchain/crypto is the lifestyle choice for their minds.A life full of digital intention.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Marketing", "Decentralized", "Cryptomarket"]}, {"title": "QuarkChain CEO Dr. Qi Zhou Gave Excellent Speeches on Web3 Summit", "post_link": "https://medium.com/quarkchain-official/quarkchain-ceo-dr-qi-zhou-gave-excellent-speeches-on-web3-summit-5ec68686e788?source=search_post", "author_name": "QuarkChain", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@quarkchainio", "publish_date": "2019-08-27", "last_modified_date": "2019-08-30", "readtime": "3.06", "claps": 45, "voters": 2, "content": "QuarkChain CEO Dr. Qi Zhou Gave Excellent Speeches on Web3 SummitQuarkChainFollowAug 27 \u00b7 4 min readWeb3 Summit 2019 was held in Berlin August 19\u201321, 2019 attracting thousands of web developers from all over the world to Funkhaus.QuarkChain CEO, Dr. Qi Zhou, also attended the summit together with his team. Dr. Qi Zhou gave two speeches about Boson and PoSW consensus. He also attended the open discussion about future of blockchain and Oracle and expressed his views on these topics.Web3 summit gathered developers and researchers for low-level protocols in blockchain and those interested in the latest developments in the decentralized web with a focus on the Web3 technology stack. Topics include: P2P protocols, platform neutral computation language, data distribution protocols. blockchains, t data/messaging, encrypted storage, protocol-extensible developer APIs and so on.On the Oracle HackerNode parallel session held on August 20\uff0c Dr. Qi Zhou gave a speech titling \u201cBoson Consensus\uff1aA Scalable Blockchain Sharding Consensus.\u201dDuring his speech, Dr. Qi Zhou introduced that the Boson consensus, pioneered by QuarkChain, is a class of consensus algorithms based on hash power distribution. Hash power adjustment mechanism enables the hash power to be distributed among the shards flexibly. Technique to reuse hashpower is developed to protect the newly added shards where the hash power is limited. This technique, when used, can enhance the security of the entire network. Relying on Boson consensus, one can implement a systematic structure of root chain-shards whereby the root chain confirms all blocks from sharded blockchains. Boson consensus is responsible for distributing the hash power between the root chain and the shards.According to Dr. Qi Zhou, thanks to Boson consensus ,QuarkChain mainnet has accomplished various functions, including multi-native-tokens, various consensus algorithms, and different mining algorithms. More importantly, QuarkChain was ahead of other public chains to adopt state sharding technology in its system design, a technology that is commonly viewed as the most challenging technique among all sharding technologies. State sharding technology and innovative cluster design enable more storage space and save additional computing resources in each node on shards, thus achieving high-efficiency for the entire network.On August 21, Dr. Qi Zhou gave another speech about PoSW consensus. During his speech, Dr. Qi Zhou said that PoSW consensus, the acronym for \u201cProof of Staked Work\u201d, is exclusively developed by QuarkChain and runs on the different shards. PoSW allows miners to enjoy the benefits of lower mining difficulty by staking original tokens.According to Dr. Qi Zhou, by using PoSW, QuarkChain combines the advantage of PoS and PoW. Under the PoSW mechanism, the miners and holders have a cooperative partnership, just like that between startups and venture capitalists. The miners themselves can create value. Moreover, thanks to the help from holders, they can improve the mining efficiency and become more competitive in winning the competition of hash power. The mechanism is more decentralized and has a higher security level which makes it resistant to both 51% attacks and infinite forking attacks. Through creating a cooperative model that mirrors the societal mechanism in real life, it is more humanly and thus more suitable for users.In addition, Dr. Qi Zhou participated in an open discussion about the prospects of Blockchain and Oracle. He talked freely about how to use PoSW and smart contracts to incentivize token holders and miners to join the blockchain platform more actively. As for the newest development of eWASM, in his opinion, Dr. Qi Zhou thought that eWASM improved the VM\u2019s efficiency but one would need more time to master the technology. On the other hand, the best practice of Solidity on eWASM requires more time to mature. As for the launch of Libra cryptocurrency by Facebook, Dr. Qi Zhou thought that from a technical standpoint, Libra does not have enough innovations and that the programming language Move has advantages in the security aspect.We will attend more events in the following weeks, please stay turn.Websitehttps://www.quarkchain.ioTelegramhttps://t.me/quarkchainioTwitterhttps://twitter.com/Quark_ChainMediumhttps://medium.com/quarkchain-officialReddithttps://www.reddit.com/r/quarkchainio/Facebookhttps://www.facebook.com/quarkchainofficial/Discordhttps://discord.me/quarkchain", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Blockchain Technology", "Blockchain Startup", "Quarkchain", "Web3"]}, {"title": "Web3.0: the road ahead for Waves \u2014 Waves Platform", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@wavesplatform/web3-0-the-road-ahead-for-waves-waves-platform-51ee53275241?source=search_post", "author_name": "Waves Platform", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@wavesplatform", "publish_date": "2019-03-12", "last_modified_date": "2019-03-12", "readtime": "4.31", "claps": 139, "voters": 3, "content": "Web3.0: the road ahead for Waves \u2014 Waves PlatformWaves PlatformFollowMar 12 \u00b7 5 min readIt\u2019s the right time to kick-start the next iteration of the web, with smart, decentralised digital services powered by blockchain and the new technologies Waves is building.The concept of decentralization is, as a matter of fact, quite new. Surprisingly, it was first formulated around the 19th century, together with the concept of centralization itself. Before that time people did not really give much thought to the general principles of the things they built, be it society\u2019s structure or technology. Creation of huge nation states drew attention to the general principles of society structure, and brought about suspicion that rigid vertical structures had their own drawbacks. Rigid hierarchy and chain of command do make a lot of sense in many situations, but this always creates centralized point of failure, making systems vulnerable and corruptible.In the late 20th century technology started to have an overwhelming effect on the development of society. Computer networks became the veins through which society\u2019s blood flows; tech that we build has a huge impact on the society we live in. The concept of decentralized technology started to take shape in the late 70s, in the form of distributed computing and consensus research.The real breakthrough, at least in people\u2019s minds, came with blockchain technology. For the first time in the history of human technology we were able to create truly decentralized systems controlled only by the protocol we feed into them. Blockchain is now more than 10 years old, and although we can\u2019t do all the things we want with it just yet, we can do enough to try and go beyond prototypes and working use-cases. Mass adoption, that Holy Grail of any emerging technology, must be found ASAP, since the time has come. WEB2.0 corporations have come to hold too much power. We did not notice how they gained access to tons of sensitive and valuable big data, and now we have the kind of monopoly that just can\u2019t last.WEB3.0, the concept which emerged at the end of the last century, is finally shaping up in the first real products that unify a host of different technologies (Big Data, AI, IoT\u2026) on a decentralized footing. To kick-start the revolution it is of vital importance to create retail WEB3.0 products and working enterprise applications now. We need to go beyond the crypto-community to make the ideas that emerged within it truly work.We can\u2019t achieve full decentralization just yet, and actually we might never achieve it. To make WEB3.0 a really useful concept we need to understand that the end-goal of WEB3.0 is the creation of robust, transparent, synergetic systems by any means necessary. Decentralizing critical business logic and using centralized tech where we can\u2019t do without it (storage, complicated computation), we are able to create products that can gain mass adoption now, where there\u2019s a real need in a new approach in the systems we are building. Data storage can be enhanced and allow for privacy protection. It\u2019s time to get down to some fancy and sophisticated cryptography, such as homomorphic encryption, and really make it work. In the near future, I\u2019m sure, we\u2019ll also be able to use verifiable computation, using which one can outsource computation to third-parties and obtain verifiable results.The decentralized layer, of course, has to be improved to solve scalability issues that riddle blockchain systems now. Waves\u2019 RIDE smart contracts language update will provide a new approach to decentralized computation and business logic, which is closer to the nature of blockchain systems. It will be on the Waves mainnet by June. Waves-NG maximizes what you can get from on-chain transactions in terms of speed. To go further you need either to move off-chain or create custom sidechains, that process specific sets of transactions. The second approach is closer to our philosophy of getting the maximum from the current technology before moving forward, and it will be implemented in the second half of 2019. Future systems may (and probably should) give up on total network synchronization completely, but there\u2019s still a long way to go, and the current technology is mature enough to disrupt WEB 2.0 architecture.The gateway to our WEB3.0 world is going to be our Waves Keeper. Storing private keys user-side and not trusting any sensitive data to third parties is the key to WEB3, and Keeper does exactly that.The next architecture level is the Decentralized Business logic layer. Sensitive business logic running on smart contracts, encrypted important private data, monetization through tokenization \u2014 it all goes there. Going deeper we arrive at the Centralized Layer, which soaks up WEB3 ideas as well \u2014 data is encrypted, computation is verifiable.Based on this architecture we\u2019re building several applications now, with mass adoption in mind.They tap into diverse markets but are unified by the ideas of tokenization, being accessible to a mass audience, and providing an unparalleled level of transparency.We are building a decentralized voting platform. This is one of the most promising directions for distributed tech. Its usage on the municipal level is starting to happen- and its widespread application is inevitable. Transparent, anonymous and verifiable voting can change the game completely.We build a social network. It might seem too ambitious but this is just the right moment to do it. Privacy preserving, tokenized social network can be a huge leap forward for social interaction. We know how to do it, and you\u2019ll see a prototype this summer.We\u2019re launching Vostok network, our WEB3.0 solution for enterprise. Any implementation of blockchain tech in enterprise is WEB3.0 by default, since only a combination of different technologies, on a decentralized footing, can make sense in a corporate environment. Without it blockchain is just a weird database.We don\u2019t solely do blockchain tech any longer; it is just a part of a bigger picture. We\u2019re becoming the first company that focuses exclusively on monetizable WEB3.0 applications. We want to become one of the first Googles or Facebooks of the future Internet.

Displays of hundreds of logos, put into place to bolster a visionary argument? That was literally the Worst Thing about Web 2.0. We should not put up with it again. It diminishes the work of all the people who work for those companies, the people who are building the small innovations that make the internet better.I think we can all agree that small numbers of large companies have all the power right now. But I think we owe it to be skeptical of anyone who aggressively comes around with an amazing solution to anything. By doing this, they show their hands.

The applications which will run on peer to peer network model with existing networking and routing protocols. The applications where centralized Servers would be obsolete and data will be controlled by the entity whom it belongs, i.e., the User.From Web 1.0 to Web 2.0As we all know, Web 1.0 was static web, and the majority of the information was static and flat. The major shift happened when user-generated content becomes mainstream. Projects such as WordPress, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and others are nominated as Web 2.0 sites where we produce and consume verity of contents such as Video, Audio, Images, etc.The problem, however, was not the content; it was the architecture. The Centralized nature of Web opens up tons of security threats, data gathering of malicious purpose, privacy intrusion and cost as well.The invention of Bitcoin and successful use of decentralized, peer to peer, secure network opens up the opportunity to take a step back and redesign the way our web works. The blockchain is becoming the backbone of the new Web, i.e., Web 3.0.History of blockchainThe invention of blockchain came to the mainstream after the boom of the Bitcoin in 2018. Have a look at the graph below; Bitcoin was at its peak around $20000.But the technologies that power the blockchain network is not something new. These concepts were researched and developed during the \u201990s. Have a look at this timeline.The concepts, such as proof of work, peer to peer network, public key cryptography and consensus algorithms for distributed computing which powers the blockchain have been researched and developed by various universities and computer scientists during the \u201890s.These algorithms and concepts are mature and battle-tested by various organizations. Satoshi Nakamoto combined these technologies and ideas together and built a decentralized, immutable, peer to peer database primarily used for financial purposes.Initially, we all thought that blockchain is suitable only for developed the cryptocurrencies and not for other applications. This thought was challenged when Vitalik buterin Smart contract Etherum cryptocurrency with a new feature.Smart contracts changed everything. The ability to code your own application and run on top of blockchain was the answer to critics who thought that blockchain is only for currencies.\u201cCryptocurrency is a small subset of the blockchain, like the Email of the internet.\u201dThe smart contracts open up the wave of new applications. The viral game cryptokitties showcases blockchain can handle large end applications such as games.Smart contracts are written in Solidity language and can be executed on Etherum network. The protocol and design of Etherum inspired the engineers to build an open source and blockchain agnostic platform to build decentralized applications.DApps protocolsAs I have mentioned earlier, Etherum smart contracts were among the first such technology that can be used to program the decentralized applications. The issue was that smart contracts were written by keeping transactions or money in mind.Developers need multiple tools to build a full-fledged web application such as storage (database, files, index, etc.), message queues or event queues to facilitate the communication. Etherum address these problems by introducing Etherum Swarm and Etherum Whisper projects.As you can see in the diagram above, With Etherum Smart contracts for writing contracts and swarm to store files that can be associated with contracts. To make the decentralized apps communicate with each other, Whisper can be used. All of these can run inside the decentralized browser such as .Swarm is a distributed storage platform for an ethereum stack. The core objective of Swarm is to provide decentralized storage for ethereum public records. Swarm is supposed to save the DApps code base and data associated with it.Swarm allows public participants to pool their storage and bandwidth resources to make the network robust and get paid in Etherum incentives. Fair deal.Ethereum whisper, in a nutshell, is a protocol for DApps running on Etherum blockchain to communicate with each other, similar to message queues or event queues. Whisper provides low-level API\u2019s to support communication between DApps. You can learn more about it .However, do you sense the limitations here? Well, the main issue is that this is entirely Etherum agnostic, i.e., all apps are written and run on top of Etherum blockchain. This change will increase the size of the chain significantly, and scalability will be an issue.Other than scalability, adaptability will be an issue as well. We need a smooth shift from the centralized web to decentralized web. A shift where masses do not need to change everything for the sake of the decentralized web.This is where our new protocol comes in, called the IPFS (Interplanetary file system) stack by Protocols labs.Protocols labs is dedicated to building the decentralized web which runs in parallel to TCP/IP stack. This will make the shift from existing web to web 3.0 very smooth, and masses do not need to make a significant change to use the web 3.0.Here is the stack.Rings a bell? This stack looks pretty similar to TCP/IP protocol layers. Let\u2019s learn about this in detail.The IPFS stack is divided into three essential layers:Let\u2019s learn about each of them in detail.Networking LayerOne of the core challenges in the decentralized web is the peer to peer network and designing the protocols which work in a peer to peer network in parallel to the centralized system.The Libp2p project addresses this challenge with protocols labs. Libp2p provides the modular stack which one can use to build peer to peer network in conjunction with existing protocols such as WebRTC or any new transport layer protocols. Hence, Libp2p is transported agnostics.Features of libp2p:Libp2p is a modular networking stack. You can use all of it or use part of the stack to build your application.Libp2p provides transport and peer to peer protocols to build large, robust and scalable network application.Libp2p is transport protocol agnostics. It can work with TCP, UDP, WebRTC, WebSockets, and UDP.Libp2p offers a number of modules such as transport interface, discovery, distributed hash lookup, peer discovery, and routing.Libp2p offers built-in encryption to prevent eavesdropping.Libp2p offers built-in roaming features so that your service can switch networks without any intervention and loss of packets.Libp2p is the solution upon which the networking layer of peer to peer can be built.Data definition and naming layerContent addressing through hashes is widely used in a distributed system. We use hash-based content addressing in Git, cryptocurrencies, etc. The same is also used in peer to peer networking.IPLD provides a unified namespace for all hash-based protocals. Using IPLD, data can be traversed across various protocols to explore and view the data spread across peer to peer network.IPNS is a system to create a mutable address to the contents stored on IPFS. The reason why they are mutable because the addresses of the content change every time the content changes.Data LayerThe topmost layer in this stack is the data layer. Interplanetary file system or IPFS is the peer to peer hypermedia protocol. IPFS provides a way to store and retrieve the data across peer to peer network.IPFS uses IPNS and Libp2p to create, name and distribute content across peer to peer network.Anyone can become an IPFS peer and start looking for the content using hashes. IPFS peer does not need to store every data; they only need to store data created by them or the one they have searched in the past.Features of IPFS:IPFS provides peer to peer hypermedia protocols for web 3.0.IPFS can work with existing protocols and browsers. This gives a smooth transition from centralized web to web 3.0.IPFS uses Libp2p to support peer to peer networking.IPFS data is cryptographically secure.IPFS can save tons of bandwidth in streaming services. For in-depth details, read this white paper.IPFS is under development, and there are some fantastic applications built by developers that are running on top of the IPFS. One of the applications of my choice is . This is a decentralized version of YouTube with built-in incentive and reward feature provided by Steem blockchain.IPFS also trying to solve the incentive issue. We can\u2019t expect every person connected to the internet to act as a peer. In order to provide an incentive to those who participate and contribute value to the network, IPFS has created a coin called Filecoin which can be paid to peers in the network by the user.ConclusionDecentralized web or Web 3.0 is the future. There is a need to design a robust, secure and peer to peer network to tackle the issue in existing web. Etherum and IPFS are leading the path to develop the development suite for developers like us to start developing core applications that are needed to make a smooth transition from the existing web to decentralized web.Originally published at https://readwrite.com, by Shahid Shaikh, on April 16, 2019.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Web", "Tech", "Web3", "Dapps"]}, {"title": "Welcome to the Wild Wild Web3", "post_link": "https://medium.com/hackernoon/welcome-to-the-wild-wild-web3-4dcb6eb0bb75?source=search_post", "author_name": "Bilal Ghalib", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@bilalghalib", "publish_date": "2019-06-19", "last_modified_date": "2019-06-26", "readtime": "9.98", "claps": 17, "voters": 4, "content": "Welcome to the Wild Wild Web3Bilal GhalibFollowJun 19 \u00b7 10 min readBuild Your Own Crypto Incentive Schemes. Take your blockchain project to the \u201creal world\u201dDisclaimer: I\u2019m hosting a free Bootcamp with Elk.cc, I hope this post excites you to dive deeper into learning about blockchain and IoT with me!The picture above is a photo of people at the Elk office, where I work, they are doing pushups competing for a crypto token I made called the ELK Coin. Is the ELK coin worthless? Perhaps, although I sometimes offer people favors if they send me some. The curious thing is the dynamics that start taking place when you make a claim of value and have provable transactions.What sorts of incentive schemes can you design when Smart Contracts connect with embedded systems? These are some of the questions I\u2019m opening up with my provocations at Elk and I am opening it up for a larger dialog with this blog post and the bootcamp I will be running next week.The best way to understand a transforming world is to be a part of developing it. In this tutorial I want to go through my process in helping me build mental models about the decentralized web, sometimes known as Web3. This tutorial will help you build a decentralized mindset while taking you step by step in building your own token based office incentive scheme.Web3 brings with it a few new abilities, let\u2019s break down what that means:Matrix of new abilitiesRather than a bunch of facts, let\u2019s break it down practically. by making our own Ethereum based crypto-token and create awesome incentives by gamifying the Elk office. To join in on this adventure, you will need:Your own ethereum walletSome ether (the currency of ethereum)30 mins.Step One \u2014 Get A WalletGet a wallet, the easy way:Install the Meta Mask plugin for Firefox, Chrome or use the onboard plugin in the new Brave browser.For step by step details on how to do that please follow this great tutorial.Get a wallet, the mathematical way:Some amazing mathematics underlies a lot of the special abilities that are now possible to do with the world of Web3. Although you don\u2019t need to understand it to be able to use it, the reason I am including this here is that it\u2019s imperative to intuit how it all works without central servers managing the addresses. And because learning is awesome!For Ethereum, you are using the features of beautiful graph:to generate a public/private key pair. A keypair allows you to share secret messages with people online and also to prove that you intended to sign digital files. This lies at the heart of decentralized tech and we want to be sure that you don\u2019t miss out on understanding it. Ethereum\u2019s addresses are derived by taking a hash of the public key. A hash is a function that creates a unique fixed length string from various inputs.If you\u2019d like to generate your own Ethereum address by generating your public/private key pair and hashing your public key, you can follow this tutorial, the code here. If you\u2019d like to nerd out a little more on how you can create a one way function from the elliptic curve above, read this.The public/private key pair is an essential element of unlocking your wallet and sending funds, connected to the identification of your Ethereum address, and is how you can sign and prove intent since only you have access to these keys. So keep em safe!Step Two \u2014 Get Some Ether.So by now you should now have a funny looking string of numbers like: 0x21aB0B3527326dcA4469245654Cf881F5F7a8c5eA unique feature of writing and interacting with the blockchain is that since you don\u2019t own the computer running the code and you\u2019re not paying for a hosting server to run the code for you you\u2019ll have to incentivize the decentralized network to host and run your contract. That means every time you want to publish or run your decentralized code, you need to pay for it. So, let\u2019s get you some test ether to play with.Click your Meta Mask icon to open up the plugin. Click the top area that says \u201cMain Ethereum Network\u201d and change it to the \u201cRopsten Test Network\u201d then can head here: https://faucet.metamask.io/ and click \u201crequest one ether\u201d. Once the transaction is complete, click the Meta Mask icon and check out your brand new shiny ether!Step Three \u2014 Publish your contract.Amazing! You have your wallet, you have your ether, now let\u2019s make our token contract! As we mentioned previously Ethereum is a platform which has its own native coin that goes by Ether. Ether can be viewed as the fuel which runs contract code living on the blockchain. Since we are using computational resources from other people\u2019s computers using arbitrary code lengths we need a way to charge a variable amount. This amount is called \u201cgas\u201d \u2014 analogous to the gas you might put into your car to make it go.To make our own incentives scheme and currency for the Elk office, let\u2019s consider what functions and features may be necessary:Limited supply of tokens to create scarcityTokens can be sent and receivedNumber of tokens in contract can be viewed\u2026Now we can take each of these features and write our own smart contract, although since this code is also managing tokens that may have value at some point it\u2019s best to use audited contracts that take into consideration loopholes and bugs that we may inadvertently introduce.Open Zeppelin has created an open source and audited implementation of the ERC20 standard. The ERC20 standard has previously been discussed by Vitalic, the founder of Ethereum, on github, on the community forum reddit and elsewhere before it settled into its current shape. The reason I mention this history is to emphasize that the design consideration for standards are communally generated and your voice matters!So, now that we know a bit about the background of ERC20, let\u2019s make our first token!First open the remix editor in a separate tab. Now to keep things simple, I\u2019ve gobbled together the code from all the various modules from the Zeppelin implementation of the standard into one code blob to make copying and pasting simple. You can find that blob here in this paste bin. This is all the code required to make your own token. Copy this file and paste it into ballot.sol in the remix editor, you can rename this file exampleToken.sol, or whatever you\u2019d like.To prevent errors, it is best to select the compiler that matches the code, you can see that on the very first line: \u201cpragma solidity ^0.5.2;\u201d \u2014 choose the 0.5.2 commit from the \u201cSelect new compiler\u201d drop down.Now let\u2019s customize your token for your application. Scroll down to the bottom of the code I shared and find this section:contract SimpleToken is ERC20, ERC20Detailed {uint8 public constant DECIMALS = 2;uint256 public constant INITIAL_SUPPLY = 1000 * (10 ** uint256(DECIMALS));constructor () public ERC20Detailed(\u201cSimpleToken\u201d, \u201cSIM\u201d, DECIMALS) {_mint(msg.sender, INITIAL_SUPPLY);}You can change the name from SimpleToken and the short name SIM to whatever you\u2019d like. Then you can modify the INITIAL_SUPPLY variable to be however many tokens you want, DECIMALS to however many decimal places you want after it. For instance if you want 10,000 tokens that can be divided into \u201cpennies\u201d you can say 10000 for the supply and 2 for the decimals.This way, once you deploy your contract, your total supply function will return: \u201c1000000\u201d, and your DECIMALS function will return: \u201c2\u201d. Hooray!Now we are ready to publish your contract! Follow these steps carefully:Right underneath the compiler selector you will see a button that says \u201cstart to compile\u201d, if it hasn\u2019t already compiled your code, please push this button.Next, click the \u201cRun\u201d tab in the upper right corner of your window. Select Injected Web3 (this means Meta Mask for our purposes) and lastly be sure to pick the name of your token as the contract to publish. If you haven\u2019t changed the code, it should be called SimpleToken, if you have you will see your token\u2019s name here. Don\u2019t worry about the other names (ERC20, SafeMath, etc\u2026) it will refer to the other compiled contract modules as it needs, we only need to run our token\u2019s contract.Now comes the fun part! Playing with your token and sending some to your friends!Add your token to Meta Mask!Once you hit deploy, it will be deployed using the account selected in the drop down above, it should be the one that you created and fueled with Ropsten Ether. The Meta Mask plugin will pop up and ask you to confirm. Now since this is going up and actually going to reside on a living test network it will take some time for the miners to confirm your transaction, please be patient. Once it\u2019s confirmed, that means you paid enough gas for the miners to deem adding your code to the block worthy. Hooray! You should now see a confirmation in the debug window.Scroll down in the \u201cRun\u201d tab and you should see your token in the \u201cDeployed contracts\u201d list. Open it up and you can start clicking on the blue colored buttons to interact with your contract.To be sure your contract is up for the world to see, look inside the debug screen for your Etherscan link. Etherscan link is a viewer for the content publicly viewable on the blockchain.Hello Nur TokenHere is my link for my newly created Nur token.You will probably want to use Meta Mask to send and receive tokens more easily and to help others also send/recieve tokens. First thing to do is figure out what your contract\u2019s address is. This is important to note, your contract\u2019s address is not your address. It is its own entity which if programmed can make its own decisions. You can find your contract in a few places:Inside the remix editor, right by the name of your deployed contract is a \u201ccopy\u201d symbol, pressing that will copy the contracts address to your clipboard.If you go to the Etherscan page from the debug console, you can see the contract address in this form: \u201c[Contract 0xc84a29bf11934172131067503a5762aa19d18429 Created]\u201dCopy your address and click on the Meta Mask plugin. Click on the three bar sandwich icon on the upper left and scroll till you see \u201cAdd Token\u201d on the bottom. Click it and then on the next window select \u201cCustom Token\u201d and add the contract address you copied from the previous step. It should automatically fill out the name and number of decimals. Once you click next you\u2019ll see your account is now set up to send tokens!So now here is where the fun starts. The incredible thing about these tokens is that when you send them to others and once they own them \u2014 you can no longer take them back. They can prove to the world they have them on etherscan, all without having to trust a central server, a bank, or even the person who made the token! This opens up avenues for exploring incentivization schemes and games. I am using the ELK token I created at the office to challenge the team here to walk up the stairs, solve puzzles, and other fun tasks and I send them ELK in exchange.Photographic proof of coming to the office early:And \u201cproof of workout\u201d:Next steps:This is only the beginning. Currently I am coordinating documenting challenges people propose and the completion of those challenges in a shared spreadsheet and verifying using photos and conversations in the office, lots of in-person trust.This is a centralized point of failure, not automated, and isn\u2019t distributing incentives to the whole team. Not to mention I personally am bottleneck needing to be sent evidence of actions and needing to go to Metamask and send everyone the right amount of our token. I\u2019m proposing to expand the office gamification project using an ERC721 token specification. Do you have thoughts on how to create a better system? How would you create an in office token gamification scheme?Most importantly, with these new super powers that the technologies that power Web3 unleash, what will you create? What happens when we connect self executing code with electronic systems? The verification that can be proven on the blockchain gets messy when you\u2019re dealing with hackable electronics. What can we do about this? These are open questions and I\u2019ve set up a short bootcamp to help people curious about Blockchain and IoT to develop the basic skillset to start interrogating the space.To learn more and join our free 3 week bootcamp, check out elk.cc/bootcampI\u2019m the host of the workshop and I also work for Elk, a company making an open source board to simplify connecting the physical world to the blockchain world. Excited to have you join our learning journey!Schedule of events, join us free at: elk.cc/bootcampI hope this tutorial has whet your appetite for learning. The intersection of blockchain in the real world to affect incentives, create and share digital/physical value and lead to trusted human-human, human-computer and computer-computer transactions is going to grow once the blockchain connects with embedded systems and IoT. What that world looks like, we don\u2019t know. What I do know is that it needs more voices from people willing to learn, experiment and build these systems and that\u2019s what this tutorial and the bootcamp is all about.

W3F Research delves into a wide variety of outstanding research questions including scalability solutions, interchain message passing, and decentralised messaging. Read more W3F Research here.The following notes were taken at a two-day W3F Research workshop focusing on the Polkadot protocol last month in Berlin. Attendees included: Jeff Burdges, Peter Czaban, Robert Habermeier, Arkadiy Paronyan, Fatemeh Shirazi, Alistair Stewart, and Gavin Wood.The researchers managed to nail down a majority of the outstanding protocol components required for the initial version of Polkadot as well as the order in which these components would be implemented.The workshop focused on the Polkadot protocol, including:Interchain message passingBlock production mechanismNominated proof of stakeRandomness beaconWorkshop TerminologyPoV: Proof of Validity (a block candidate plus all witness data in order to let a stateless (light) client execute it)AG: Availability Guarantor (validators holding an erasure coded piece)GRANDPA: Block finality gadget in PolkadotWorkshop NotesThe workshop began addressing initial questions about buffering (whether it should be done and how) and defining the order of events that lead to a block being created in Polkadot. The researchers settled on having a limit on the size and number of messages that can be sent by each parachain and enabling the blocking function whereby a parachain can block another parachain from sending messages it messages.PoV Block is execution proof witness data. This might include:Output messages (as message bundle hash preimages); andExternal data (\u201ctransactions\u201d, \u201cextrinsics\u201d or any other data extrinsic to Polkadot)Witness (cryptographic proof statements of data validity)New header (probably only the case for verification-only STFs like zkSTARKs or whatever)Parachain Block Creation and Messaging ProcessCollator has transaction poolCollator runs relay chain light client to determine the latest relay chain headCollator tracks parachain head and that parachain\u2019s input queue as a set of hashes of message-bundles (which requires tracking all parachain\u2019s output queues since the last time the parachain accepted input)Collator retrieves the outgoing messages from other parachains or collator queries AGs (based on relay chain data) in order to get actual message data from bundlesCollator creates block candidate from transaction pool, previous head, messages and any other data (e.g. inherents)Collator builds a PoV block candidate for this parachainCollator distributes it to all PVs (for its parachain)Parachain Validatorproduces attestations on some subset of valid PoV candidates that it receives and redistributes to other PVs of their parachain and BAsBlock Author selects a set of PoV candidates, at most one for each parachain, which are fully attested by their groupBlock Author distributes the relay chain block candidate to other validatorsAnother set of topics discussed included the assumptions we\u2019re making in designing Polkadot and how Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS) would work.Assumptions:Block Producer (BP) set could be huge; doesn\u2019t matter too much if offline, could be low-staked.GRANDPA Validators (Grandpas) <= 1000Parachain Validators (PV) are a subset of GrandpasAvailability Guarantors (AG) same set as GrandpasNominated Proof of StakeValidators declare their desired stake they want to deposit and desired interest rate (fee)Nominators declare their desired stake (the total amount of stake they want to invest), preferred validators, and desired interest rate (fee)A solution is an assignment of nominators to validators and the amount of stake each nominator needs to invest in those selected validatorsThere exists an algorithm to measure how good a solution isN blocks prior to a session start, the problem is fixed from the current nominator/validator declarationsSolutions may submitted by block producers as an inherentSolutions must be better by a substantial margin (e.g. 5% on the least slashable validator) than previousFinally included solution gets paid some reward; reward inversely proportional to solution size.Changes to current stakingReward should directly reflect risk (i.e. slash ratio)Historical session delegations (or the changes thereof) should be recorded in state for later slashing (to avoid big proofs). Will need to be recorded per session under the new NPoS scheme, but should generally fit into around 1MB on-chain per session; 90 sessions worth would need to be recorded (for one era).BP set should be divorced from GRANDPA/AG setThe workshop also delved into the Polkadot randomness beacon and the scheme for ensuring availability of parachain data.Follow the W3F Research forum to read more.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["W3f Research", "Web3 Foundation Research", "Polkadot", "Polkadot Network"]}, {"title": "NKN and Ankr Partner to Build Web 3.0", "post_link": "https://medium.com/nknetwork/nkn-and-ankr-partner-to-build-web-3-0-eaf2760dc0a9?source=search_post", "author_name": "NKN", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@NKN_ORG", "publish_date": "2019-07-23", "last_modified_date": "2019-07-23", "readtime": "1.88", "claps": 11, "voters": 2, "content": "NKN and Ankr Partner to Build Web 3.0NKNFollowJul 23 \u00b7 2 min readJuly 23rd, 2019 - San Francisco, CaliforniaNKN is proud to announce a new collaboration with Ankr, a distributed compute platform that uses idle computing resources in data centers and edge devices. Both NKN and Ankr have adopted a sharing economy business model that seeks to leverage the unused resources that are available in today\u2019s Internet while advocating for a decentralized web. However, to unlock the full potential of the decentralized web, we need to provide a foundation for the next generation of applications and services. By combining NKN\u2019s networking capabilities with Ankr\u2019s compute resources, we can work together to enable the decentralized web 3.0.The decentralized web starts with infrastructure and one of the fastest growing segments is edge computing. The global edge computing market is expected to reach $3.2B by 2025 and many Telecom carriers are looking to incorporate edge computing into their network architecture to serve new gaming, IoT, and autonomous driving applications. However, these expensive and vital edge resources need to be maximized for the carrier and for the customer. Together NKN and Ankr software running on carrier edge computing can manage unused network and compute resources for new applications and revenue streams.In addition to products and solutions, NKN and Ankr will be cooperating in joint community and marketing efforts. This includes activities such as marketing campaigns, live AMAs, as hosted events that showcase our joint solutions. In addition, joint hackathon and developer outreach by the two teams as well as other partners, can enable any developers to build Web 3.0 applications.We are excited to be working with Ankr to build the decentralized web3.0. Bringing together crowdsourced computing and networking resources will provide the infrastructure for new innovative applications and services. Together, we can ensure that everyone has access to secure, private, low cost, and rich Internet experience of the future.About AnkrAnkr Network aims to establish a more open cloud ecosystem by building a distributed computing platform that could leverage idle computing resources in an efficient marketplace.

That is the sad truth of Web 2.0, companies which monetize our data based on manipulation.Why Web 3.0 is differentThe new web is based on protocols that are architecturally decentralized. There is still a logically centralized data layer. Nobody owns your data. The data lives in the protocol and there can me many apps that utilize that data, also called decentralized apps or dapps.So whats the difference? While there can be multiple dapps offering the similar value on the same data, the main difference lies somewhere else. It lies in the mechanism design of these protocols. Centralized Web 2.0 companies have tried to manipulate our behaviour while Web 3.0 protocols strive to create game theoretical incentives that make use the network.

Design Thinking for BlockchainsHosted by Patara \u2014 Burak Arikan, Cenk Dolek & Engin ErdoganThe Design Thinking for Blockchain Node introduces design thinking into Web3 stack as a collective and creative process for protocol design.Considering blockchains will have a significant impact on all walks of life, protocol design should be a multi-disciplinary activity and include a variety of inputs in the conception stage to prevent creator biases being baked into platforms. The team behind the Node developed a unique methodology with this purpose by combining elements of design thinking, network science, and crypto economics. All disciplines and experience levels are invited to partake in designing new blockchains for a variety of domains.This workshop is a people-first systems design exercise: starting with mapping ecosystems and journeys, identifying pain points of centralization and opportunities to disintermediate. Participants will learn and utilize hands-on design thinking methods including stakeholder analysis, network modeling, journey mapping, and structured brainstorming. In the end, participants will present their group work, collect feedback, and discuss expected outcomes and implications.Learn more about the Node: https://medium.com/@erdogan/design-thinking-for-blockchains-ded1d6cabe53Node 02.

Nature 2.0 can be created with the combination of Web3 infrastructure and AI, enabling nature to interact with the modern constructs of our society. When nature can be self-sovereign, make decisions and business models, it will be able to create economic value which enables it to sustain long into the future, autonomously. As creatures who are fundamentally dependant on the well-being of nature, automating the preservation and regrowth of it ought to be one of our main priorities. Throughout the Web3 summit we are proud to feature some of the leading thinkers in AI, DAO, and nature restoration technology, who will host workshops in the node throughout the event. Our goal is to attract bright people who want to make an impact, and equip and inspire them to implement Nature 2.0.Node 03. Decentralized ArtHosted by Sam Brown \u2014 Building A World; Exhibition curated by Alexine RodenhuisThe Web3 Art Makerspace is hosted by Sam Brown the artist behind explodingdog which started back in 2000. For a short while he was kinda internet famous; he is internet normal now. At the Decentralized Art Node a series of collaborative drawings will be created by the community. Each individual drawing will be done with the idea that it will be attached adjacent to one of the other drawings on the wall. Take a sheet of paper, learn more about the collective rules and guidelines (or adjust them with the community when needed), think and draw in a way you\u2019ve probably haven\u2019t before. Close your notebook. Be creative.Collective Creativity is an exhibition which brings together the work of six international artists who are examining ideas and applications of decentralisation. Whether practical or ideological, the underpinnings of decentralisation are grounded in an ethos of collective action and purposeful distribution of power away from a central authority. Through their distinctive practices, each artist approaches these principles of deliberate dispersion in a unique way, further contributing to an expanding conversation about the potential futures of artistic practice. Together the works presented represent a snapshot of an ecosphere where creative action is communal, united and shared. The artists featured are:Anne de BoerGrayson Earle and the Dark Inquiry collectiveSarah FriendAaron KoblinCullen Miller and Gabriel DunneThe exhibition is curated by Alexine Rodenhuis.Node 04. UX \u2014 User ExperienceHosted by CONFLUX \u2014 Aqueel MohammadDesign is an organic collection of interconnected practices that create value while examining our world through an empathic lens. It is imperative that we engage and empower designers in the ecosystem at all levels of the dialog through; Mechanism design, Systems design, and most importantly Experience design, to ensure that we do not marginalize any segments when developing entirely new paradigms of human interactions and connectivity. Prioritization of intelligent design will be key to bringing awareness to the true potential of decentralized technologies and bridging the gap between usability and user adoption.The goal of the UX node is to catalyze and leverage these opportunities for cross pollination with the utilization of human-centered design methodologies, engaging the diverse set of stakeholders working on the core components of the decentralised web and Web3 technology stack to participate equally in helping solve the UX issue that persist.Node 05. Technical TeachingsHosted by KI Decentralized \u2014 Eric Holst & Wilfried KoppThe Technical Teachings Node will provide a series of teach-ins focused on the building of various decentralized protocols and solving problems in relation to them.

With the growing number of browser extensions, mobile browsers and applications with that same goal, the community got together to standardize a privacy-oriented, more secure way to bridge those two worlds. In our session, we will explain the changes Dapps should make to conform to EIPs 1103 and 1193 and be ethereum enabled and not tied to one specific browser or extension.ERC777 \u2014 Jacques DafflonShort talk and AMA on all you need to know about ERC777.Enterprise Blockchain Solutions \u2014 Problems and TradeoffsBigchainDB \u2014 Gautam DhamejaThe process of building and deploying enterprise blockchain solutions brings a new set of problems with it \u2014 key and identity management, (how much) decentralization, privacy, scalability and so on. It\u2019s hard to solve all of them together but there are some clean tradeoffs which can help with prioritizing some of these problems based on use-case scenarios. The session will focus on some of these enterprise blockchain scenarios and how we can achieve these tradeoffs.Node 06. DApp CityHosted by Streamr \u2014 Juuso Takalainen, Eric Andrews, Miroslav Pokrovskii, Jarno Marttila, Weilei Yu & Amandine Flachs.DApp City Node is focused on the theme around smart city, with IoT and blockchain at its core. There are many challenges slowing down the progress in smart city deployment, including identity management and trust/less mechanism for millions of IoT devices, open vs proprietary data exchange, protocol standards, segregation of responsibilities/concerns. During the three days at Web3 Summit, the goal is not to find a solution to all these challenges but to create a space to foster open discussion and offer relevant workshops in the topics of open-source hardware roadmap, IoT-blockchain integration, AI/self-driving cars accident resolution. Lastly, we will provide plenty of IoT hardware and blockchain mentoring for anyone interested in doing some hands-on hacking.Node 07. Decentralize NOW!Hosted by Griff Green.Software Development (Bounties & Beer on Monday and Tuesday night!)This summit is overflowing with teams of superstars decentralizing all the things\u2026 but why? What will this decentralized future look like when we get there? This node is going to cover the current state of progress in this movement, discuss its importance, and dream about the end game. You can help get us there faster! At DECENTRALIZE NOW! you will have the opportunity to move the movement forward!This node is going to have classes on coding, demos, workshops, and lots of roundtable discussions covering Transparency vs. Privacy, Scaling, DAOs, Open Source Culture, and the decentralization of:MoneyIdentityHardwareData AvailabilityGovernanceICOsCharityCommerceInternet Access (Mesh Networks)Node 08. Security NodeHosted by solidified.io \u2014 Nick Munoz-McDonald, Adam Kolar & Fabio Hildebrand.The Security Node is intended to be the area at Web3 Summit where the security community can gather. There will be a number of sessions running during the summit, some examples include:Bring your code: toolbuilders will showcase their tools by analysing the attendee\u2019s smart contracts.Crowd Audit: live auditing, bugs found will be presented by whoever finds it.Protocol security sessionBug hunting tournament: a set of vulnerable smart contracts will be provided, in a gamified setting that awards points to players. Advanced players will also be incentivized to include their own challenges, or their own code with a bounty if an invariant is reached by a participant.Bug showcases: auditors and specialists will show curious bugs found, underhanded code, interesting discussions, etc.Node 09. VRHosted by James Levy & Julia Schofield.The VR Node brings immersive experiences to the Web3 Summit to provide attendees with a short break to relax and reboot. The experiences featured at the VR Node will be primarily focused on the themes of music, art, and creativity. There will also be documentary themed VR experiences that offer 360-degree views into locations throughout the world.Node 10. Pop-up NodeHosted by anyone or any project that wants to engage with the attendees.This Node is open to anyone or any project that wants to engage with the attendees of the Summit. Whether this is a short talk, Q&A, AMA, technical lesson, arts and crafts activity or indeed anything relevant to decentralization, the Pop-up Node provides an opportunity for you to make an offering to the community.

Getting it done took us way less time and effort than we initially estimated, and are quite content with the end result.For those of you unfamiliar with Substrate, it is a development framework, which makes it incredibly easy to build blockchains; the framework is 100% open-source. For us, having a Substrate implementation, means greatly improved scalability, more flexibility and ultimately \u2014 an enhanced user experience.This implementation will also include the AdEx Registry: a component designed to curate a high-quality list of public AdEx validators. It accomplishes this by requiring a ADX tokens to be staked as a warranty against potential misbehavior. We chose Polkadot and Substrate because the Registry needs to be able to sustain high transaction throughput in case of a challenge, and because of the upgradability and governance benefits of the Polkadot ecosystem.\u201cWith proper documentation and usability improvements, the combination of Rust and Substrate could become the easiest, fastest and safest way to create pretty much any type of blockchain application,\u201d commented our CEO Ivo Georgiev.The next steps would be to launch a testnet, and to work further on the implementation with tooling, JS libraries, CLI, etc. We are also hoping that we\u2019ll be able to provide the W3F team with valuable feedback, and we\u2019re looking forward to a long and successful collaboration.Substrate ResourcesWatch Gavin Wood demo Substrate at the Web3 Summit.

Come vivessimo costantemente il paradosso di \u201cI robot\u201d! La stessa antologia del grande Asimov, infatti, era basata sulle contraddizioni e sulle apparenti falle delle macchine, quasi a giustificare la superiorit\u00e0 dell\u2019uomo per esorcizzare delle paure che, col passare degli anni e con lo sviluppo delle tecnologie, rischiano di diventare esse stesse ataviche.Nel momento in cui le industrie sono lanciatissime nel definire protocolli per lo scambio di informazioni fra gli oggetti, sembra che l\u2019uomo voglia smarcarsi da una possibile commistione con essi.

Se desideriamo che ci venga offerto un vestito su misura, costruito e spedito a casa, dobbiamo indicare molti elementi (la qualit\u00e0 del tessuto, le misure, il colore, e poi l\u2019indirizzo, la carta di credito, ecc.)

Brave boasts that this system improves user privacy greatly, since it also includes blocking of third-party trackers from traditional ad software by Google, Facebook, and peers.I\u2019ve said before I\u2019m a big fan of this project. But in fairness, it is worth noting that Brave has its share of critics as well, like this guy whose tweet caught my attention today:\u200cTo translate his complaints here from nerdspeak into plain English, they boil down to the following two points, which others have raised as well:Brave is just inserting itself as a new middleman in this new ad ecosystem, very much akin to Google and Facebook in the old one.The payments aspect of Brave requires users to manage their deposits and withdrawals of fiat currency funds through the finance startup Uphold. From Brave\u2019s standpoint, this helps with regulatory compliance, especially regarding \u201cknow your customer\u201d rules. (KYC for short.) But some crypto purists say it defeats the purpose of a tokenized economy in which users would be better off managing their own funds without traditional banking mechanisms altogether.I\u2019m glad people are raising these concerns, even if I don\u2019t view them as fatal flaws for Brave myself. In short, I think both issues are imminently addressable with future iterations of the Brave software. That\u2019s especially true since Brave is using an entirely open source development process, with no secret algorithms akin to those of the big boys.That said, hey, the Brave team is made up of imperfect human beings. It has been \u2014 and will continue to be \u2014 very healthy for people to ask tough questions and hold them accountable over time. We all basically failed to do that as users of Google and Facebook 10 or 15 years ago, when they were overly lionized as benevolent bearers of software fairy dust, so let\u2019s not do that again. It invites bad behavior.One other really surprising impression struck me as I read the tweet traffic about Brave today. By using the browser as a central hub to remake the ad market, Brave is in some ways effectively emulating a much older startup \u2014 America Online.Think about it. In its late-90\u2019s heyday, AOL made \u201cportal\u201d software that created a controlled context for each user\u2019s experience of the internet. Most content was free, but some required payment \u2014 via AOL billing, of course. And the system also stored and controlled your online identity.Except for being open source software, and the inclusion of a few modern updates like a crypto wallet, Brave basically does a lot of the same stuff. The company is a portal play, ultimately.Mind you, I don\u2019t necessarily see that as a bad thing. At least AOL had a simpler, more transparent relationship with its users than later tech giants have. You paid for AOL directly \u2014 not by making some byzantine trade-off of your personal information that no one really understands \u2014 and you got connected to the internet in return. That was it.If Brave and other Web 3.0 startups can restore that sort of straightforward approach to users \u2014 but of course implement it in a more modern way \u2014 they\u2019ll score a big win in my book. A semi-centralized solution like the Brave browser is after all still relatively more decentralized \u2014 key qualifier \u2014 than what 99 percent of web users are currently experiencing on Big Tech\u2019s platforms.

It\u2019s about living with intention. Warning\u2026the following ideas are only half-baked, but I needed to get them out.I am starting to wonder if choosing a blockchain or a Web3.0 approach is actually as much a lifestyle choice as a technological choice.Leaving aside the naming challenge (is it blockchain, crypto, or Web3.0?), I think it represents a movement of people who want to live with intention, self-discipline, and personal agency.If THAT message can get refined and promoted, and not the one about all of the technical virtues of the tech, I wonder if there are groups of people who would be more open to hearing the larger story and engaging?Web2.0 has led to an Epidemic of \u201cDigital Diabetes\u201dWe have all seen where Web2.0 got us.The current platforms are manufactured for maximum engagement, creating a dopamine stream of addiction. It leads to poor choices of time, stunted intellectual development, and ever more fantastic claims designed as \u2018click-bait.\u2019Back in 2010, Nicolas Carr wrote a book entitled, The Shallows: What the Internet Is Doing to Our Brains . You can gather its hypothesis immediately. At the time, it was widely derided within tech circles for its supposed sensationalism and over-reaction.Now, 10 years later, in a \u201cpost-truth\u201d era with teenagers addicted to their phones, I am not so sure he was wrong.I see it in my own house and we see it all across society. We are just beginning to understand the implications and anyone who has paid attention to global politics recently knows that there are many.Societies with an abundance of physical resources have a growing physical obesity problem.Societies with an abundance of digital resources have a growing information obesity problem.The Short Story of High Fructose Corn SyrupAs I was thinking through some of these ideas, I started to wonder about how we got here.I started with high fructose corn syrup.It turns out that High Fructose Corn Syrup was commercialized in the early 1970s as a response to growing geo-political change.Oversimplifying it a lot, political upheaval in sugar producing nations created a supply crunch in the US, driving the need for a technology-driven alternative to provide Americans with something sweet that wasn\u2019t expensive.What started off as a solution to one problem ended up becoming the cause of another, even bigger, problem.Today, with the Internet effectively controlled by a few massive corporations that do not have the best welfare of every individual as a core value, billions of people are in the process of abdicating their rights to personal choice and freedoms.I could go on for pages about the power of Alexa and Google to manipulate you through the answers it gives to your questions, Facebook to affect what you think and buy given the newsfeed, and Apple by preventing certain apps from running on their phones.Combine all of this with Big Data/AI, etc. and it\u2019s not difficult to imagine how are lives will be controlled by algorithms of which we are not even aware.An Alternative Digital LifestyleAny trend has many causes, but over the past few years, we have seen an explosion in the number of people doing yoga and meditation and choosing a vegetarian/ vegan diet, just to name a few.Given the recent IPO of Beyond Meat (even if it did get a bit irrational), it\u2019s clear that investors think this trend is here to stay.I suspect that this is how many people choose to react to their own growing awareness to the unhealthy elements of the \u201cmainstream\u201d lifestyle, which has led to so many health problems, both physical and mental.I suspect that this is where Web3.0 has a chance to really shine.One of the more interesting marketing moves I have seen recently is from Blockstack, which put up an ad outside of Google\u2019s headquarters. It was a \u201cpoke the beast\u201d type of move that I am not 100% sure is worth the money now, but I could be wrong (after all, I\u2019m blogging about it now, so the ROI is clearly huge, right? \ud83d\ude09Can\u2019t be evil.This message is now displayed outside Google HQ in Mountain View. pic.twitter.com/BVK5SPaNet- Muneeb Ali (@muneeb) June 19, 2019But what I think IS brilliant about the billboard is that, it builds on the theme of \u201cWeb3.0 as lifestyle brand.\u201dAs in, you either want to be part of a movement that says \u201cdon\u2019t be evil,\u201d but is constantly pulled in the direction of evil in the name of revenue.Or you want to be part of a movement that literally cannot be evil.And if you choose the \u201cI want to be part of a group of people that literally cannot be evil,\u201d then you are making a lifestyle choice.You are choosing to take control of your personal, digital destiny.You are choosing to ensure and protect the digital freedoms of others from unknown, unseen, monopolistic powers that don\u2019t care about you\u2026they care about your wallet.Would you trust Coca-Cola to make dinner for your family?Self-Discipline and Self-Control is a ChoiceI have been reading a lot of stoic philosophy recently in preparation for a trip to Greece later this summer to study the roots of Democracy.The most well-known of all of the philosophers is probably Marcus Aurelius, the last of the \u201cgood emperors\u201d and the author of \u201cMeditations.\u201dMarcus Aurelius said,\u201cIf you are distressed by anything external, the pain is not due to the thing itself, but to your estimate of it; and this you have the power to revoke at any moment.\u201dGiven all that we have seen over the past few years (e.g. Cambridge Analytica, etc.), I suspect there is a growing awareness and frustration with the high-sugar diet of Web2.0 that is creating digital addiction and digital diabetes.What most people don\u2019t yet realize is that there\u2019s a healthier alternative.Thirty years ago, there were no vegan products on the shelves in supermarkets. No one was doing yoga in Times Square.Today they do.Those people have made a lifestyle choice for their bodies.Web3.0/blockchain/crypto is the lifestyle choice for their minds.A life full of digital intention.Originally published at http://development.frcoder.net on July 9, 2019.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Marketing", "Decentralized", "Cryptomarket"]}, {"title": "History of Bitcoin & the Web3", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@sherminvoshmgir/history-of-bitcoin-the-web3-8e0307cc1c5d?source=search_post", "author_name": "Shermin Voshmgir", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@sherminvoshmgir", "publish_date": "2019-07-12", "last_modified_date": "2019-07-26", "readtime": "8.67", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "History of Bitcoin & the Web3Shermin VoshmgirFollowJul 12 \u00b7 9 min readThis is a sneak-peak into the book Token Economy, Shermin Voshmgir, 2019The Bitcoin white paper didn\u2019t come out of thin air, and P2P networks are not a new phenomenon. P2P Networks are rooted in the early history of the computer and Internet, building on decades of research of computer networks, cryptography, and game theory.The first computer networks were invented in the 1960s. ARPANET was a private network of American university computers introduced in 1969, initially funded by the Advanced Research Projects Agency of the United States Department of Defense. It turned into a global network in 1973 when it integrated the computers of research institutions in England and Norway. In 1974, it turned commercial with the integration of the first Internet service provider, Telnet. That same year, a paper was published describing a working protocol for sharing resources using packet-switching among the nodes. A central control component of this protocol was the Transmission Control Program (TCP). In 1982, TCP\u2019s monolithic architecture was divided into a modular architecture consisting of a transport layer (TCP) and the Internet layer, also known as \u201cInternet Protocol\u201d (IP). The model became known informally as TCP/IP as the standard networking protocol.Another breakthrough was achieved in 1983 with the introduction of DNS, which made the addressing of nodes within the network more readable. However, in these first-generation computer networks, the main focus was on connecting a public network of computers with each other, and resolving the question of addressing computers, and transmitting data. The network architecture was still based on client-server logic. Furthermore, secure communication was never a mainstream focus in the early days of the Internet. However, select researchers were intrigued by exactly this question.Ralph Merkle\u2019s cryptographic research in the early 1970s laid the foundation of secure communication over P2P networks. His work conceptualized how to resolve \u201csecure communication over insecure channels\u201d like a computer network, and laid the foundation for modern public-key cryptography. In his dissertation, he furthermore described a method of building collision-resistant cryptographic hash functions. He also filed a patent for a special type of hash table called a Merkle tree that allowed more efficient and secure verification of the contents of large data structures.In 1976, Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman built on some of his ideas and created a mechanism for securely exchanging cryptographic keys over a public network. It was one of the earliest implemented examples of public key exchange, and also introduced the concept of digital signatures. Before public key methods were invented, cryptographic keys had to be transmitted in physical form, so secure digital key exchange over public networks was groundbreaking work, without which Bitcoin and subsequent technologies would not work. In 1978, Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman found a way to create a one-way cryptographic function that was hard to invert. Their algorithm \u2014 now known as RSA \u2014 introduced the era of asymmetric cryptography, which then evolved into the use of elliptic curves in cryptography \u2014 suggested independently by Neal Koblitz and Victor S. Miller in 1985, also a key technology in Bitcoin.In the meantime, with the rise of the personal computer and the introduction of the Internet Protocol Suite, TCP/IP, the Internet became more widespread. However, usability was still a problem. You had to navigate the Internet using command lines, aka computer language. Tim Berners-Lee resolved this problem with his vision for the World Wide Web. He introduced a standard for creating visual websites with a relatively simple markup language, and navigating the Web with links, which point to other websites with a simple click. While from a publishing point of view, the WWW allowed everyone to easily be an equal contributor to information available on the Internet, data was still stored and managed behind the walled garden of servers. Neither TCP/IP nor the protocols building on it resolved the question of where to store and how to manage the data. In public computer networks, the structure of the system \u2014 network topology, network latency, number of computers \u2014 is not known in advance. The computer network can, therefore, consist of unknown and untrusted computers and network links. The size and composition of the network can also change at any time during the execution of a distributed program. The ability to provide and maintain an acceptable level of service in the face of faulty processes thus is a key in network resilience. The focus back in the day was on data transmission in a public network, which was already a hard problem to solve.For economic reasons, centralized data storage and management became mainstream. The problem with centralized networks is that the system administrators, or institutions controlling the servers, are the only entities controlling the availability of information being shared. This means that if administrators decides to no longer distribute a file, or manipulate or censor data, they can simply do this on their servers, and the information will no longer be available to users.In 1982, David Chaum introduced the concept of Blind signatures, which guaranteed the privacy of the sender of information. It was built for voting systems and digital cash systems. He introduced the idea of Ecash as an anonymous cryptographic electronic money or electronic cash system, that was commercialized through his company Digicash, which was used as a micropayment system at one US bank from 1995 to 1998. The system was dissolved in 1998, possibly because he was ahead of his time, as e-commerce applications were not that widespread yet.In 1991, Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta introduced a system where document timestamps could not be tampered with, introducing the earliest academic works on a cryptographically secured chain of blocks. Their aim was to certify when a document was created or modified \u201cin a world in which all text, audio, pictures, and video documents are in digital form and in easily modifiable media.\u201d In their initial proposals, they used centralized timestamping services. They then tried to distribute trust by requiring several users \u2014 that were selected through pseudo-random number generators \u2014 to timestamp the hash, instead of a centralized institution. A year later, in 1992, Bayer, Haber, and Stornetta included Merkle trees to the mechanism. This improved the system efficiency by allowing several document certificates to be collected into one block.The first \u201cProof-of-Work\u201d function was introduced by Hashcash in 1997 by Adam Back. The idea was to limit email spam and denial of service attacks, forcing computers to do some computational work. The original idea was proposed by Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor in their 1992 paper, \u201cPricing via Processing or Combatting Junk Mail.\u201d Before the emergence of Bitcoin many years later, the concept introduced by Hashcash was also used as a mining mechanism in b-money in 2004. B-money was an early proposal created by Wei Dai for an \u201canonymous, distributed electronic cash system.\u201d It was proposed in the context of cypherpunks mailing-list discussions relating to possible applications of Hashcash, which was also published on the same mailing list. This cypherpunk mailing list \u2014 initiated by David Hughes \u2014 represented a group of activists advocating the use of strong cryptography and privacy-enhancing technologies in every-day life as a means to social and political change. Many of the above-mentioned individuals contributing to key technologies that were later used in Bitcoin were active cypherpunks.In 1998, Nick Szabo designed a mechanism for a decentralized digital currency he called \u201cBitGold\u201d, which implements many of his ideas around smart contracts and digital agreements. Szabo\u2019s thoughts of self-enforcing agreements were formulated roughly around the same time as the Idea of Ricardian Contracts, introduced by Ian Grigg in 1996 (read more: Part 1 \u2014 Smart Contracts). While BitGold was never implemented, many refer to it as a direct precursor to the Bitcoin architecture. Just like Bitcoin later, BitGold imagined a PoW-based consensus algorithm in which computing power is spent to solve cryptographic puzzles. However, the BitGold proposal could not resolve the problem of double-spending in a fully decentralized way \u2014 sybil attack resistant \u2014 which was probably the reason it was never implemented. Szabo was speculated by many to be Satoshi Nakamoto \u2014 Bitcoin\u2019s anonymous creator \u2014 a rumor he has denied.In 1999, the music-sharing application Napster popularized the modern-day notion of P2P networks. It changed the way data was stored and distributed over the Internet. Napster created a virtual overlay network for file sharing, which was independent of the physical network of the Internet. In this virtual network, all computers involved formed a subset of the computers in the physical network. Data was still exchanged directly over the underlying TCP/IP network, but at the application layer, peers were able to communicate with each other directly. P2P networks increased robustness because they removed the single point of failure that can be inherent in a client-server based system. If one computer on the network fails, the whole network is not compromised or damaged. Such computer networks need to be designed in a way that they tolerate the failures of individual computers, whatever the source of failure. However, Napster relied on the operation of central indexing servers and was thus susceptible to shut down, after copyright infringement claims and a legal battle.A new family of file sharing protocols spearheaded by Gnutella in 2000 eliminated such central points of failure. It allowed users to find each other and connect remotely, searching every node on the network and therefore was more decentralized, and censorship-resistant. While Gnutella resolved the decentralization problem, they did not resolve the privacy problem. Third-generation file-sharing networks like BitTorrent used distributed hash tables to store resource locations throughout the entire network, in a cryptographically secure way. Distributed hash tables not only replaced indexing servers but also guaranteed the anonymity of its network actors and all data being shared over the network. These distributed hash tables are now also used by blockchains and other Web3 protocols like IPFS and Ethereum.Even though modern P2P networks, ever since the emergence of Napster, resolved the problem of efficiently distributing data within a network, they did not resolve decentralized validation or verification of data. Another problem those files sharing networks did not manage to resolve was the \u201cfree-rider problem\u201d: the fact that large numbers of users utilized resources shared by other nodes, but did not share anything themselves. It can cause the community to collapse. Free-riding was a result of the fact that users did not have incentives to cooperate. Cooperation furthermore consumed their own resources while degrading their own performance.In 2004, Hal Finney introduced the first reusable PoW system before the emergence of Bitcoin. He introduced the idea that the value of an RPoW token is guaranteed by the value of the real-world resources required to \u201cmint\u201d a PoW token. Finney also received the first Bitcoin transaction from Bitcoin\u2019s creator \u2014 Satoshi Nakamoto \u2014 in 2009. Finney apparently lived in the same town as a Japanese-American named \u201cDorian Satoshi Nakamoto,\u201d who has often denied having been involved in Bitcoin. This fact added to speculation that he may have been Bitcoin\u2019s creator, which he always denied.In 2008, the Bitcoin white paper was published under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. It was shortly after the peak of the financial crisis and the collapse of major banks like Lehman Brothers. The aim was to provide a system for P2P electronic cash without banks. While the first specifications were implemented by Satoshi, a group of dedicated individuals gradually took over to implement further development of the code, which was finalized and deployed a few months later when the Bitcoin Network went live and the first block was created and the first bitcoin minted. However, it is interesting to note that the white paper did not talk about blockchain, only about a \u201cchain of blocks.\u201d The term \u201cblockchain\u201d became widespread years later when people started to replicate the Bitcoin codebase for developing alternative protocols.While modern P2P networks such as Napster suffered from missing incentivization of network actors, early e-cash ideas were not able to defend against Sybil attacks. The Bitcoin white paper was a game-changer, as it proposed a protocol for collective validation of data. It introduced a consensus mechanism (\u201cProof-of-Work\u201d), which allowed to store a growing transaction record \u2014 the blockchain \u2014 on each node of the network. Bitcoin thereby resolved the free-loader problem of previous P2P networks, by introducing tokenized incentives to motivate all actors to contribute to the system in a truthful manner. Even though Bitcoin was never designed with file sharing in mind, it eventually inspired a new class of P2P storage frameworks, which will be a crucial building block for a decentralized Web. These decentralized storage networks can now use the power of tokenized incentives to build on the legacy of previous file-sharing protocols, and incentivize their network actors with a native token, using a blockchain as a universal state layer. Examples thereof are: \u201cSwarm\u201d, \u201cStorj\u201d, \u201cSIA\u201d,and \u201cIPFS\u201d.About the AuthorShermin Voshmgir is the Author of the Book \u201cToken Economy\u201c.

McKayFollowJul 11 \u00b7 2 min readPhoto by Rodion Kutsaev via Unsplash.It\u2019s no secret that Chrome has been the 800-pound gorilla among web browsers for some time. Its global share of the browser market is currently over 60 percent, according to a recent story by Bloomberg fretting that Chrome\u2019s maker, Google, might be abusing its market power to quash competing browsers.Such complaints against tech\u2019s biggest companies are becoming more common these days across a number of product categories, so we shouldn\u2019t exactly be surprised by any kefluffle over Chrome.That said, I think there may also be a silver lining to the current lop-sided browser market that Bloomberg didn\u2019t mention: The smaller players, in their desperation to draw users\u2019 attention away from Chrome, have gotten pretty aggressive about pushing new features, some of them quite groundbreaking.In particular, several have been adding built-in crypto wallets or privacy protections that are quite un-Googley. (Is that a word? You know what I meant.) I\u2019ve blogged previously about Brave, which is built around Basic Attention Token and aims to re-engineer how creators get compensated for digital content. In the last month or so, I\u2019ve also been experimenting with Opera, which now offers a built-in wallet for Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, and Vivaldi, which has added encrypted syncing of user information across devices.On the crypto front in particular, the approach of Brave and Opera is diametrically the opposite that of Chrome and the \u201clarger\u201d browser players like Safari and Firefox. The little guys are essentially on offense, trying to see what cool blockchain-based stuff they can give to users. By contrast, the bigger players\u2019 crypto-related anouncements have primarily been defensive, focusing on measures to block unscrupulous crypto miners from hijacking users\u2019 browser bandwidth without telling them.That has been a very real problem in the crypto space, don\u2019t get me wrong. But this tends to be true of any new technology \u2014 the real-world usage patterns include both instances of abuse and instances of exciting, user-beneficial innovation.It\u2019s fitting that the likes of Brave, Opera, and Vilvaldi are emphasizing the latter right now as market underdogs. I may do a more detailed review of these browsers later, but for now, I\u2019m just glad they\u2019re out there offering users a different choice \u2014 and very different visions of what the web should be as a whole.It\u2019s way more likely that the web will someday be fixed by one of these scrappy upstarts than a behemoth company that\u2019s benefited mightily from the broken, over-centralized status quo.Thanks for spending some time with Indizr today.

The applications are going to look almost exactly like what you are currently using, but the change will be on the back-end. If you are a betting man you will want to consider Siacoin for Cloud, Steemit as a platform for social media, and even Augur as the way to check out future betting events.Once you start to see the release of the first blockchain item that works right, you will likely see people leaving 2.0 and going to the 3.0. That is because the developers will have technology and user friendly tech of web 2.0, but they will have the start of the 3.0 which is supposed to be even easier.In this segment here we are going to look at different companies and segments of web 2.0 and let you know which of the projects from blockchain are going to chance this and lead the evolution to web 3.0.The payment methods that people are using currently usually go through credit card companies, the bank, or even PayPal. these are going to be the places that are responsible for getting the money and making sure it is moved properly, but also keep any theft from happening in the transaction.With all this type of work the organizations often have a lot of cost. This type of cost and security that is required is what has kept the fees so high for these companies you are going to be using.According to David Sessford of Ready Steady Sell with the emergence of cryptocurrency you will notice that a lot of the security concerns are going to vanish and the cost of doing a transaction will be quite a bit lower. Some of the currencies that are currently being used around the world include Zcash, Monero, Bitcoin, and Litecoin. All that the users have to get is access to the Internet and a device to keep the wallet on. If you are selling products then you just need to get a company like Bitpay to integrate the crypto currency into your payment system.Since this is going to be a smooth transition, though, you will notice that it will happen without even using the crypto currency. This means you will still be able to use the methods that you are used to, rather than trading on the crypto exchanges that have been all over the place recently on the value of the coins.You will find that Stellar Lumens is a company that is dedicated to disrupting the payment methods by connecting all the systems together from the banks, the users, and even the payment systems. This is going to allow for faster transactions around the globe. This does not have to be done in crypto even, but can be done in any type of currency. When you are using Stellar Lumens you will not even realize that you are using a cryptocurrency to get the work done because the transactions are run on the backend of the currency.The Request Network is another one that is seen as a major competitor for PayPal. This is a platform that will let you to make payment request from anyone at any time. When you are making payments here they are done using blockchain, which is going to remove the third party, but still get paid in full securely.What is even better is the guys at Request Network know that people do not want to deal with cryptocurrency yet, and since this is the case they have implemented different programs to make the request easier for people with any currency. Since they are using the blockchain technology, though, the network has a major advantage in the fact that they can do the transactions for a significantly lower fee.Most of the people are going to continue to use social media, but even then we all see it has some serious flaws in the way it works. Some of those include Facebook scandals, the mechanisms that are used to make you see what Instagram or Twitter wants you to see, but also the way the advertising is done is flawed.The main issue that you have to deal with here is how the information you have on these sites can be used against you and easily invade your privacy. For instance you do not want to have your friends going through your browser history, but the social media sites do this by scanning your cookies and then will make a profile based on your history and then sells it.And while the cats are cute we want to use the phone to entertain us and keep us in contact with friends we normally would not hear from. So we cannot bring ourselves to leave social media because of this.Steemit is going to be the solution with its blockchain technology that is leading the way in social media development to web 3.0. This platform is one that has its own model that the creators of the content are curated by a group of peers. When the content gets upvoted by having good quality, it is going to cause a microtransaction of Steem, which is the currency that is used here.This is a platform that does not have ads and does not even store information on users, but does not censor the information that is posted and if you are active you even get rewarded with cryptocurrency. Steemit is the leader with this technology, but you can even find DTube, which is the YouTube alternative based off of blockchain.The downside is Steemit has been so successful it is starting to draw a lot of competition. One competitor you will find is Narrative which is a beautifully designed website. This is one that is going to be similar to Steemit, but the governance is done by the users who create topic niches. Narrative has also decided to have part of its site to brands, which are able to spread themselves out on the platform by getting quality content out in front of people.You can also find Sapaien, which is a news platform; an alternative to LinkedIn called Indorse, and even ONG.Social which is a great program that is social and focuses quite a bit on the privacy of people.Often we are going to find that we are going to find different companies that are a great alternative to our normal entertainment and we often turn to Netflix and YouTube for this. The worst part is these companies have really taken the market control and this does not leave much room for competition. This allows people to create a lot of content, which the companies then collect and sell the data.Often the users are going to publish the content on these platforms and hope they can make it big, but often do not make anything back for what they create. You will also see people have started to question the different censorship that YouTube is doing, how it changed its payment plan, and even how much Spotify pays to the musicians that are posting songs on the network.You will find that a lot of blockchain programs are ready to disrupt this as well. The music industry has really seen a lot of bad deals hurt people and are really looking to take the lead to change this issue. Imogen Heap, a musician, has started her own project based off of blockchain called Mycelia which is meant to give the musicians and the creators of the music a fair price for the music they have made. You will also notice that you have Voise which is a great platform that is decentralized and very easy for the artists to reach their fans.Flixxo is a company that is using Ethereum to try to dethrone YouTube, but you have Dtube as well from Steem. You will also see that another candidate to take down YouTube is Videocoin, which is a startup that managed to gain a lot of traction with a 35 million dollar ICO period.If you are looking for storage solutions you will notice that you have Storage Cloud as a great solution. This is where you will find that you can store files and hardware easily for a cheap cost, but also access these from anywhere in the world.The problem with cloud storage is all the information is going to be stored in a centralized location that people can have access to. This is the single point of problem because no matter how secure the cloud is only one company has it. This could easily lead to a compromise in the one company and when this happens you could easily have all of your data exposed to everyone.Since that is the case, it is time to decentralize storage as well. This is where you will find Siacoin stepping up as the biggest company here. This is a company that allows people who have extra storage to rent it out for payments in the form of cryptocurrency. This is a company that could easily have some serious growth in the future because it is already cheaper than Google or Amazon.You will see another startup as well called Filecoin. This is a company that had a huge ICO and was one of the largest in history making 257 million. This is a company with a decentralized network that keeps the files stored, but at competitive prices. You will find that Storj has also thrown their hat into the ring as well with a great plan that is low on the price, but high in security with only the user getting into the data.The online advertisement model that is currently being used is not working right. Often you can see this just by visiting some of the companies that are advertising on the site like YouTube and Facebook. When you are running a website you know it is a big business and often when you ask people to subscribe you end up losing people rather quickly. Often the best way to make money is letting ads be shown on your site and the more traffic the more income you get from the ads.The downside is most of the time people ignore the ads. When the people are not viewing the ads it is bad enough, but some people even have adblockers that keep the ads from showing up. Even Google, which makes the most money from the ads has an extension on the Chrome browser to block ads.The changes that can happen is not the contribution of people clicking on the ads that are shown, but getting profitable based off of the contributions of the visitors. You will see that several blockchain companies are working on this. One of the biggest that is going on is Basic Attention Token. This is a company that has made the point of connecting the content creators, to the advertisers, and then the consumers without any major company acting in the middle.You will notice that the company even has its own browser called Brave. This browers is one which the users are able to pay small transactions to the creators of the content they liked and the advertisers then pay the consumer for the attention. This is all done without anyone knowing about it.You will also notice that you have Oyster Pearls which is another online advertisement model. This is a company that has an engine in the works that allows content consumers to contribute to the websites they love for the GPU and CPU which helps make the websites less dependent on ads. This is also going to allow the websites and the creators of the content to be stored on a decentralized platform, which is cheaper and even more secure.You will find a large project called Substratum that is being worked on for running the Internet. This platform will allow people to contribute computing resources to a decentralized web, which will not have any type of censor or control in place by an organization.You will find that the users are going to be paid with a crypto currency for helping t keep the Substratum running. You will notice that you can find the hosted content in the regular browser without anything interfering with what people are going to see. Just think what this can do for people who are oppressed by their government.", "responses": 29, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Web Three Point Zeo", "Web 3 Point 0", "Internet", "Internet History"]}, {"title": "Web 3.0", "post_link": "https://medium.com/signal-v-noise/web-3-0-3ab565085a1d?source=search_post", "author_name": "Nathan Kontny", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@natekontny", "publish_date": "2017-03-18", "last_modified_date": "2018-04-05", "readtime": "4.68", "claps": 697, "voters": 632, "content": "Web 3.0Nathan KontnyFollowMar 18, 2017 \u00b7 5 min readWhatever happened to Web 3.0? What was it? Did it ever happen? I\u2019ve seen multiple attempts at definitions. Things about artificial intelligence. The semantic web. Social networks.One thing I remember about Web 2.0 was that 37signals (the original company behind Basecamp) was labeled as a company who was very \u201cWeb 2.0\u201d.I\u2019m not sure that was true.Are those grapes? No, coffee beans. Coffee beans aren\u2019t actually the chocolatey looking things we usually see until they are roasted. And even as recently as 1850, folks were buying those green beans and had to roast and grind them by hand at home.Along came William H. Bovee in 1850 who figured there had to be an opportunity here. He came up with an idea to roast the beans, grind them himself and sell the product in cans to consumers \u2014 making coffee much more convenient.He also hired a carpenter, named James, who took a lot of interest in the coffee business. James eventually became William\u2019s partner and later bought the entire company for himself. Williams company, originally \u201cPioneer Steam Coffee and Spice Mills\u201d was then renamed after James\u2019 own last name: J.A. Folger & Co. What we now call just \u201cFolgers\u201d.William and James ushered in what many coffee historians refer to as the \u201cFirst Wave\u201d of coffee.The First Wave of coffee was mass production. Bringing convenience to consumers. Making sure everyone who wanted coffee could get it. Maybe not the best or freshest quality, but an easy source of caffeine nonetheless.Then came a Second Wave. It started with three friends from college, Jerry Baldwin, Zev Siegl and Gordon Bowker, who opened up a store to sell their own roasted beans and coffee. They scoffed at the idea of selling fancy lattes that were being sold in Italy. But one of their employees couldn\u2019t resist the urge to transform the company to sell the fancier beverages. So that employee, Howard Schultz, bought their small chain called Starbucks and transformed it into the mega-success it is today.Starbucks is the exemplar of the Second Wave. The Second Wave was coffee becoming a first class citizen of retail. You went out to have coffee. It was no longer just something stuck onto breakfast or dessert. The customization options were infinite.The Third Wave of coffee is where we are today. Shops like Intelligentsia and Stumptown realized coffee still had another level of appreciation. Not about: \u201cWhat country was this coffee from?\u201d but: \u201cWhich farmer grew these beans?\u201dEarth\u2019s highest coffee farm at IntelligentsiaIntelligentsia connects the consumer to the minute details and people making your beverage.The Third Wave is about coffee becoming\u2026 artisanal.Once you see these waves with coffee, you start to see these waves everywhere. Beer is now in its third wave with all of the microbreweries. There are reality TV shows about bakery artisans. Everything at the grocery store seems to have gone from: laborious to convenient to mass produced to \u201clocally farmed and sourced.\u201dWas Web 1.0, 2.0 the same thing?Craigslist is the perfect example of Web 1.0. Here were \u201cthings that you used to have to do laboriously by placing ads in newspapers, or hanging up flyers in your neighborhood\u201d now online. It looked (and still looks) terrible. Had plenty of issues and navigation problems. But quality didn\u2019t matter. It was online and you\u2019re never going back. It was ground beans in a can.A key component of Web 2.0 was usability. Convenience wasn\u2019t enough anymore. Things had to work well and be easy to use. It was about the \u201cend user\u2019s experience.\u201d Reminds me of a Starbucks cafe.37signals launched Basecamp back in 2004. Many lobbed them into experts at Web 2.0. Afterall, they spent so much time on design and making sure their products were dead simple to understand and use.But when Basecamp launched I found myself not just interested in the product, but the makers. They opened up their process, their philosophies, even their morning routines and which pens they used.You got to connect with them on a level that seemed unheard of for people making software. And it created an audience around them that loved to use and spread their products.I think 37signals/Basecamp wasn\u2019t another example of Web 2.0, but like Intelligentsia, they ushered in a third wave. Jason, David, and the 37signals crew created artisanal software.What\u2019s funny to me is that even though they were doing this since the early oughts (I just had to find a reason to use the word ought), I feel like few others have understood how powerful this was and utilized it for themselves.Today\u2019s typical company blog is glorified \u201cpress releases\u201d no one gives a shit about (features launched, new hires, self-congrats on raising money or business acquisitions). Or the blog is \u201ccontent marketing\u201d, where hired freelancers spin out countless articles with hopes Google will bless them.Now, don\u2019t get me wrong: company news isn\u2019t a bad thing, SEO and helpful articles on how to use your product isn\u2019t a bad thing. But they pale in comparison to trying to connect as humans with the people who come across your work.And it\u2019s been a huge inspiration in how I run things over here at Highrise. Newsletters I write share something about our life and kind. My welcome email to new customers mention our current weekend plans. And my vlog opens up our process in taking over and rejuvenating Highrise and the crazy life of raising a toddler balanced in. I\u2019ve enjoyed the results: huge open/click rates to things I send, email replies about customers own lives, and support for all the decisions we have to make and figure out.So if you are in a spot where you\u2019re building a business or trying to grow attention to what you\u2019re doing, take a minute to consider\u2026 Are you still trying to mass produce something that\u2019s already been mass produced? Or are you focusing on \u2018user experience\u2019 as your main goal, when no one else disagrees anymore that \u2018user experience\u2019 is important?Or is it time for you to try connecting? Is it time for the Third Wave?P.S. If you enjoyed this article, please help spread it by clicking that \u2764 below.

If you were so bold as to let people know about your web idea, no one would take you seriously. Putting up a \u201cweb page\u201d wasn\u2019t exactly something that anyone, even the creators, expected much to come from and certainly not \u201cmake money\u201d. People were still figuring out how this internet thing was going to work. In fact, even businesses that were well funded with \u201cinternet experts\u201d back then were running into problems getting traction. Money was invested but not much came from it. By the early 2000\u2019s the bubble burst and \u201cI-told-ya-so\u201d was bantered around a lot. To the individual person it was eye-opening\u2026 a lot of people thought \u201check if big business can\u2019t figure this out then how will little \u2018ol me be able to?\u201d.Well, persistent individuals, the Zuckerbergs of FaceBook and Chesky\u2019s of AirBnB did find some traction. This was the early days of web 2.0. Individuals forged ahead with their crazy web ideas when the \u201creal businesses\u201d took a break on the sidelines to lick their wounds from the shellacking from the Web 1.0 debacle. Although the individually run company had great ideas, most we underfunded to really accelerate growth. This is where venture capitalists came in. Hovering over the market they\u2019ve see an idea that had promise but struggling and make a killer deal to invest capital. Most of the successes from WEB 2.0 happened this way.And, for the most part, the way Web 2.0 is structured is the way a majority of people think online business success happens.And it IS\u2026 er, was up until a few years ago.My first encounter with a sales funnel was in 2011 when I needed one for the new membership site I launched for my business. Now, all a sales funnel is is a series of web pages that work together to in a series of thought out steps that automate the selling progress online. When you order from, say, Amazon, you\u2019re interacting with a sales funnel. You search for a product in the funnel, order in the funnel and even order more if you take their suggestions before you checkout. As a consumer you\u2019d never know the painstaking decisions it takes to have you completely unaware of those decisions\u2026 and that\u2019s the point.My company grew 700% in a matter of 3 years directly from my ability to launch and optimize various funnels. And all of this was done by \u201cbootstrapping\u201d my company which means I grew because I reinvested profits back into the company and took no outside money. And this is why the cult-ure of funnel builders is producing more millionaires than any time in American history.People are even doing this with nothing to sell of their own.I\u2019m only doing a marginal job explaining the \u201chow\u201d part\u2026 to learn more you can grab this FREE book that Russell Brunson wrote call DOT COM SECRETS. For my money reading this is more valuable than getting a degree in marketing and it\u2019s free.THE SECRET CULT-URE OF NEW MILLION DOLLAR BUSINESSESIn a private FaceBook group over 160,000 people, normal people like you and me, with little to no experience, gather to share ideas, compare success and help each other get even better results every day. The businesses include a movement coach who teaches a course how to do handstands\u2026 and gets paid $9,000 per client to do that. Another person may run a Shopify store that\u2019s doing tens-of-thousands of dollars in business daily. Another person may only make money without any of his own products or services and has a great lifestyle selling other companies affiliate programs or products.Now, for most this may seem a bit contrary to what they expect to happen with businesses. Up to this point you may have thought \u201cbusiness is cutthroat and a competition against other companies\u201d\u2026 this is where the cult-ure part comes in.I haven\u2019t forgotten how to spell cult-ure if you\u2019re wondering. It\u2019s a funnel thing that reflects the idea that funnel hacking \u201cis a good cult\u201d since everyone is working from the same playbook to do this without the help out outside capital. In fact, it\u2019s a badge of honor in the group to do it WITHOUT outside cash. It\u2019s the new model of the modern entrepreneur.WHY VC CASH OR SHARK TANK IS NOT THE ANSWERFirst, some times making a deal with a VC or a \u201cshark\u201d is a good idea so let\u2019s get this out of the way. However when you know why a bigger company wants to invest in your product, the real reason, you may want to consider growing your company by yourself.For the most part outside money is leveraging what they know against what you don\u2019t and this ends up costing your more equity in your business than you realize. Outside money is usually providing one of two main things\u2026 relationships (aka distribution to the end-user) or capital. But both of these things (you\u2019ll learn) can be solved by yourself and when you develop this skill to find your clients and be able to reinvest your profits back into your company\u2026 you\u2019ll see you don\u2019t need any outside cash.Again for more on the \u201chow\u201d grab your free copy of Dot Com Secrets here now. You\u2019ll be able to read it over a weekend and it will clear up a lot of questions you may already have.THE EMERGENCE OF WEB 3.0Web 1.0 was a lot of people, mostly companies, literally throwing cash at the internet expecting it magically spit out gold bricks. Web 2.0 was the age of the small business owner laboring over developing an idea to 90% completion and then getting cash infusions from outside sharks and giving up large chunks of equity to do this. Web 3.0 is a bit of a rebellion that keeps the real power in the hands of the creators, the ones like you, that nurtured the seed of an idea into the \u201csomething\u201d it is now. It\u2019s people like me and you being aware of the people who came before us, both successes and failures, and learning from them. The benefit from this stage of the internet entrepreneurial landscape is the fact that you CAN have a massively successful business AND retain the equity and profits.Now, it does take patience to be able to be successful with Web 3.0. You will have to be creative. You will have to build, analyze, take two steps back, tear some stuff down THEN get massively successful. But the result of that investment in yourself is that YOU become the shark.In a conference room in a hotel in Orlando just a few months ago roughly a thousand funnel hackers (average people just like you who have online businesses) gathered. During this as part of the conference lead by Russell Brunson was an awards celebration. People were called to the stage, one by one, to receive a \u201c2 Comma\u201d award which signifies their business had one funnel cross the threshold of making $1,000,000 and still growing. DOZENS of people were called up and this wasn\u2019t everyone. Additionally another significant award was given to \u201c8 Figure Club\u201d for those who had grew one funnel past $10,000,000 in revenue. A dozen, or more, people were awarded this.This is REAL money and REAL impact on their lives.Numerous people tell their story and most of them start with\u2026 \u201cI was down to my last $30, got the Dot Com Secrets Book and here I am.\u201d And a lot of them just got started with no experience online prior. One person from the south, selling fabricated metal (how tough is that to market???) is poised to do $30M this YEAR alone. Over 350 people are poised this year alone to join the 2-Comma club.This is Web 3.0. This is freedom.WHO DOES THIS?People wanting to become their own boss.People wanting to create a massively successful side income.People who want to build a side business that actually pays real moneyPeople who do not want to settle for less than they deserve in life.WANT HELP STARTING OR GROWING SOMETHING YOU\u2019VE ALREADY STARTED?Cool.

But when it comes to looking out for the future of your career, even the busiest of developers should understand how important it is to stay current with the newest developer trends. Blockchains have, quite simply, revolutionized many spaces thanks to the implementation of dApps. But can blockchains stay at the forefront of revolutionizing technology if it becomes stagnant? Blockchain primitives will have a huge impact on the ever-changing development of distributed ledger technology, and it will all boil down to one thing: protocols.Protocols: What and WhyWhen it comes to advancing any technology we have to first take a look at the base parts, the primitives if you will. A good place to start is with protocols, since they are fundamental in the technologies we already understand; they will probably become even more integral in technologies of the future. There are two categories for protocols layers, according to Joel Mon\u00e9gro of Union Square Ventures: \u201cfat\u201d and \u201cthin\u201d.Fat layer protocols refer to those that hold the most importance in their respective field. In traditional technology, fat layer protocols are the layer of applications that interface between data and the people. The most obvious examples would be applications like Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, and similar websites. The layer that these applications run on, in traditional tech, is known as the thin layer and consists of HTTP/HTTPS, TCP/IP, and similar protocols.Source: techspot.comIn this setup, the fat layer is dominated by centralized organizations that have access to and own all of the user data, and users are forced to enter their sensitive data into many places over and over. Everytime you buy something from a new website, create a new email account, or sign up for a new service you have to give this data up time and time again. But the blockchain is trying to shift the thickness of these two protocol layers, and in an ideal world we\u2019d have all of our sensitive data in one layer and applications in another.Consolidating everything with DLT primitivesBlockchain technology is celebrated for protecting user data through decentralization, but how exactly does it work behind the scenes? In the blockchain, the fat layer is comprised of various protocols that can be used by a large number of applications, while the applications themselves make up the thin layer. Because of this reversal of where the fat layer is, a blockchain is able to better manage a user\u2019s data since it\u2019s kept in a secure, decentralized place instead of in each and every different application. The dApps in the thin layer can access the data when given the appropriate authorization, but the dApps themselves never control the data exclusively like they do in Web 2.0.Source: usv.comDLT primitives are common in many different chains and act as the underlying building blocks that help everything run more smoothly and efficiently. They exist to make the developing process easier, giving developers chunks of code that is already formed so that they don\u2019t have to write everything from scratch every time.But as intuitive as they are, they are still lacking in certain areas. In the Bitcoin blockchain, for instance, the primitives aren\u2019t nearly as extensive as they could be, which thus limits the usefulness of the chain itself. Bitcoin isn\u2019t built to allow for dApps and other programs to run on top of it, which is why the primitives that exist in its chain are more simple.There are nine DLT primitives that are especially important, and we\u2019ll discuss each in brief detail:Transfer Transactions \u2014 Initiated when an account needs to send or receive data on a blockchain. These are straightforward and consist of verifying signatures, amounts, and recipients of the transaction.Data Transactions \u2014 A transaction that writes data to an account data storage. Each data transaction has a data array that contains data to be written.Issue Transactions \u2014 A transaction that issues token.MassTransfer \u2014 Allows for a transfer transaction to send to multiple recipients.Issue: denotes a specific time and trigger event for a special data instance.Exchange \u2014 Exchanging one cryptocurrency for another without the participation of any third parties.SetScript \u2014 A transaction that attached a specific dApp script or account script to a specified account.NFTs \u2014 Or non-fungible token, is the tokenization of various digital and physical assets into a unique, verifiable form. These tokens, unlike a standard cryptocurrency, are typically not swapped for another in a 1-to-1 trade as each one has a special identifier.Sponsored Transactions \u2014 Allows a transaction to run using funds in escrow to prevent the user from having to pay fees.InvokeScript Transactions \u2014 A transaction that invokes the callable function on a dApp.Other blockchains, such as Ethereum, EOS, and Tron, have plenty of primitives to help programmers remain consistent, but there is a tradeoff for that freedom. In these dApp chains, programmers have dozens of primitives to choose from when programming their dApps, but they don\u2019t have any overlying guidelines that they have to specifically follow.There are standardizations in these chains; for instance, in Ethereum there areERC-20, ERC-223, ERC-721, ERC-777, and more. These standardizations exist to give programmers a choice; they can build their dApps however they want using primitives, but if they want to make their dApps easily integratable with other dApps, chains, and developers\u2019 work then they have to abide by a standard.The different standards have different purposes, but when tokens ride the line between purposes the developers often struggle to find the appropriate choice \u2014 instead of adapting the blockchain to fit their needs, developers are forced to adhere to preset standards if they want their token to be able to easily interact with other tokens.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Blockchain"]}, {"title": "Learn Web 3.0 by actually Deploying an Application on it: Hands-On Approach (IPFS + Ethereum)", "post_link": "https://medium.com/hackernoon/learn-web-3-0-by-actually-deploying-an-application-on-it-hands-on-approach-9141ad88588f?source=search_post", "author_name": "Niharika Singh", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@Niharika3297", "publish_date": "2018-06-03", "last_modified_date": "2019-05-24", "readtime": "5.01", "claps": 1039, "voters": 81, "content": "Learn Web 3.0 by actually Deploying an Application on it: Hands-On Approach (IPFS + Ethereum)Niharika SinghFollowJun 3, 2018 \u00b7 6 min read\u201cDecentralised web\u201d or \u201cWeb 3.0\u201d have become buzz words now because they\u2019ll bring about revolutionary changes in present-day industry. But how many of us actually know about Web 3.0?In this article, I have covered salient features of Web 3.0. After earning the basic understanding of Web 3.0, we will together deploy an application on IPFS. The application has a Solidity smart contract which runs on Ethereum Virtual Machine. The combination of Ethereum + IPFS is what makes the application truly decentralised.Let\u2019s Get Started!Why Web 3.0 Matters to Us?Web 1.0 was the birth of the internet and most of the happenings on the internet were very static. There wasn\u2019t any interactivity. A person remained completely anonymous and privacy remained intact because no critical transaction ever took place. The internet was static as hell! Nothing like what we can even imagine today. Then came in Web 2.0 in 1990s. Web 2.0 gave rise to giants like Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft etc. There came in insane amount of interactivity on the Internet but privacy of a person went for a toss.Nothing is protected and private on the Internet. Nothing.Web 3.0 urges to bring back the privacy of the user by giving user complete control over his/her data. Web 3.0 vouches for democracy rather than monopoly of few giants. Web 3.0 is all about decentralisation rather than centralisation. The shift from Web 2.0 \u2192 Web 3.0 will be gradual. It won\u2019t happen overnight. But, the best way to pace it up is to bring awareness among people. The current business requirements will change when user\u2019s requirements will change. The user needs to realise that they\u2019re the boss of their data! If anybody earns money out of their data, it should be them.If you use the product for free; you are the product.Source: BigChainDBFeatures of Web 3.0\u2192 No central point of control: Companies like Google, Microsoft, Amazon will no longer have control over your data. No governmental body will be able to block websites and restrict services. Blockchains like Ethereum will hale.In short, middlemen would be completely out of the equation.\u2192 Ownership of data: End users will regain complete control of data and have the security of encryption. At present, big companies like Amazon and Facebook have massive data warehouses storing information worth billion dollars to improve their services.\u2192 Dramatic reduction in hacks and data breaches: Because data will be decentralized and distributed, hackers would find a hard time finding a single point of entry into the system.\u2192 Interoperability: Applications will be easy to customize and device-agnostic, capable of running on smartphones, TVs, automobiles, microwaves and smart sensors. At present, applications are OS-specific, and are often limited to a single operating system. For instance, many Android cryptocurrency wallets are unavailable on iOs, causing frustration for consumers who use multiple devices. It adds expenses for developers tasked with issuing multiple iterations and updates of their software.\u2192 Permissionless blockchains: Wealth and other digital assets can be transferred cross-border, quickly and efficiently, anywhere in the world.\u2192 Uninterrupted service: Account suspension and distributed denial of service are dramatically reduced. Because there\u2019s no single point of failure, service disruption will be minimal. Data will be stored on distributed nodes to ensure redundancy and multiple backups will prevent server failure or seizure.Check out the awesome Internet of Blockchain Foundation for more!Time for some hands-on learning!For sake of saving time and length of the article, I\u2019ve already prepared the basic code.

Vastly improved security, integrated payment systems, user control of data, and increased cyber defense from decentralized applications will create a more robust, secure, and inclusive system. It\u2019s estimated that Web 1.0 and 2.0 added $4 Trillion to global GDP and created more than 25 million jobs in the U.S. alone. Web 3.0 is expected to add another $4 Trillion to global GDP and create millions more jobs.However, who will benefit from Web 3.0 is still very much up in the air. The U.S. has been the big winner of the web as we know it so far. Web 1.0 and 2.0 were built on U.S. terms and reflected U.S. values. For example: free exchange of information, open markets, etc. As a result, the U.S. got the jump on its competitors. The biggest internet companies are located in the U.S, and the greatest share of global internet value has been harvested by the U.S. However, this may not be true for the Web 3.0.The key technology for Web 3.0 is blockchain. Blockchain is a decentralized infrastructure design for the internet that allows multiple improvements in the way the web operates. Blockchain allows for low-cost, highly secure eCommerce, secure data sharing between connected devices in the Internet of things (IoT), decentralized data management in which users control data rather than big companies, and super secure data management and communication. Blockchain can be bring huge benefits to the U.S. economy and national security.Blockchain can Protect American Intellectual Property (IP)According to the Global Intellectual Property Center of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, sales from IP-intensive firms totaled $6.9 trillion in 2013. IP-intensive industries are also responsible for 56 million jobs in the United States \u2014 roughly 35% of the U.S. labor force. Moreover, a job with an IP-intensive company pays on average 26% more than a job with a non-IP-intensive company. The Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property (IP Commission) estimates that that the cost to the U.S. economy from counterfeit goods, pirated software, and the theft of trade secrets from these industries could be as high as $600 billion annually with the U.S. suffering over $1.2 trillion in economic damage.Blockchain can put a stop to this drain. By creating a system where digital and physical property can tracked and ensuring that creators of IP are compensated, Blockchain can create a self-enforcing IP control regime that will make it very hard for foreign firms to steal American-produced IP protecting America IP and protecting millions of jobs.Making American Industry More Competitive and Putting American Workers on an Equal FootingBlockchain will permit low-cost, frictionless commerce that will dramatically reduce the cost of doing business, encourage new business growth, and slash the cost of transferring asset and eliminate unnecessary middlemen. In 2010, approximately 34 percent of U.S. GDP was generated by middlemen (e.g., brokers, dealers, agents). Blockchain \u201csmart contract\u201d would allow the automation of many of these unnecessary functions reducing overhead, marking U.S. firms more competitive, and creating millions of more jobs.In addition, blockchain creates transparent, accountable supply chains that can be automatically audited to ensure that firms comply with international labor, safety, and environmental laws. By ensuring that foreign firms are not able to evade these rules, blockchain technology can ensure that they will be unable to illegally undercut American firms. As a result, American workers would be able to compete with foreign workers on an even playing field without cutting wages or engaging in a \u201crace-to-the-bottom\u201d on workers\u2019 rights and environmental protections.Blockchain can Help Maintain America\u2019s Defense and National Security LeadershipAs digital technologies have transformed warfare, the U.S. military has become critically dependent on secure, timely, and accurate data. Blockchain can provide a key role in protecting our core defense data assets. Via its ability to provide secure, trackable, accountable data environments and automated smart contracts, blockchain promises to provide a new paradigm for decentralized management of U.S. defense and national security data assets.An example: blockchain can secure operations orders and planning documents, streamline and secure procurement and supply chains, protect the internet of military or battlefield things (IoMT or IoBT), and provide secure control of autonomous or swarm control. As cyber warfare becomes a key element in the battle space, so protecting digitally enabled assets will become more important. Blockchain\u2019s inherent decentralization and built-in security means that it can provide the insurance to protect these assets and defense against enemy cyber threats.There has been some initial experimentation in these areas. For example, in 2016 the NATO Communications and Information Agency is began evaluating proposals in areas of application of Blockchain technology relating to military logistics, procurement and finance, Internet of Things, and other applications of interest to the military.Similarly, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) had raised a critical need for a secure messaging and transaction platform accessible via a web browser or standalone native application. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has initiated some small research projects to \u201cCreate a secure messaging and transaction platform that separates the message creation, from the transfer (transport) and reception of the message using a decentralized messaging backbone to allow anyone anywhere the ability to send a secure message or conduct other transactions across multiple channels traceable in a decentralized ledger.\u201dIn addition, the U.S. Air Force (USAF) will use SIMBA Chain, a blockchain platform to shore up its logistics and supply chain capabilities. SIMBA Chain is a cloud-based Blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) platform. This government contract will enable the USAF to explore how blockchain technology might improve its logistics and supply chain capabilities.Protecting American Assets Against Cyber AttacksThe current highly centralized paradigm for almost all major infrastructure and digital assets means that the U.S. is highly vulnerable to cyber-attack. From the power grid to Wall Street, the U.S. decentralized digital application built on the inherently insecure platform that is Web 1.0 and 2.0 means that the U.S. is susceptible to cyber-attack. This will only become a more as more and more devices become connected via the Internet of Things (IoT). Blockchain provides a mechanism to protect against cyber-attack. By decentralized assets and control and providing native strong encryption, blockchain technology provides a method to secure assets and protect our nation\u2019s infrastructure.In fact, the U.S. Congress was sufficiently concerned to mandate that Section 1646 of the 2018 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) require that blockchain be assessed for military employment. Specifically, the Secretary of Defense and other federal agencies will be required to brief Congress \u201con the cyber applications of blockchain technology\u2026[and] potential offensive and defensive cyber applications\u201d by May of 2018. The NDAA language also requires an assessment of how adversaries and criminals are using blockchain and legal ways in which the U.S. government could integrate blockchain into dealing with these threats and protecting government networks and critical infrastructure.Web 3.0 Challenges to the U.S.Both Europe and Asia see the benefit of Web 3.0 and are investing heavily in the development of new Web 3.0 technologies. States and businesses in these regions realize that they lost the first two generations of the web, and are determined not to lose the next. Europe in many ways has led the development of blockchain adoption. The notable open source culture that permeates the continent lends itself well to the new dynamic of blockchain, and both private and public entities are actively involved in blockchain projects.In terms of blockchain hubs, the main concentrations of startups are in London, Amsterdam, Barcelona, Berlin, and Switzerland\u2019s Crypto Valley. Estonia\u2019s Guardtime is not only working with its own government to use blockchain for health records but has also contracted with organizations such as NATO. Plus, America\u2019s Nasdaq has reached out to the tiny country in the Baltics to develop applications.United Kingdom\u2019s chief scientist, Sir Mark Walport, unleashed a report in January 2017 outlining the potential of blockchain and showing how it can transform the delivery of public services and boost productivity in government. Soon after, GovCoin Systems Limited, a London-headquartered financial technology company, announced blockchain trials to support government aims in streamlining the distribution of welfare benefits while the Bank of England stated they are looking into the policy and technical issues posed by Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC) and developing blockchain proof-of-concepts.China is even more active. China has issued the most Web 3.0 patents, while many of the biggest and most innovative Web 3.0 firms are located outside there, and the government is already rolling out coordinated development programs aimed at putting their country in the forefront of Web 3.0 development. China realizes the benefit of Web 3.0, and has been investing heavily in Web 3.0 technologies.In March 2018 at the meeting of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Chinese Academy of Engineering, President Xi Jinping state that: \u201cEver since the start of the 21st century, a new generation of industrial revolution is substantially reshaping the global economic structure \u2026 with artificial intelligence, internet of things and blockchain constantly making application breakthroughs.\u201dThis is only one piece of evidence that China is taking blockchain seriously. For example:China\u2019s State Council has endorsed blockchain technology as part China\u2019s 13th Five-year Economic Development Plan (2016\u20132020) and the Ministry of Information and Technology is aggressively supporting the development of blockchain technologyChinese defense journals have discussed the use of blockchain to secure digital assets, protect military supply chains, support espionage, and engage in \u201cGray Zone\u201d warThe Chinese Communist Party website released a primer on blockchain technology that included discussion points on its key features, use cases, and challengesChina\u2019s central bank, the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBoC), is supporting the development of a blockchain-based trade finance platform that will streamline interbank payments and help SMBs get access to a wider range of financing toolsChina\u2019s Supreme People\u2019s Court released new rules stating that blockchain technology is an approved method for storing and authenticating digital evidenceThe Bank of China, not to be confused with the PBoC, revealed plans to aggressively invest in the development of fintech and blockchain technologyChina is the largest holder of blockchain patents in the world with the People\u2019s Bank of China submitting 41 patent applications in the last 12 months alone.China\u2019s State TV has said China expects blockchain to be 10x more valuable than the internet.The China Center for Information Industry Development (CCID) officially publishes their ranking of crypto and blockchain projects consisting of the top 33 projects in their view.In September of 2018 China\u2019s Supreme Court has ruled that evidence authenticated with blockchain technology is binding in legal dispute.A survey by Deloitte revealed that the U.S. is falling behind the U.S. in terms of blockchain deployment. Of a thousand \u201cblockchain-savvy\u201d executives surveyed globally, more than 90 percent of Chinese executives said they had or planned to have blockchain solutions in production this year, whereas only 34 percent of American executives reported similar plans. The same survey reported that 98 percent of Chinese executives were hiring blockchain staff compared to 45 percent in the U.S.Via Deloitte\u2019s 2018 Global Report on BlockchainSimilarly, there has been substantial interest within the Chinese military. An article in the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) journal the China Military Network Defense Department Network on February 2, 2018 argued that China\u2019s defense and security agencies should leverage blockchain to manage the distribution of funds for intelligence operations, protect personnel and weapons life-cycle data from cyber-attacks, and make logistics operations safer.Furthermore, the article stressed that blockchain would alleviate three major dilemmas faced by Chinese government existing paper and electronic records in China: (1) centrally located files that usually lack back-up mechanisms; (2) safe and easy transfer of archival files; and (3) the lack of archival supervision. Moreover, as military logistics becomes smarter, blockchain can improve the enterprise logistics by making it more robust, dynamic, and resilient by creating interconnected device networks. As a result, this new enterprise is less risky and more survivable since it avoids a \u201ccentralized management strategy\u201d that is over-reliant on a few critical information centers or other key geographical sites without giving up government.This theme was taken up in multiple media outlets across China, such as Xinhua and other PLA-friendly sites. Further, this past February, one Chinese website opined that blockchain could even be used in media operations to control both content and contributors in shaping public opinion. In this way, blockchain would be used to secure sources of public opinion, ostensibly to the detriment of any adversarial counter-information operations. More broadly speaking, public opinion warfare is one of three pillars key of China\u2019s Three Warfare strategy (the other two being legal warfare and psychological warfare).Via Deloitte\u2019s 2018 Global Report on BlockchainIt is not unreasonable to hypothesize that a Chinese dominated and designed Web 3.0 would use blockchain as method to create a decentralized, hyper-secure system for state control that could forever exclude Western parties from some operations and give Chinese security organization access to all manner of data. For example, China\u2019s \u201cOne-Belt-One-Road\u201d (OBOR) initiative will link 69 countries, connecting 40 percent of global GDP into a single trading system. A Chinese led Web 3.0 blockchain system will allow frictionless commerce to move through this system with a single coordinated asset tracking system under the control of China.Chinese \u201cSmart Contracts\u201d (complex business rules that specify how an asset it transferred and managed) could include hidden backdoors that gives the Chinese government data on all manner of transfers and forever protect the information it extracts behind an impenetrable, decentralized blockchain wall. Furthermore, Chinese manufactured IoT devices managed on an Chinese designed blockchain could contact hidden smart contracts that could be directed to conduct malign activities against American interests in the case of hostilities or spy or steal American data and hide the source of the cyber-attack behind blockchain secured cyber-walls.A Chinese Web 3.0 would not therefore not be open and transparent vision expressed by U.S., but would be an authoritarian system controlled by the Chinese government. Such a blockchain would allow China to set the terms for Web 3.0 and control digital communications, asset transfer, and global supply chains that pass through the Belt-and-Road system \u2014 potentially seriously impacting U.S. interests.What Does the U.S. Government Need to Do?Unless the U.S. government acts now, we risk losing the race for Web 3.0 and having to develop within an imposed Web 3.0 system in which numerous bad actors might be able to exploit the U.S.\u2019s growing dependence on digital data.So, what can the U.S. do to catch up in the race towards Web 3.0? We recommend three steps:Develop Comprehensive, Coordinated Web 3.0 Policy: This policy would support the development of the blockchain industry, support R&D, and provide funding and executive and legislative direction to Federal agencies to explore the use of blockchain for civilian, military, and national security initiatives.Create a Supportive Regulatory Environment: The regulatory system in the U.S. currently discourage the development of blockchain in several sectors (e.g., finance, healthcare). The U.S. needs to encourage Federal regulatory agencies to reduce regulatory ambiguity, support the development of blockchain, and develop standardsCreate Incentives for Blockchain \u201cMiners\u201d to Locate in the U.S.: Blockchain \u201cminers\u201d are essential for verifying blockchain transactions. Currently most of the nodes our of which these miners\u2019 operation are in China and Europe. The U.S. needs to provide tax incentives to bring transaction validation back to the U.S. and ensure that the U.S. dominates the process by which blockchain operations are verified.Taken together, these steps represent a firm basis for the U.S. to begin becoming a key participant in the emergence of Web 3.0. If action is taken now, governmental and business interests in the U.S. can be assured that they will play a key role in the design of Web 3.0 and that U.S. and Western interests and values are clearly considered as the future of the web develops.Disclaimer: The views expressed by the author above do not necessarily represent the views of Consensys AG.

The app employed a clever page-turning mechanism that provided both delight and readability and allowed users to follow specific publications or build their own publications by importing their Twitter and Facebook streams.Flipboard expanded its focus, reach and ability to monetize its product in early 2013 with Flipboard 2.0 which allowed users to specifically create their own magazines by adding a \u201c+\u201d to certain articles and importing photos. Flipboard partnered with publishers to create glossy (or, the Web equivalent of glossy) magazines where Flipboard and the publication could share advertising revenue.Flipboard laid the groundwork for its next iteration earlier this year when its technologically powerful (if lightly used) competitor Zite. The Zite news reader provided the epitome of serendipity in news reading with a backend that recognized what users liked to read among a variety of topics and surfaced interesting and relevant articles from around the Web. Zite was essentially a powerful recommendation engine, like a Pandora for news.The New Zite Backend Of FlipboardAs a company and a product, Zite was based off a search engine called Worio (Web of Research, Iteration One). Worio was essentially a recommendation engine tied to the social graph. When the search engine sputtered out as a business, Worio pivoted to Zite and embraced the coming of the iPad. When CNN bought Zite in August 2011, it was essentially the Worio recommendation engine that it wanted to implement on its websites to recommend articles tied to user interest.\u201cI think that the Zite technology can be really valuable to the Flipboard audience. Flipboard has a massive audience,\u201d said Zite CEO Mark Johnson in an interview with me when Zite was acquired by Flipboard. \u201cThe problem with Zite \u2026 my bosses have always said this, I have always said this, Zite is just not in the hands of enough people. Once people get their hands on Zite they say, wow, I just can\u2019t live without this. Our retention rates are amazing, our engagement is amazing. We never really achieved the breakout success that Flipboard had.\u201dYesterday, Flipboard announced the third generation of its app and platform. Flipboard now has over 30,000 topics to follow and the app will tailor content to users interests when they follow a topic or a person. In addition, Flipboard is rolling out its own curated magazine called \u201c The Daily Edition\u201d that is built both algorithmically and from Flipboard\u2019s editors that will be available to users at 7:00 a.m. local time every day.With Zite now in tow, Flipboard is ready to be the leader in the next generation of magazines. And in doing so, it is the epitome of Web 3.0.The Essence Of Web 3.0First, let\u2019s not get tied to labels. The current era of has been called the Mobile Revolution, the Mobile Era, Web 3.0 etc. Whatever you want to call it, the Internet has fundamentally changed since the launch of the original iPhone in 2007 and the Apple App Store in 2008.For the sake of simplicity, let\u2019s call it Web 3.0. To make the perfect Web 3.0 app \u2014 as Flipboard has been doing \u2014 a company needs to successfully integrate at least five distinct properties:It is mobile first, based on apps and available on iOS, Android and through a browser.It integrates social media and the wisdom of the crowd.It provides a platform for others to build upon.It takes advantage of the cloud for computing, storage and sharing purposes.It has an element of algorithmic automation or self-service that tailors the experience to the specific user.Only a few companies can claim to hit all of these properties on the head. Flipboard is one, music service Spotify is another. Waze, Uber, Instagram, Hotels Tonight, Evernote are all good examples of flourishing Web 3.0 apps.Flipboard is native to Web 3.0. It launched as a mobile app specifically for the iPad before reaching out to the other mobile operating systems and the Web. It has social and sharing baked into its core from the beginning, allowing users to create their own feeds and now their own personal magazines. The \u201cMagMakers\u201d feature has 10 million personal magazines and Flipboard has a growing robust publisher platform.Now with the Zite integration, Flipboard is much stronger in cloud and automation, creating a unique experience for every one of its users. The effect is one of the most advanced apps \u2014 in any category \u2014 in either Google Play or the App Store.Flipboard & The Future Of MagazinesDepending on whom you ask, the future of publishing is either completely borked or approaching its golden age. The answer usually depends on the stakeholder as old media that have seen their businesses erode will complain while new media that has embraced all the aspects of Web 3.0 rejoice.Flipboard is the model of the next generation. It takes advantage of the fact that the Web now produces more information everyday than had been created through most of human history before 1999. Flipboard then packages that information to inform and delight users wherever they are, on whatever device they are using. For all its background complexity, Flipboard\u2019s product is egalitarian, elegant and simple.Lead image: Flipboard CEO Mike McCue speaking at a ReadWrite Mix event by Ken Yeung, Flickr Creative Commons.

These things take time but that shouldn\u2019t stop us sprinting towards that future as fast as we can, or trying to lead others there with us.At Nexves we are imagining the future and building the products and services we need to get there. We believe humanity should begin climbing the ladder now to receive the benefit of technology that currently exists as well as those that are coming. We need \u201cmoney\u201d to survive \u2014 but we must seek innovative products, services and platforms that allow us to save as much as possible, expanding our wealth instead of allowing it to remain dormant. The internet has enabled access to excess capacity on an unprecedented scale \u2014 just look at Uber and Airbnb, and we believe this model is equally as applicable to money.We need to make our money work for usWhat Money Actually IsWe all believe that money means somethingmedium.comThe reason for this is clear. Banks have exploited us for too long, they have gambled with our money and cost us a fortune. The reward for warehousing our capital in these institutions is derisory. Interest rates on our savings are borderline offensive but little has changed in 100's of years. Banks still make unimaginable profits by putting our money to work for them. Why shouldn\u2019t we benefit equally, or more so, than those using our money to get rich?At the same time, money isn\u2019t worth the paper it is printed on. You\u2018d think that because a currency is tied to a Country it means something. The reality is that money hasn\u2019t been anything but a collective belief in the myth of value for nearly 100 years. The day the Dollar was divorced from the value of gold, no currency in the world was underpinned by a commodity or asset.$19million was recently transferred internationally for a fee of $0.40 cent. Banks are terrified. For centuries they have monopolised the transfer of wealth, taking a cut of every exchange with no possible way to avoid it. Even using the most efficient transfer service of today would cost over $100,000.00 in Traditional Money.At the same time, you are unable to participate in asset classes reserved for the Richest 1%. The reason for this is that \u2018Sophistication\u2019 rules determine who can invest in what. We don\u2019t think this is fair, and as long as there is a diversified portfolio of assets why shouldn\u2019t everyone be able to enrich themselves more efficiently? That\u2019s what we are building at NexvesMoney wants to be digital and free, the problem is being tied to 70's technology means it\u2019s impossible to achieve this with traditional money.Relying on central Banks policy leaves us at the whims of government who can devalue our money whenever they want (quantitative easing). They already have during the 2008 Financial collapse.Inflation contributes to this problem. Money becomes worth less year by year, it\u2019s the reason the price of the Freddo has risen so enormously. This doesn\u2019t affect governments, it is a mechanism used to enrich them.Money wants to be free, why should I give up anything when I simply want to transfer you money? Just because something has been a certain way for a long time doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the right way to do things now.We now have the technology to change our path to the futureWhether we choose to take it is up to us. The future is invented by those who have the boldest vision of what it can become and who relentless persevere in pursuit of its realisation. This is the future we are trying to realise at Nexves.To realise it we need you to see it and help us shape it \u2014 Join usSteps to realising this futureTo begin doing so we must reinvent what money is and our expectation of what an account should offer. We must create a central focal point, which enables innumerable spokes of services to extend from it. The limiting factor of what can be achieved by this should be the depth to which we can imagine a better future. The central hub becomes the key to enabling trust on the internet on an unprecedented scale, without the need to divulge identities. The ability to conceal your identity online is critical to enabling certain actions, but it should not provide a cloak for impunity.The easiest ramp to participation is an account which resembles the one you currently use as closely as possible. This removes any perceived barriers while endowing you with the technology necessary to begin participating in this new world. Where you place your money in the account, it remains yours forever, with no risk of loss. What this acts as is the mechanism to create a new currency. Proof-of-savings acts as a form of \u2018mining\u2019 to endow you with something which becomes a tangible asset. Your actions can be measured and used to earn additional tokens. For this to be appealing there must be an incentive or collective belief that the tokens you receive will be worth something in the future, or that there will be a market for exchange. Simultaneously, that belief isn\u2019t 100% necessary. If you hold the tokens you will receive payment on them each time there is a liquidity even.Stage 1 \u2014 Asset-Backed Digital-CurrencyCryptocurrency/Tokens are the future of money for a number of reasons, but most pertinently they enable the exchange to be incredibly efficient\u2014 both in terms of speed and cost but our initial problem still runs true. If people aren\u2019t ready to participate in this field, how can we help them do so with the lowest barrier to entry? We can get them there by providing benefits which exceed what they currently have by several orders of magnitude.Achieve this through services to which they are already familiarThat means a money management platform which they already understand. By replicating the features on an existing account \u2014 iterating on them and improving the user experience significantly, we can create a compelling offering which doesn\u2019t alter behaviour or require changes. By doing this, the barrier to entry becomes zero. Everyone needs an account to manage their money, Nexves becomes a far better version of this.The first stage to reaching this future is a central money management account. This means a platform where you can deposit your existing money. You forego the interest and cashback fees you would typically accrue on spending/savings from your account and instead you are rewarded with the digital currency detailed above. Immediately this will be worth the equivalent amount you should have received in interest \u2014 i.e 1 token = \u00a315 (1 token paid for every \u00a31,000 stored on the platform for 30 days, 1.5% interest = \u00a315 hence initial token value).For those willing to speculate that the value of the token will rise, all they have to do is hold the tokens in expectation of future value. Naturally, the token will rise in value as the currency is deprecatory instead of inflationary. This rewards early users as they will receive more tokens per \u00a31,000 saved than those who adopt later.The money accrued from interest will be used to seed an investment fund which invests in asset classes reserved for the Richest 1%. That means commercial/international real estate, private equity and startup investments, among other things. We are already forming partnerships with the leading figures in each of these industries to operate alongside.In order to proceed with this plan most efficiently, we are proposing a Token sales alongside the Proof-of-savings mechanism which will be how all future tokens are created. The initial sale will involve around 2,500,000 tokens at a sale price of \u00a315 per token. The majority of this money will be invested immediately in the asset classes above with the rest reserved for the innovations listed below.Stage 2 \u2014Data Analysis to Enable SavingsThe first product we will create will harness the power of data each of the users on the platform provides. Right now there is no way for you to know you are getting the best deal on any product or service you use, out with asking family and friends. We will leverage the intelligence we are able to accrue, match that with tokenisation and acquire unimaginable quantities of actionable data providing revolutionary transparency to consumers. Right now banks know how much I pay for a specific service and how much you pay for the same thing. What they don\u2019t know is if that is a fair comparison based on the different packages each of us might have.What we can do at Nexves is fill that knowledge void by acquiring the data needed to make the comparison. Through token payments, we can pay you and everyone else on the platform to provide it, where your reward is higher ownership of the investment fund. This means for every recurring monthly expense you have, we can tell you how much you should save based on what other people on the platform are paying. Eventually, we will create a service that does this automatically on your behalf, saving you a lot.Stage 3 \u2014 Earning PlatformThe next thing that Nexves will enable is a platform to earn. This will take advantage of human nature, which calls each of us to act rationally in mutual self-interest. The massive innovation here is that by acting selfishly the whole platform benefits and profits.You are paid to do certain things which grow the investments in the fundThis grows the value of the tokens you have yourselfAt the same time growing the tokens that everyone else hasImagine the power of 10,000 people going to their local supermarket to request they begin stocking a product that we are invested in. Consider the influence of 100,000 people sharing a message about an international destination we own on their social media accounts. Now imagine that influence when it is spread across millions of people doing the same thing. That is the power of platform scale that you can become a part of.My goal is to build something bigger than any of us can alone. That means for Nexves to succeed we need the collaboration of everyone using the platform. We believe we can harness that power while influencing and developing the world to become one we want to live in. By encouraging every individual to act selfishly, we can achieve the best result for everyone. That means you get paid to help grow everyone else's investments, including your own.Ultimately, what we are seeking to become is the largest super-aggregator in history. Collective bargaining on an unprecedented scale.Stage 4 \u2014 Establish a Token EconomyThe liquidity attained from higher frequency of transactions will be critical to establishing Nexves as a viable digital currency. To achieve this there has to be a market economy for which people can transact upon. This means building out the system which enables people without tokens to acquire them. They have the means to participate above by earning them, which is a way to provide the unbanked with access, while also creating an opportunity to acquire future participants at a far younger age than is currently possible.A digital currency means building out an entire ecosystem for consumer purchasing. This means making investments in things which can be purchased or used. A simplest example of this is International real estate. The value of the property would remain an asset for the value of the currency, while rental could be paid in tokens. The innovative aspect of this would be what happens to the spent tokens. Where you purchased your stay entirely in tokens, 90% of them would be burned and10% would be kept for expenses resulting from your stay. Transacting in tokens would mean you received a lower price than is possible in traditional money, while your remaining coins become more valuable because the ones you paid in are destroyed.Wider adoption would enable the currency to be utilised for purchasing in almost any domain. The more users that utilise the platform, the larger potential market for peer-to-peer transactions. Decentralisation becomes the platforms superpower as other Nexves users open the doors to their other products and services on the platform. Through the universal mechanism of trust, your account, bad behaviour can be punished, controlled or prevented.Stage 5 \u2014 Erosion of Marketing as a form of RevenueMy boldest contrarian belief is that advertising as a form of revenue on the internet will be extinct in the next decade. The rise of a decentralised internet where everyone owns everything but nothing simultaneously is inevitable. This will enable us to reclaim the data we are currently providing companies for free, preventing the targeted invasive advertising we are victimised by and stalked across the web relentlessly by.If you\u2019re not paying for the product you are the product, will evolve to become you being the product that pays with a currency you control \u2014 attentionThis is in recognition that we should control our own destiny \u2014 why should multi-national conglomerates commoditise our attention by turning us into zombies whose only contribution to society is the accrual of capital to drive purchasing?Digital taxationIn the same way Napster was a precursor to Spotify, what is the next route to revenue for products/services online? A digital taxation will be achieved by using your CPU/GPU to mine a currency which is distributed to creators as per the volume of attention you provide their product, service or content.Nexves will allow the consumption of content/products /services without the necessity for users to pay creators or service providers directly. For low CPU usage tasks \u2014 watching video, reading articles, social networks, photo sharing, almost every task you undertake online \u2014 these services will tax you a % of your CPU usage and use that to mine Crypto which will be distributed to the creator according to how long you spent watching, reading or using what they made.The FutureImagine the replacement of the internets largest institutions with \u2018free\u2019 alternatives, that includes Facebook, Netflix, Google and every other \u00a3Billion multi-national conglomerate you can imagine. These services won\u2019t be paid for by exploiting the data you provide and advertising to you, instead their revenue will come directly from you, and your contribution to the upkeep of the worlds most sophisticated and widest distributed blockchain. A digital currency will emerge which grows directly from attention. Attention will evolve to become the cash of the internet because eventually, it will become the only thing that matters. There will be a direct correlation between engagement and payment for online services.Your Nexves accounts becomes the central hub from which this will emerge.Stage 6 \u2014 Universal Trust MechanismA universal mechanism for trust is critical to enable the third wave of the internet.Web 1.0 gave rise to internetWeb 2.0 gave rise to the giants who dominate itWeb 3.0 will give rise to distributed networks that take it backAirbnb has its review system, Uber has it\u2019s stars, but there is nothing which straddles the breadth of the internet to provide a holistic snapshot of why people should trust you. Your money management account becomes a passport for the web, where you have full control over the information available about you on it. This will enable you to monetise your data and set controls on when it is appropriate to reveal which information. This mechanism can ensure trust in an environment where without it, it is impossible to do anything.This allows each person to sell their own attention. This, in many ways, is the only commodity in the world which is still scarce. Being advertised at becomes a conscious decision of which you are the beneficiary. Furthermore, there are effective controls which mean it is beneficial for companies to participate in this new system. Instead of paying to advertise on specific words or phrases, if you\u2019re money management account was used as a constraint for which companies could search for leads within, they would be able to target adverts directly to the source without the need to pay an intermediary. The most powerful aspect of this is that you are the person who decides whether you want to give these companies access to your customer profile, or not.Stage 7\u2014 Platform Service LayerThe ultimate vision for Nexves is to become the critical piece of infrastructure for the realisation of a more decentralised world. It becomes the backbone of your digital identity, a route to monetising your actions online, and a way to accrue wealth by enabling savings on an unprecedented scale while putting your money to work. Proof-of-savings becomes the mechanism to enable the emergence of an asset-backed digital currency, where your tokens provide tangible ownership in real assets. That is revolutionary.On top of it, a whole world of possibilities emerge. My annoyance with the way the internet has evolved doesn\u2019t stem from the monopolisation of our attention, it increases with the exploitation of a world without permission. In order to take back control, we must insert mechanism which enables us to protect our data. This doesn\u2019t mean hiding it, or cutting down the content which we release about ourselves, it means being more sensible with the ways we share information online and have switches which we can turn off when we want to detach. In a world where we have been manipulated to vote in certain ways, through the consumption of news and propaganda that often proves to be false, this isn\u2019t just smart it is critical for ensuring that we maintain control of our own sensibilities.Ultimately, we want others to interact with our platform. That means creating distributed services and products which integrate within our own. Your current account is a dumb account. Once you put your money to work in a way which exploits the available technology of the day, while marrying it with the influence of platform scale, we can establish a digital currency which enables us to realise a vision for the internet which is fairer for all.Begin Funding your Future today.

For almost 3 years now, the team has been working on building the Golem Network. Through that time we\u2019ve not only been working on our roadmap milestones, but a substantial amount of our research has been directed towards allowing the implementation of blockchain technologies in multiple industries. Specifically, the latter focus was set in motion after Brass was launched from Testnet into the Ethereum Mainnet. While Golem remains our focus, in parallel, we are looking for other use cases for Golem and work for the betterment of the Decentralized ecosystem as a whole.We are almost ready to introduce the WASM and RASPA use cases and are strongly involved in developing Graphene for Intel Software Guard Extensions (Intel SGX) \u2014 a software that can significantly increase the security and privacy in the Golem network and in the Blockchain industry as a whole. We also constantly look for partners and other projects that could benefit from using the Golem network as a computing platform or to leverage their computing resources.Golem and Hoard strengthen tiesLuckily, our team has found a perfect \u201cpartner in crime\u201d in the room right around the corner \u2014 our friends from Hoard \u2014 that work under the same roof as us. To build this collaboration we started with meetings, discussions, brainstorming. It was a process. Hoard is an expert in the gamedev field, knowing its advantages, tricks, caveats, and the latest cutting edge tools for the industry. On the other hand, the Golem team as a whole has gathered a top notch roster of experts on diverse fields of computing science, security, distributed systems and new programming languages, to name a few.A significant part of the time spent together was devoted to analyzing the difficulties and obstacles, that game developers encounter in everyday functioning along with their frustrations.\u201cAs a game developer working on a project of a decent size (meaning several MBs of code and hundreds GBs of assets) I often stumble upon problems related to limited computing power of my machine. Usually, what takes substantial time is the \u201casset cooking\u201d. However, sometimes the compilation of my code can eat up my precious time too. Adding it all up, it seems that part of my salary is literally wasted on staring at progress bars.\u201d says Cyryl Matuszewski, Hoard\u2019s Lead Programmer.These hours of talks resulted in multiple ideas for joint collaboration on essential tooling for gamedev, to name a few: code compilation, processing textures, processing geometry, shader pre-compilation or computation related to light distribution. All these solutions using decentralized computing power. We strongly believe that the above can be a turning point in game development and the next step in moving it towards web 3.0.This collaboration also allows for creating a dynamic feedback loop, so that at the end both teams deliver the best possible product to all the game developers, who decide to build on Golem. Subsequently, both team\u2019s core strengths, when combined, resulted in a seamless and organic collaboration.Hoard\u2019s Code Compiler powered by Golem UnlimitedThe first use case that will be developed by Hoard \u2014 in cooperation with the Golem Unlimited team \u2014 is a code compiler built on Golem Unlimited, which is designed to unburden developers from typical distributed computing hassles: provisioning nodes, work distribution, load balancing, data transfer and more. Golem Unlimited allows subnetwork management from a single web console, where you can see total capacity as well as each node detailed info, create new tasks, get work status and set utilization policies.At first, Golem will enable a compilation of currently developed code using teammates joint desktop processing power. The user creates an internal trusted subnetwork of computers with one of them, called the hub. The hub, in this case, is the Requestor and other available computers join its network as Providers to work on tasks sent by the hub. In this stage, Hoard serves two roles: advisory in the context of requirements from the gamedev perspective and as an \u201cexternal\u201d dev team preparing this integration.No more interrupted computing \u2014 Unlimited will prioritize tasks according to the policy set by a local admin. Hub will control the computing power available on each machine within the subnetwork and assign tasks accordingly.As an added value, the user can use Golem Unlimited not only to perform tasks generated by the team internally, but they are also able to sell all subordinate idle computing power and earn GNT as a Golem Network \u201cfat\u201d Provider.A GU hubBut this is just the tip of the iceberg. The milestones of the Hoard Code Compiler include:Distributed compilation of shaders (thousands of shaders will be compiled substantially faster when preparing a build in the Unreal Engine).Recompression of textures \u2014 to see which method gives the best efficiency gain without having to wait for hours.Baking of global illumination data, shadows, and static lighting.At the same time, both Hoard and Golem are fully aware that, as with every innovation, it\u2019s easier to talk about all those world-changing solutions, than to actually deliver them. That\u2019s why we plan to focus on that first step and see where it leads us.The Hoard Code Compiler powered by Golem Unlimited will be, after it\u2019s stabilized and in production, connected to the main Golem network. More details about this will be announced on upcoming progress reports on the Hoard blog.\u201cHoard is committed to building a better future for gamedev. A future,where computing power is not an issue or a limitation. This path requires extensive plugin development for IDEs starting with Microsoft Visual Studio and game engines like Unreal Engine or Unity3D. We\u2019re convinced that it\u2019s worth the effort.\u201d \u2014 Slawomir Bubel, Hoard\u2019s CEOTwo forces \u2014 One goalTo be successful in achieving the proposed joint goals, the two teams need to work closely together: Golem Unlimited and Hoard.Currently, Golem Unlimited is in its alpha phase, meaning that not all features are yet implemented and the API is not stable. However, we are getting ready to release v0.2 as beta software.We are excited to work closely with the Hoard team to unleash a game-changer solution to the gamedev industry. To do that our efforts will focus on:Fully supporting windows with GPUs as gamedev utilize mainly this platform.Design and implement a smart load balancer with a failover feature.Enable provider current usage profile and tune jobs not to distract the local user operations, in order to allow artists and developers to use different workstations.Upgrade our UX to smooth altered/modded game engine provisioning for provider nodes.Curious about Hoard?Hoard\u2019s primary goal is to ensure the True Ownership of virtual assets in video games, using Ethereum and Plasma. Thanks to the True Ownership players are able to spend their in-game loot in the real world, and developers are able to monetize their games in new ways.To achieve this goal, Hoard provides developers with a free and open source SDK to enable easy asset tokenization, along with a decentralized exchange to generate new revenue streams. To understand Hoard\u2019s vision better watch their \u201c2 Minute Explainer Video\u201d.Though, Hoard goes one step further. They want to provide the best possible solutions for the developers to make the whole game development process more user-friendly and accessible. They want to lower the entry threshold barrier (through, among others providing a well-optimized code compiler).To give examples of Hoard\u2019s doing. In partnership with OmiseGO, Hoard released the first ever Plasma application \u2014 a game, called Plasma Dog, which is optimized to process approximately 4k transactions per second or 65k transactions per Ethereum block.Their upcoming integration, My Memory of Us, originally released last Fall, is currently available on Xbox One, Playstation 4, the Nintendo Switch, and Steam.Find more information on this diverse and interesting project on Hoard\u2019s website.We hope you enjoyed this blogpost and are happy about this collaboration.

Web 2.0 was the writable phase where users generated content. Google, Facebook, Twitter, and other \u201ccentralized\u201d services dominated the Internet with user content for the past 15 years. These free services have made us (their users) their products. The next phase of the Internet (Web 3.0) will be decentralized.Today\u2019s Internet-based companies have built very tall \u201cwalled-gardens\u201d or closed eco-systems. Fortunately, many of these companies have introduced APIs to allow developers to read and write to their centralized services; however, we\u2019ve all seen what happens when a company like Twitter decides to change the rules of the game \u2014 startups, developers, and users pay.Coincidently, many people believe that the Internet (as we know it today) has reached a point of extreme fragility and is one hack away from becoming permanently unavailable. Let\u2019s rewind, the initial implementation of the Internet was called ARPANET. It was designed as a decentralized Internet where each node maintained a host file that mapped website domains to IP addresses allowing a webbrowser to access any website in a peer-to-peer (P2P) fashion.Domain Name System (DNS) was introduced a few years before ARPANET was decommissioned. DNS made it possible to quickly grow Internet domains and content but at a price. The Mirai botnet attack recently demonstrated just how easy it is to bring down most of the centralized websites using a simple Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attack using Internet of Things (IoT) connected camera devices.Cloud platforms such as Amazon\u2019s AWS, Microsoft\u2019s Azure, and IBM\u2019s Softlayer were built to make it easy for \u201ccentralized\u201d apps and data to quickly setup and scale as needed. These cloud platforms offer centralized storage such as AWS S3, centralized DNS such as AWS Route 53, centralized servers such as AWS EC2, and now centralized functions such as AWS Lambda.Tomorrow\u2019s companies and technologies will be \u201cdecentralized\u201d. This means that their technology (and data) will no longer be hosted in centralized cloud services like AWS or Azure but rather on decentralized and distributed blockchains or mesh computing platforms like Computes.Decentralized applications (Dapps) and data will will soon be controlled and accessed by users directly in a P2P fashion similar to our ARPADYNE decentralized web experiment. Rather than IP addresses, content will be accessed by hashes similar to those used by IPFS. (In fact, Firefox and Brave browsers are already working on native IPFS support and other decentralized protocols.) There will be no single point of failure or control in these new decentralized networks. Users will finally control their own data. Hackers will continue to target Web 2.0 companies but will no longer be able to access Web 3.0 user accounts due to lack of centralized databases.While attending Stanford\u2019s recent BPASE blockchain conference, I couldn\u2019t help but notice how competitive the decentralized startup landscape had already become. New decentralized tech startups were already positioning themselves as the new \u201cfacebook\u201d and new \u201cnetflix\u201d or \u201cyoutube\u201d and new \u201cairbnb\u201d or \u201cuber\u201d of Web 3.0. If you think about it, Computes and Filecoin could become the new \u201cAWS\u201d or \u201cAzure\u201d of Web 3.0.Computers are made up of three components: network (IPFS), storage (Filecoin), and compute (Computes). Presented together, we are creating a very valuable computing platform in B2B markets as private mesh computers as well as B2C markets as public mesh computers. Organizations seem very interested in using Computes and Filecoin to reclaim their latent CPUs/GPUs and storage essentially creating private mesh computers everywhere. Here\u2019s a quick sketch of how I envision our platforms working together.If this Web 3.0 momentum doesn\u2019t get the attention of well established Web 2.0 companies, perhaps DAOs will. There are new \u201ccompanies\u201d forming and self organizing as DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations). These DAOs have no conventional management structure or board of directors. In fact, they may not even belong to a particular country. Their existence is governed by their decentralized user communities and developers. Dapps execute code (or smart contracts) on decentralized blockchains and mesh computers when virtual conditions or real-world events transpire.Web 3.0 (decentralization) is the most profound change in the Internet since its inception. Since all communications, Dapps, and data are P2P, there are no more middlemen, government eavesdropping, or walled gardens. It\u2019s certainly a brave new world. The businesses that embrace Web 3.0 and decentralize will be better positioned to meet their new competition.", "responses": 1, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Decentralization", "Decentralized", "Decentralized Web", "Cloud Computing"]}, {"title": "The Hydro dApp Store to Power the Fintech Web 3.0", "post_link": "https://medium.com/hydrogen-api/the-hydro-dapp-store-to-power-the-fintech-web-3-0-7fe548cc0cb0?source=search_post", "author_name": "Hydrogen", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@hydrogenapi", "publish_date": "2018-11-21", "last_modified_date": "2018-11-21", "readtime": "1.33", "claps": 651, "voters": 23, "content": "The Hydro dApp Store to Power the Fintech Web 3.0HydrogenFollowNov 21, 2018 \u00b7 2 min readWith the introduction of ERC-1484 (branded as Hydro Snowflake), the Hydro core protocol team has created the first way to tie any digital identity to decentralized applications (known as \u201cdApps\u201d).

There\u2019s no doubt about that. Eventually, they won\u2019t just be used for speculation. They\u2019ll be a means to exchange value between people, organizations, and ultimately \u2014 machines.Cryptocurrencies are protocol-native payment solutionsThe networks of today are private, closed off silos of information that only communicate with the outer world through defined interfaces. Eventually, these systems will require greater flexibility and autonomy if they are to cooperate to serve us in ways not possible before.Think of all the friction that currently exists with online payments, for example. Bank transactions are slow for a reason. And no one really knows how it works. Unless you\u2019re working at PayPal or Venmo, you probably don\u2019t know why funds take 3\u20135 business days to appear in your account.What\u2019s also funny is that the HTTP protocol has a 402 Payment Required status code. It\u2019s likely this was to be used for a built-in digital payment system, but was never developed.Soon enough, services that require some form of payment will speak the same language at the network level, making conditional transactions so simple that developers won\u2019t have to think about the complexities \u2014 kind of how today\u2019s web developers don\u2019t really need to know the inner workings of protocols like TCP/IP.Decentralized platforms like Ethereum enable systems to exchange value in a trust-less environment. They execute the instructions of smart contracts exactly as they are programmed and securely transfer the ownership of digital tokens.Right now, lots of projects are creating their own utility token \u2014 a token that provides access to a platform or service and acts a sort of access key.To best paint a picture for how utility tokens will be used, let\u2019s use an already \u201cdecentralized\u201d company, one that easily compliments blockchain technology \u2014 Airbnb.Services in the sharing economy such as Airbnb and Uber stand to be the first to truly benefit from peer-to-peer networks enabled by blockchain technologyAirbnb\u2019s utility token would be at the center of its ecosystem. This token will be the currency exchanged for all its services, meaning that you\u2019ll be exchanging fiat for tokens and then using those tokens when paying for your stay. I have to mention that the exchange from fiat will require good UX to abstract away the idea that you\u2019re buying a cryptocurrency. The barrier to entry needs to be as low as possible otherwise we\u2019ll never see adoption.Blockchain technology enables peer-to-peer payments, so when paying for your stay, you\u2019ll actually be sending the funds directly to your host \u2014 not some escrow service. Of course, there will also be logic in the protocol to handle disputes and manage the routing of funds. Because it\u2019s offering a service, the protocol might take a small percentage, but it\u2019ll be magnitudes lower than a bank\u2019s or payment processor\u2019s fees due to the lowered processing cost.Utility tokens will power decentralized protocols, enabling the automation of complex agreements and facilitating payments for servicesIf you\u2019re a host and have just been paid for a weekend booking, you\u2019ll have these tokens available in your account. You could cash out if you wanted to, receiving exactly the original amount agreed to in fiat. However, you\u2019ll also have the option of holding the tokens, taking stake in the continued success of the service and directly benefitting from the rise in token value.Right now, only those who invest in company stocks benefit from the value of the company rising. The value of a company is derived by the value it produces and it\u2019s generally generated by its network. This could be a network of efficient trucks, truck drivers, and supply chains. In the case of digital networks like those of Facebook and Google, the value is derived by the use of its services, the number of active users, and the data generated. Users don\u2019t gain anything from scrolling through Facebook, even though Facebook does have much to gain from your attention and time. Having publicly-traded utility tokens allow everyone to participate in the network effects of a successful service.The services of Web 3.0 will be decentralized platforms with levels of abstracted complexity.

Here\u2019s a summary of our time in Europe, including video and slides of our full Devcon4 presentation!The Enigma team at Devcon!Hello to the Enigma community! The Enigma team has just returned to their homes and offices across the globe from an incredible time in Europe. From Web3Summit and Devcon4 to all the great meetups in between, it was an ideal opportunity to connect with a whole universe of talented developers and thinkers \u2014 as well as to bring the global Enigma development team together for their first working retreat.Here\u2019s a quick trip report from our travels, complete with video and photos!BerlinFred (left) and Can (right) arrive at Web3Summit!Monday, Oct. 22nd \u2014The Enigma team (Can and Fred) arrives for the first day of Web3Summit. We packed our day with meetings and caught up with old friends and potential partners. The conference was just the right size \u2014 expansive, but still intimate \u2014 and it felt like you could talk to anyone and everyone. We also had a great dinner with thought leaders in the space to discuss the future of the ecosystem (and humanity).Tuesday, Oct 23rd \u2014 Our second day at Web 3 Summit. We spent the morning preparing for our midday Enigma workshop. We were able to attend a few sessions over the course of the day, including Starkware\u2019s presentation on privacy and a session where Gavin Wood went over the Substrate model.The Enigma session itself was heavily attended, with people standing at the back at the room. Can gave a brief introduction to the project to set the stage, and Fred went into a technical deep-dive of the Enigma network. The crowd was extremely engaged and asked very relevant questions, which we were pleased to answer. Overall, it was an extremely successful session!Fred presents a detailed look at Enigma on stage at Web3.Can giving an overview of fundamental applications for Enigma\u2019s platform.Wednesday, October 24th \u2014 Our last day at Web3Summit. We took in a few of the presentations and got ready for our evening Meetup with Ocean Protocol and Chainlink!The Meetup was very well attended, with lots of engagement and great questions for all the presenters. Thanks to our friends at Ocean Protocol for hosting and recording the talks! We were fortunate to have extensive conversations with both the Ocean and Chainlink teams after our presentations. Here\u2019s the Enigma presentation in full:And here\u2019s a look at the crowd!After working from a blockchain co-working space called Full Node on Thursday (and some productive meetings with other projects!) it was time to head to Prague\u2026Prague / Devcon4Enigma was well represented in Prague, bringing the majority of our dev team to Devcon4! This was one of our most anticipated events of the year, with thousands of Ethereum developers from across the world in attendance.Monday, October 29th \u2014 We attended a private, invite-only event focused on secure hardware where Fred made a presentation on technical details of Enigma\u2019s upcoming Discovery network. We\u2019ll have more to share soon!Tuesday, October 30th \u2014 Both of our development teams from the US and Israel got together in a tight shared AirBNB space. For two whole days, with barely any breaks, we locked ourselves in that room and we went into detail over every aspect of Discovery architecture, internally debating the pros and cons of different design choices. The (occasionally heated) arguments led to several breakthroughs on what our design should look like.Among the topics discussed and for which decisions were made is our handling of key management. Being the first end-to-end encrypted public network, this is a contentious and delicate issue to manage. We\u2019ve made great progress deciding how key management should be handled in the early iteration of the network, and going forward. The goal is to build more robustness and security over time.Other crucial topic relates to the design of sharding in our system, and what kind of consensus protocol this would require (both short term and long term). The main decision reached was that for each epoch (the basic time unit in our system), we will shard the network into worker groups, each entrusted with the maintenance of a single secret contract. This discussion let to resolving the difficult and very important question on how to reach consensus across each worker group inside of an epoch and outside of it.From left to right: Isan, Victor, Fred, and Elichai hard at work on Enigma!Wednesday, October 31st \u2014 Devcon4 kicked off in full. We attended a number of different sessions focused on privacy (including P4 Private Periodic Payment Protocol and Iden3). We also had some interesting meetings related to our tech, privacy and UX verticals. For instance, we met with OmiseGo to discuss our approach to scalability as well as their plans with respect to plasma, privacy and DEXes. In addition, we met with a senior executive at Intel to discuss potential next steps for our collaboration. Stay tuned\u2026Thursday, November 1st \u2014 We presented for the first time at Devcon4! Guy presented our sybil-resistance project in collaboration with Datawallet at the Intel Trusted Compute workshop. Members of our team attended a number of interesting sessions, including the Ethereum P2P talks and a libp2p meeting. We also attended presentations focusing on MakerDAO, Casper, Verifiable Delay Functions, and Ethereum Randomness. We had a great team lunch and practiced for our main presentation.Our CEO and co-founder Guy Zyksind presenting on stage!Friday, November 2nd\u2014 Time for the main event! Guy and Isan presented on privacy-preserving smart contracts at 12:30, complete with a full demo of \u201csecret voting\u201d, an announcement of our EGG (Enigma Growth Grants) program, and an exclusive look at some partner code! We were also able to go into some of the history of Enigma, including how we got started at MIT.The room filled rapidly after Enigma\u2019s talk began. Our presentation was very well received by a super engaged crowd, with great follow-up questions and a lot of interest afterwards.

This was a good recap of the state of research with an in-depth presentation about Plasma Cash. We\u2019ve learned that the most mature Plasma implementations (Loom\u2019s Plasma Cash and OmiseGo\u2019s Plasma MVP) still only support UTXO-based proofs \u2014 although more general implementation could theoretically leverage zero-knowledge proofs or TrueBit\u2019s interactive proofs. The deposit / withdrawal requirement is still a usability challenge, especially with withdrawals which become liquid only after a challenge period (defaulted to seven days). To mitigate this, Loom proposed a market for auctioning withdrawals at a discount during the challenge period to independent validators. Another issue with withdrawals is that Ethereum miners have an unfair advantage. They can view and validate the challenges submitted in transaction candidates in an attempt to steal rewards. A fascinating conversation!We spent the rest of the day meeting with other development teams, including a long and productive conversation with Chainlink about the viability of oracles. We tried our best to meet as many members of Enigma\u2019s global community as we could, including some of our incredible Ambassadors. We also made a few media appearances, including shooting an interview with our friend Michael from Boxmining!Outside of everything above, we had a number of meetings with current and prospective partners and had uncountable awesome interactions with developers in the Ethereum ecosystem. We\u2019re very fortunate and proud to be contributing our privacy and scalability solutions to such an incredible space. Everyone is so committed to building a better, more decentralized future.Thank you to everyone we met in Europe, and to everyone we\u2019ll meet soon! Next stop for Enigma: South Korea! For the first time, our team will be attending a major Asian conference and speaking about the present and future of Enigma as well as our privacy and scalability solutions.

Cultures change. People change. Technologies change. Even the internet itself is not immune to the relentless march of transformation. It\u2019s been through two major iterations in the last fifteen years, and a third one is on the way.As the cofounders of Whttl, Tim & I have had quite the opportunity to evaluate a ton of \u201c-as-a-service\u201d startups, including those in categories such as ridesharing, home cleaning, food delivery, and on demand rental cars. In fact, our internal database now has over 500 startups under review. (As we evaluate them, we\u2019re publishing more and more.) We can\u2019t help but to extract a massive wave of change that we see coming. With the rise of \u201cinternet of things\u201d and \u201cpush-a-button-get-something\u201d apps, humanity is combining the offline and online worlds like never before.In its mainstream infancy, the \u2018net was only a one way street for content. A privileged few had the technical chops to actually publish content. The vast majority of the community merely consumed said material. This cross section of users had no substantial affect on the composition of the web. Connected people lamented in the ubiquitous access to knowledge and resources, and titans of industry like Yahoo & Google were conceptualized, created, and cemented. We now reflect back on this period in the internet timeline as web 1.0. I like to refer to this as the information layer.In the mid 2000\u2019s, things started to change. We began sharing photos, thoughts, and experiences with one another. Blogging became more popular, and afforded average internet users a medium to broadcast their voice. They could create compelling and powerful 140 character messages, or distribute 100,000 word ebooks. Governments were overthrown. Social and civil reform gained the critical momentum needed to warrant change. For the first time, the internet comprised of nearly equal parts contributors and consumers. Barriers to entry for contributing knowledge, insight, and general trolldom were reduced to near null. Power was redistributed from the few to the many, and a democratic digital age was ushered in. We call this web 2.0, and it was the first major iteration of the internet. It represented a fundamental change, and the titans of this industry were Facebook and Twitter. I call this the social layer.But alas, the march continues onward. Web 2.0 will be followed by another iteration, of which the exact nomenclature is to be determined. (Many experts dismiss the \u201cweb 3.0\" term.) Long touted as the the semantic web, the vision is that information can readily be interpreted by machines, so that they can perform more of the tedious work involved in finding, processing, and acting upon information on the web.In other words, you won\u2019t need to tell your mobile device/smart watch/wearable/futuristic robo-butler what to look for. Rather, your bionic pal will tell you what you want to know, before you even implicitly ask. Moreover, it will even act on your behalf.We are starting to see it already.IFTTT allows a user to create recipes to plug automated events into the real world. For example, create a recipe of \u201cIf I\u2019ve had more than 4 meetings in a day, then turn on the hot tub\u201d and you\u2019ll be soaking away the stress before you know it. Attach the Whistle dongle to your dog\u2019s collar, and create \u201cIf my dog hasn\u2019t had 30 minutes of exercise, then put an appointment on my calendar to walk her this evening.\u201d One of my personal favorites is \u201cIf my wife lands at the airport, then flash the lights in the house green.\u201dGoogle has been one of the leading innovators in the space. Their mobile product, known as Google Now, has the ability to serve up information, before you actually need it. Through the use of predictive cards, they can cue up sports scores for your favorite teams\u2019 games, driving direction to upcoming meetings, and information on restaurants, hotels, and venues relevant to where you are. It\u2019s no longer fast enough to answer queries in near real time. Instead, Google cofounder & CEO Larry Page is adamant that the answers need to be provided before the question is even asked.In the travel space, we have Adioso. The team built a product that doesn\u2019t need a user to input constraints like exact dates and destinations, but rather a general concept. Want to travel somewhere tropical over the Christmas break for as cheap as possible? Boom, they\u2019ve got you covered. They\u2019ll serve up the best trip for you, determined with algorithms, computations, and artificial intelligence. You aren\u2019t forced to input objective data to plan your trip. Instead, they give you the freedom to offload the burden of the minutia off to the bots.And finally, let\u2019s chat about Push For Pizza. Despite the introduction of online ordering from nearly all pizza joints over the last decade, let\u2019s be honest, it\u2019s a pain in the butt to order a pie. Creating accounts, entering credit card information, and choosing toppings from a seemingly infinite selection of combinations and meal deals can be enough to resort to raiding the fridge for leftovers. Push For Pizza ripped all that unnecessary complexity out and asks one simple question: \u201cWould you like cheese or pepperoni?\u201d Ninety five percent of the decision tree has been offloaded to bits so you can focus on bites.Digital, meet analog. Analog, meet digital. I think you two will get along nicely. You heard it first here, folks, I\u2019m dubbing this new wave as the transaction layer.I think it\u2019s safe to say that Uber has already taken one of the tops spots for a titan of industry in the on-demand age. They combine digital computation with physical logistics, and are working towards more accurate prediction and placement of vehicles. Their secret sauce ultimately lies in their ability to have a car never more than a couple minutes away. And it\u2019s going to get even more intuitive.Mark my words. There will come a time when you will step out of a meeting, ride the elevator down to the ground floor, walk to the curb, and an Uber (or Lyft) will pull up. You didn\u2019t specifically call the car, yet you didn\u2019t have to wait. The system just knew you were going to need a ride.I can\u2019t help but to think of this hilarious clip from Dodgeball where the scooter arrives instantly at the snap of White Goodman\u2019s fingers.Want to contribute to making this a reality? Become an Uber driver.Call it creepy. Call it too much. I call it damn convenient.Let\u2019s rewind the clock a little bit and pretend it is 2004, the heyday of web 1.0. Imagine you are hungry for some grub. You would go into Google, type \u201cfood delivery\u201d, and review the results that come up. You\u2019d do some research and narrow down your options, and then commit to one company. You\u2019d make your purchase, either online or over the phone. Food would show up 30 minutes later.Now, let\u2019s look at 2014, when web 2.o is in full swing. You\u2019re hungry again. (Amazing how that happens, huh?) You post a Facebook status that says \u201cWho\u2019s the best delivery joint in SF?\u201d Four of your friends reply. Because two of them answered that SpoonRocket is the best, you conclude that\u2019s the company to go with. You order your food and half-an-hour later, you are grubbin\u2019 down.You ready for what 2020 has in store? (Drumroll please.) You tell your phone, smart watch, or home assistant, \u201cI\u2019m hungry for some Thai Food.\u201d The system looks at what you\u2019ve ordered before and what your friends have recommended over the years. It processes a number of different parameters, decides the best option, and then places the order for you. The food shows up at your door, perfectly timed as you get home from work. Time to pig out.You didn\u2019t order your food because of a high search result placement. You didn\u2019t order it because your friends directly suggested it. It was ordered for you because the system selected the highest likelihood of a satisfactory order.With each successive advance of technological iterations, the prior generation is put to pasture, so to speak. Even before web 1.0, radio had an adverse effect on print advertising. Then, TV stole some of the thunder from radio. Later, web 1.0 stole the show from TV. At present day, web 2.0 is garnering all the attention for ad spend. Search Engine Marketing is being displaced by Social Media Marketing.What\u2019s next in the pipeline? Tim & I believe that the next big opportunity is in preferred transaction partners. When all of these transactions happen automatically behind the scenes, the players that can get in front of more transactions will earn the business. That\u2019s where we come in.Here at Whttl, we are very bullish with this hypothesis. In fact, we are already building technology that will embrace the transaction ecosystem. Whenever there are competitors in any one category (same day delivery, home cleaning, on-demand rental cars), we think it is inefficient to treat them all as disparate products that require separate engagement. All available options should be in one spot, easy for the user to digest and make a quick decision. In this setup, the number of decisions a user needs to make is drastically reduced, thanks to smart computing power.Only time will tell when people are ready to completely hand off the entire purchasing burden to bots. It could be five years, ten years, or even a couple decades. In the interim, we\u2019ll keep working hard at Whttl to make the point of purchase as close to semantic as possible.In San Francisco, we\u2019ve already made our first big step here. We recently introduced a feature that combines the inventories of the major meal delivery startups, so that you can order from any of them in one spot. (Note: enter a San Francisco ZIP code, such as 94102, to see the product in action.) It\u2019s not yet predictive, but technical innovation suggests such capability is only an inevitable function of time. In the interim, it\u2019s a sure bet way to integrate all of your favorite food delivery services into the transaction layer.If you found value in this, it would be tremendous if you scrolled down a little further and hit the \u201cRecommend\u201d button.Greg Muender is the founder of Whttl, described as the \u201cKayak.com for startups.\u201d Use it to connect to new on demand services that roll out to your ZIP code.

Advertising as the only form of revenue online needs to be eradicated if anything the scale and ambition of Web 3.0 are to emerge and flourish. Even the least ambitious ideals of the internet at its conception has not been realized and instead the world we live in is a centralized monopoly dominated by a diminishing number of too big to fail companies.When few companies dictate the terms of our participation we should always pause for thought. When the outcome of those conditions is the destruction of any semblance of privacy it is critical that we revolt before it\u2019s too late. Free was an awesome model for gaining mass adoption online but we must quickly realize the cost for relinquishing ownership of our data and recognize what we are paying in terms of a lack of controls on our privacy. In short free means exploitation at a scale never before seen in human history.So how do we get there?To begin to take back control there must be a blurring of the boundary between data and finance, the analog and digital worlds, where a data bank enables your participation at zero friction. In order to participate in this cyclical economy, we need a digital passport which collects our data, protects it, lets you monetize it while enabling the payments alluded to above. It needs to be instantaneous and it has to happens without any need to confirm. We need to be able to trust that third parties will only as for the fee promised and they need to trust that it will be paid. Blockchain solves all these problems.This will be achieved by a distributed model of digital taxation. This will take the form of metered-micropayments for all products, services or content you consume online \u2014 compensating creators equal to your engagement. Where industries have died, digital tokens will enable those things which acquire most attention to thrive. Cryptocurrency has been fascinating but we are currently in the replication phase \u2014 where people are trying to reinvent what currently exists \u2014 instead of doing things with blockchain and cryptocurrency which were previously impossible.Today FinTech companies are innovating around existing products and services to create a better customer experience, tomorrow they will need to do far more. The future we imagine is akin to a Netflix of Financial services. Fintechs are on the brink of offering consumers a personalized menu of products instead of one-size-fits-all services. This must merge with our digital footprint online in order for us to ensure we get the best value for everything.The worlds data bank will effectively place every individual in control of all of their data. Instead of isolated bits of information existing on millions of servers around the world ready to be hacked, we will demand that we are the only people who hold it.What else?Peer to peer has been awesome for platform creators but terrible for gig economy workers. As Ubers Valuation has skyrocketed into the hundreds of Billions, rewards for drivers have plummetted. In short, the compensation for providing the service and maintaining the platforms are misaligned. This will change. Service providers will be rewarded with equity in the underlying business through new fractional ownership models. Every trip will equate to a higher stake of ownership. Drive more? Own more. This is what a blurring of the financial world and the establishment of data banks enables.Last mile delivery is about to explode. It\u2019s relatively cheap to get a large volume of goods from one geographic location to another but It\u2019s ridiculously expensive to get it from one place in that city to a large number of addresses. Look for there to be a number of VC backed players emerge in this space in the next 18 months. They will initially tie together D2C companies and their community, enabling those businesses to leverage the engagement of the crowd to let their customers benefit and lower delivery costs significantly. I guarantee a unicorn emerges in this domain by 2020.Crowdfunding is dead, long live crowdfunding. Investing in equity is prehistoric, consumer purchasing behavior will become a new form of investing. Voting with your wallet will mean owning through your decisions. Buy something, own it, buy more, own more. Instead of purchasing stocks and shares, everyday consumers will accrue ownership of the futures most exciting companies through their existing purchasing behavior. This means that the can of coke you are drinking would be a tiny fraction of equity in the business, equally the chocolate bar in your pocket or the soap in your bathroom. Wealth will be redistributed. Where in the past the only beneficiaries of our actions were the shareholders in the business which produced the things we consume \u2014 there will be a mass reaction against this. Technology will enable a swarm of individuals to cohesively act as one for mutual economic benefit. This will give rise to co-operatively owned brands which produce a vast number of the things we consume. People will be incentivized to act as selfishly as possible, benefitting everyone who does so as well.Web 3.0 and BeyondThe internet has sparked the third industrial revolution, but like each previous to this one, it has resulted in centralization and monopolized control of all assets and utilities. To evolve past this and the rewards to be more equally spread we must appreciate then understand the impossible. The internet has allowed things that could never have been achieved before to happen but like the analog world before it, we translated those structures and institutions to a digital domain because they were familiar and easy to process.Their time has passed and what\u2019s needed is an alternative. All innovation online begins at the periphery of legality. In the same way that Napster was a direct precursor to Spotify and the peer-to-peer companies that dominate today, how are companies that are blocked from using advertising to generate revenue making money?Web 3.0 needs a new trust architecture to integrate with that of the past. For me, that means finance and data becoming one of the same things. Our money and our information will become one of the same and we will become the guardians and beneficiaries of our digital and physical existence.Or it couldIf we just see the benefits", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Fintech", "Startup", "Web Development", "Blockchain", "Life"]}, {"title": "Infinite opportunity in web 3.0, here\u2019s why you should know about it", "post_link": "https://medium.com/internet-of-blockchain/infinite-opportunity-in-web-3-0-heres-why-you-should-know-about-it-bd8e8a6f7d42?source=search_post", "author_name": "Matteo Gianpietro Zago", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@matteozago", "publish_date": "2018-11-07", "last_modified_date": "2018-11-07", "readtime": "3.43", "claps": 156, "voters": 16, "content": "Infinite opportunity in web 3.0, here\u2019s why you should know about itMatteo Gianpietro ZagoFollowNov 7, 2018 \u00b7 4 min readWhat was the world like before the internet? Were we better off without cat videos, constant advertising, social media addiction and online shopping?The truth is, the internet was like a technological nuclear bomb that shook the world in so many ways that were unimaginable. It completely altered global economics and changed the way humans interoperate.But, just like any new system or arrangement, it was susceptible to unforeseeable flaws and loopholes. Now, as it turns out, the corporate internet giants took advantage of these faults and built systems that were against the interests of the masses who supported them.They disregarded privacy and security, with personal information trawled into huge centralized data silos ready to be plucked out and used often without knowing consent. By doing so they made the internet unsafe, by designing targets of goldmines for hackers.The Web 2.0 to 3.0 Paradigm ShiftThankfully, we now have a successor to fix the flaws in this broken system. This new era of technology is brought about by decentralized and blockchain resources and we are already seeing it take influence. It\u2019s most often identified as the Web 3.0, and it\u2019s shaking business models at their core.You could think of the Web 3.0 as an advanced distributed network of computing. It\u2019s powered by open-source technologies such as protocols and software platforms. It boast unprecedented levels of security, and most significantly, there are no centralized servers .Such developments are offers swathes of fertile ground for new opportunities. Not only for developers but for businesses and enterprises alike. The Web 3.0 permits entirely different models to work where users introduce value to the network themselves without the need for middlemen.The Internet of Blockchain Foundation co-founder Matteo Gianpietro Zago said his interest in creating a foundation was based upon the lack clarity in mainstream audiences. He stated that the IOBF\u2019s aim is to \u201cfurther adoption through understanding the ecosystem; at the moment the industry is extremely diverse, and we want to try and simplify it, such as what we have done with the infographic above.\u201dWhy the Web 3.0 is Beneficial for Business and ConsumersBusinesses in the Web 3.0 do not require personal data to operate . Anonymous connections are permitted through cryptographic methods and consumers have the power to retract access any data at any point in time. Information is shared on a case-by-case and permissioned basis in an encrypted way.In this digital age the issue of intellectual property has become highly controversial. The Web 3.0 offers the perfect solution. By putting work to the blockchain and imposing smart contracts, access can is recorded and permitted on certain parameters. This can ensure payments are made workers are rightly paid for their hard labor.With the shifting nature and advancement of hacking or fraudulent techniques, businesses need to be permanently conscious of information security. Through the blockchain, messages can be authenticated, signed and verified; thus no fake accounts, no interception, and manipulations made impossible..Contracts are an essential part of conducting business for legal, financial, practical and employment terms, but they are not always adhered to and can be broken easily. Blockchain technology has given us smart contract capabilities which ensure participated parties execute the terms and conditions. And even for small businesses who don\u2019t have the capital or means to enforce contracts, smart-contracts are cheaper, faster and more efficient. There is no middleman to pay or delay.All in all, whether you\u2019d like to trade art, energy, or virtual cats; or if you need to transfer capital, store documents, or prove authenticity, blockchain \u2014 and its surrounding ecosystem \u2014 now provides the best means possible to do that. While many projects will not prosper, a number will go on to play pivotal roles in our lives as we gravitate to the Web 3.0: a fairer and more user-centric model.Why the Internet of Blockchain Foundation was BornBlockchain technology holds the solutions for a the flaws in the current system. And a whole new fertile ground for business is being born. But with the benefits of Web 3.0 yet to reach mainstream audiences, we decided in 2017 to establish an organization devoted to its promotion and hastening adoption and its transition. This is how the \u2018Internet of Blockchain Foundation\u2019 was born.The IOBF board contains a list of leading blockchain pioneers and pundits who have invested heavily in visionary projects and ideas that are beneficial to fostering adoption. We aim to increase awareness through various platforms including international events, educational programs and think-tank conferences.We believe the future of technology depends on blockchain and the principle of decentralization.

This excerpt is the latest in a series from Convergence Ecosystem vision paper. Go and read the full thing here which can be read here. Or take a look at the previous excerpts which have covered core themes from the paper:Interoperability \u2014 Building the Internet of BlockchainsData Distribution \u2014 A Real Use Case for Blockchains: A Global Data CommonsData Collection \u2014 Building a New Data Infrastructure with Blockchains and the Internet of ThingsGovernance \u2014 The End of Scale: Blockchains, Community, & Crypto GovernanceThesis Introduction \u2014 VC for The Decentralised Future: Introducing the Convergence EcosystemMarketplaces are critical elements of the entire Convergence ecosystem; the element that incentivises data to be collected, shared and utilised. We now have the ability to open up the machine economy and need to think of \u2018trading\u2019 beyond the scope of human interaction. The sorts of marketplaces that are being developed in the crypto community are decentralised, automated and tokenized. These marketplaces are made possible because of the distributed ledgers, consensus mechanisms and interoperability protocols at the lower levels.We will see the emergence of a whole host of new types of marketplaces beyond just today\u2019s cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance or Coinbase. We are seeing the emergence of data exchanges that work with specific types of data; machine data from IoT networks, artificial intelligence data, personal data, and complex digital assets like crypto-collectables (pioneered by ERC 721 non-fungible tokens like CryptoKitties) and bots. It\u2019s likely that over time marketplaces will expand into enabling all types of data and if that does occur we could end up with a dominant data and digital asset marketplace for Web 3.0 like Amazon for the Web 2.0. It\u2019s interesting to think where the points of leverage will be in the Web 3.0 especially if value and data are interoperable across blockchains. Anyway at least for now, we see four types of decentralised data marketplace.IoT Data MarketplacesIoT data is already being collected in vast quantities, but the sprawl of devices has created a fragmented ecosystem. On the consumer side, operating system providers like Apple, Google and Amazon are attempting to leverage their dominant positions in smartphones and retail to sell more devices to collect more data. The Apple Watch and CarPlay, Google Home and Next, Amazon Echo and Dot; these are all attempts to grow their walled gardens of data. Smaller consumer IoT device makers like Fitbit, Wink, or GreenIQ struggle to collect enough data to make do meaningful machine learning to improve their products as quickly as the tech giants.On the enterprise side, the same dynamics are at work. The internet of things (IoT) and industrial internet in the United States, Industrie 4.0 in Germany, and \u7269\u8054\u7f51 (w\u00f9 li\u00e1n w\u0103ng) in China all promise to use low-cost sensors and big data analytics to dramatically improve productivity and usher in a new age of data-driven manufacturing. But the promise has not been realized for a number of reasons. Core to the failure has been the lack of data sharing. This lack of data sharing has been the case across all industries that are trying to utilise IoT technologies including aviation, agriculture, and utilities. The problem, as we have already highlighted, is that there is no incentive to share data because it is seen as the competitive advantage to be protected. Current data infrastructure is coarse: data is either hoarded and valuable, or shared with limited commercial viability. IoT marketplaces begin to offer new business models for the monetisation of machine data. The IOTA data marketplace, Streamr, Datum and Databroker DAO are all examples of these marketplace emerging to enable the sharing of sensor and machine data.AI Data MarketplacesJust like IoT data, or any data for that matter, data for AI algorithms tend to be accumulated by the largest companies. Society is becoming reliant on data, and as it applied to AI algorithms, we are facing a situation in which a select group of organisations are amassing vast datasets and building unassailable AI capabilities. With the emergence of deep learning as the most useful machine learning technique for a range of AI applications like computer vision and natural language processing, data has become like digital oil. Digital monopolies like Facebook, Google and Amazon, today get data from users for free. Every like, search and purchase feeds the learning system to further improve the algorithms; in turn bringing more customers and engagement. In value chain terms, data is supply, and AI algorithms are demand. Digital monopolies are searching everywhere for more and more data to feed their algorithms: Facebook buying WhatsApp and Instagram, Google with self-driving cars and Google Home, and Amazon with Alexa Echos and Dots.\u201cTraditionally proprietary data and technology have been significant defensibility mechanisms for companies. In the blockchain industry this is all open source, leading to an incredibly rapid innovation cycle, but also shifting defensibility more towards the sheer size of the community and thus the distribution power. This is an industry where increasingly users decide what technologies they want to use.\u201d \u2014 Teemu Paivinen, Founder, Equilibrium Labs & Author of Thin ProtocolsDecentralised AI data marketplaces will reduce, and eventually remove, the competitive advantage of hoarding private data by enabling anybody to monetise data. Again in value chain terms, these marketplaces increase supply. An AI data marketplace will make it easy for people and increasingly agents and bots to recommend, price and therefore find value in different types of data. A market for data will lead to more efficient allocation of data, rather than giving it away for free or not using it at all. As more and more machines, individuals and organisations upload data to sell on a data marketplace, it becomes more attractive to data buyers. As this data commons grows with more datasets, it will attract more data buyers, creating powerful network effects. More than anything, decentralised AI data marketplaces are a bulwark to the rapacious AI data monopolies that have the potential to become the most powerful organisations ever built (if they aren\u2019t already), controlling ever-increasing numbers of industries and markets with their superior AI capabilities. It is, for this reason, we invested in the Ocean Protocol, whose mission is \u201cto unlock data, for more equitable outcomes for users of data, using a thoughtful application of both technology and governance.\u201d\u201cThe aim of Ocean Protocol to to equalize the opportunity to access data, so that a much broader range of AI practitioners can create value from it, and in turn spread the power of data. To respect privacy needs, we must include privacy-preserving compute. Our practical goal is deploy a tokenised ecosystem that incentivizes for making AI data & services available. This network can be used as a foundational substrate to power a new ecosystem of data marketplaces, and more broadly, data sharing for the public good.\u201d \u2014 Trent McConaghy, Co-Founder, BigChainDB & Ocean ProtocolWe also expect to see these marketplaces become ever more automated and efficient. Another of our portfolio companies, Fetch, is building a solution that uses decentralised machine learning to enable marketplaces to self-evolve around popular or valuable datasets, improving discoverability. In some senses they are embedding marketplaces directly into the ledger to truly enable the machine economy.Personal Data MarketplacesAfter peer-to-peer payments, control of personal data has been one of the most talked about applications for blockchains. This is related to but separate from self-sovereign identity and SII networks like Sovrin, in the sense that once an individual controls their own identity, they can choose who can have access to it. The same principle can be applied to other personal data. This choice puts the individual in the position of the seller and the party who wants access to the data as the buyer. Personal data is an economic asset that we currently give up in return for services. Some data is handed over consciously, like entering an email address or a telephone number; other data is captured without us knowing about it: likes, tweets, our online behaviour and other forms of digital data exhaust. The value comes (albeit it is much less understood by individuals) when different datasets are aggregated, and an individual psycho-demographic profile is created and sold to all sorts of organisations like insurers, market researchers, and political organisations. A multi-billion dollar data industry exists just to trade personal data.Individual pieces of personal data are not particularly valuable on their own. According to the Financial Times, general information such as age, gender or location is worth just 0.0005 dollars per person. Buyers will have to fork out 26 cents per person for lists of people with specific health conditions. Genomic data would likely fetch much more. The challenge is that at an individual level, there is very little economic value. Value comes in aggregate. This is where blockchains, self-sovereign identity, and personal data wallets combine.In today\u2019s Web 2.0 paradigm, Google, Facebook and other data monopolists capture the profit. In the future, blockchain infrastructure, self-sovereign identity and personal data marketplaces will empower individuals. They can choose to allow Google and Facebook to use their data, or they can auction it off to get the best price. They might decide to only sell general information, but not their genomic data. Others will rent access to genomic data to cancer research charities but not insurers. New business models will emerge as buyers give sellers discounts based on aggregating family data for instance and new startups will emerge differentiating on consumer trust. Met\u00e2me is a UK-based startup working on creating a universal unit of trade enabling bundles of personal data to be packaged and exchanged. A data marketplace is not necessarily about making the most money. It is about giving individuals choice and control of how they want to invest their most valuable economic asset.\u201cSelf-sovereign personal data marketplaces need to address two key hurdles before they can take off: 1) the need for a universal unit of trade that transforms personal data into assets which people can tangibly trade and own, 2) ensuring anonymity and then incentivising consented identifiability as new legislation like GDPR effectively calls for anonymity by default. Without solutions to these problems personal data marketplaces cannot scale sustainably.\u201d Dele Atanda, CEO, Met\u00e2me LabsDigital Assets MarketplacesThe final category of marketplace we expect to evolve are digital asset marketplaces. Unlike traditional physical assets or money, distributed ledger-based crypto-tokens can be programmable. This gives them more flexibility and variety than their physical counterparts. Cryptocurrencies, or tokens designed to be a medium of exchange, are already reasonably well-defined and projects are innovating around how to create the optimal token for this use in mind with rules around supply, distribution, privacy, and other attributes being tweaked. Cryptocurrencies confer the fact that the crypto-token is a medium of exchange. Most tokens are incorrectly referred to as cryptocurrencies. This is because Bitcoin began life as a cryptocurrency and has over the last ten years become more of a crypto-asset, predominantly because of the programmed deflationary economics (Layer 2 solutions like Lightning may change this classification however). However, currencies and assets require different economic designs. Currencies need to have a high velocity; assets need to retain and ideally increase value resulting in low velocity.Broader than cryptocurrencies, digital assets will come to include all digitals assets that use distributed ledgers to create scarcity. Today there isn\u2019t a clear distinction between cryptocurrencies and crypto-assets, but as the market matures, it will become more evident which tokens are designed to be a medium of exchange and which are designed to be a store of value. It is challenging to be both. Ether, for example, is intended to be used as a medium of exchange to redeem decentralised services from applications. But as its price rises, it becomes more of a store of value and less of a medium of exchange as holders refrain from redeeming Ether in anticipation of value appreciation. This non-fungible subclass of crypto-assets will be designed to be collectables and derive value through exclusivity and proof-of-ownership. Tooling for this is already emerging with the ERC 721 NFTs.We expect to see a whole new ecosystem of digital assets like in-game weapons or costumes for gaming, AI bots and virtual avatar templates, such as those provided by SEED. Virtual reality land such as Decentraland; objects with real-world counterparts like digital twins from Spherity; and even digital to physical assets like 3D printed items, many of which will be collaboratively made and collectively owned. With digital scarcity comes the ability to artificially limit supply which has up until now been almost impossible with existing digital and Internet technologies.The possibilities are endless and we are at the very beginning of a whole new age of digital assets created, bought, licensed, rented and sold in decentralised peer-to-peer marketplaces.", "responses": 1, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Bitcoin", "Ethereum", "Decentralization", "Convergence"]}, {"title": "Tangle \u2014 the missing link for IoT and Web 3.0", "post_link": "https://medium.com/coinmonks/tangle-the-missing-link-for-iot-and-web-3-0-6519f22ebc81?source=search_post", "author_name": "Rohith Gandhi", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@grohith327", "publish_date": "2018-05-13", "last_modified_date": "2018-05-21", "readtime": "5.78", "claps": 222, "voters": 14, "content": "Tangle \u2014 the missing link for IoT and Web 3.0Rohith GandhiFollowMay 13, 2018 \u00b7 6 min readTo understand what Tangle is and why we need it, we need to know two concepts beforehand. They are Distributed Ledgers and Blockchains. For those of you who are aware of what distributed ledgers and Blockchains are, you can skip the next two sections, others, follow on and you would find a brief introduction to both of these concepts.Distributed LedgersLedgersAnybody who owns a bank account would be aware of ledgers. A ledger is a book or a computer file which keeps track of the economic transactions. Right now, these ledgers are centralised, i.e they are maintained by a single trusted authority called banks. The problem with centralised ledgers is that the trusted authority has complete control over them, they could decide to impose fines on your account or take money away from you without your consent. They can also shut down without any notice. Another huge problem with centralised ledgers is that they are highly prone to attacks, anyone with high computing power and malice can compromise the entire system. So, a solution proposed to this problem is distributed ledgers, i.e every participant has an identical ledger and new transactions are approved through consensus of participants. Therefore, now, there is no need for a middleman to approve transactions, hence the authority is distributed over the participants. Unlike centralised ledgers, distributed ledgers are more resistant to cyber attacks as the attacker has to take control of over 51% of the distributed network simultaneously. Distributed ledgers do not allow individuals to change the ledgers as they are immutable.BlockchainBlockchains are distributed ledgers that are completely open to anyone. On a basic level, Blockchains are a kind of linked list! many blocks are connected together to form a Blockchain(Duh!). The first block is called the genesis block and every block has three things, data, hash and hash of the previous block. A block is identified by its hash. The hash is unique to every block, it is similar to a fingerprint for the block. Any change in the data will also change the hash of the block. Therefore, this can be used to find out if data has been altered. When a malicious user tries to change the data of a block, he will inherently change the hash of the block, since Blockchains are formed using a linked-list like technique, this would make all the following blocks invalid. To ensure additional safety, another mitigation technique has been added which is called proof of work, i.e it takes 10 minutes to add a new block to the chain. This makes it highly resistant to attacks. Bitcoin, the digital cryptocurrency, uses a Blockchain to maintain it\u2019s transactions.I know most of you all are wondering, why we all haven\u2019t adapted to Blockchain already!! I know, but Blockchain has it\u2019s drawbacks as well. I think there is another technology that is out there that can overcome the difficulties of a Blockchain and it is called Tangle. Before moving on to Tangle, let us discuss the problems present in a blockchain.Problems with BlockchainThere are fees for each transaction. Bitcoin transaction fee is around 20$ and micropayments are most affected by this since any transaction below this amount is worthless as you would be paying more money as fees than the actual transaction amount.Scalability is another huge issue for Blockchain. As you can see from the above graph, bitcoin approves around 5\u20137 transactions per second whereas Visa approves around 2000 transactions. Bitcoin dubbed as the substitute for Visa must be able to keep up with those level of transactions. Right now, each bitcoin transaction takes up to 10 minutes to be approved, There are thousands of unconfirmed transactions. You can view the live unconfirmed transactions on Blockchain by clicking this link.Another issue with Blockchain is that it has become centralised to few powerful actors. Blockchains require huge computing power as the network size increases. Miners provide this computing power by validating the transactions on the network in exchange for a fee. So now, people with huge computing power turn into powerful players and seem to control the network. Now, this is centralisation and defeats the purpose of a Blockchain.A miner with a classical computer has to go through around 2\u2076\u2078 nonces(numbers only used once) to generate the hash of a block. If a person with a malicious intent uses a quantum computer, then he/she would have to go through only 2\u00b3\u2074 nonces, i.e a quantum computer is around 17 billion times faster than a classical one. Even though quantum computers aren\u2019t pervasive now, they could be in another 15\u201320 years. Quantum computers are in research stages and enterprises such as IBM have built prototypes and have aimed at making them commercially available. Blockchains hailed the as future isn\u2019t resistant to these quantum attacks.Now you may ask, isn\u2019t Blockchain a glorified linked list then? Yes!How Tangle overcomes these problems?The major difference between a Blockchain and Tangle lies in their structures. Blockchains are sequentially added blocks whereas Tangle is a DAG(Directed Acyclic Graph).DAGs are a hierarchy of nodes without any cycles, other applications of DAG are Git protocol, which uses a Merkle DAG, IPFS etc. IOTA is the cryptocurrency used by Tangle to handle transactions.As the number of users increases, Tangle actually gets faster contrary to the Blockchain. Another big advantage in Tangle is that there are no miners. So, how are the transactions approved now? to make a transaction you have to approve two randomly chosen transactions, this eliminates the need for miners and fees.In the above image, the grey nodes represent unconfirmed transactions. To make your own transaction you have to approve two unconfirmed transactions randomly chosen. These two transactions are chosen using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo(MCMC) algorithm, this algorithm ensures that one does not choose his own transaction to approve. Therefore, consensus and transaction generation are not decoupled in a Tangle, unlike Blockchain. Tangle is also resistant to quantum attacks as it uses winternitz one time signature.Drawback of TangleThe only problem with Tangle is that it is vulnerable when the network size is small and grows in strength as the number of users increases. To help kickstart the development of Tangle, it\u2019s creators have developed a coordinator which safeguards it from attacks. The coordinator can be considered as training wheels for the network which can be removed once the number of users has reached a threshold.Applications of TangleImagine each of our devices able to communicate with each other without the intervention of humans. Take the example of a car, each car will have it\u2019s own unique ID and wallet. This car can pay for tolls, parking etc on its own. With the dawn of autonomous cars, we can have a fleet of driverless cars where each car pays for its own tolls, parking and also charges a fee for its users. Tangle will also revolutionize supply chain management and many other fields.ConclusionTangle is the missing link, it helps connect every device together and allows each device to communicate with another without the help of humans. The era that we are in right now is truly amazing as new advances in AI are made every weekend and new technologies that could revolutionize the way we live our lives are being consistently invented. For an AI enthusiast, I don\u2019t think there was or would be a more exciting era to live in.", "responses": 1, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Iota", "Tangle", "Bitcoin", "Technology"]}, {"title": "5 Features that Make Bluzelle Excel as a Database for Web 3.0", "post_link": "https://blog.bluzelle.com/5-features-that-make-bluzelle-excel-as-a-database-for-web-3-0-aa2713abcfd8?source=search_post", "author_name": "Pavel Bains", "author_link": "https://blog.bluzelle.com/@pavelbains", "publish_date": "2019-07-24", "last_modified_date": "2019-08-02", "readtime": "3.08", "claps": 529, "voters": 13, "content": "5 Features that Make Bluzelle Excel as a Database for Web 3.0Pavel BainsFollowJul 24 \u00b7 4 min readAs Bluzelle has been continuously building its decentralized database, more features have been implemented and the pieces are all coming together. This week kicks off the first of a number of weekly blog posts around what makes the entire Bluzelle ecosystem work. This will include material about payments, nodes, staking, Ethereum registries and more. By the end of the series we\u2019ll have an updated white paper that reflects the exciting current state.Today\u2019s post is about 5 key features that make Bluzelle well positioned to be the leading database for Web 3.0.1. Simple to ImplementFor database architects (DBA), Bluzelle is simple to get going. The DBA just needs to know how much storage they need. They don\u2019t need to specify server sizes, memory, speeds, inputs/outputs and other info. As Bluzelle is auto-managed network, like blockchains, there is nothing to actually deploy. Bluzelle is already up and gives multi-region capability right away.Check out Bluzelle Guide: Integrating Bluzelle in less than 5 minutesTraditional databases ask a number of questions and have a complex set up. This frustrates developers who just want to get going on programming their software. Complex infrastructure is a distraction.2. Scale AutomaticallyWith Bluzelle, IT teams don\u2019t have to worry about managing operations to scale up for demand. Traditional databases require the company to react to customers in different regions and spin up new servers accordingly. With Bluzelle the developers just state which regions they want coverage in and as demand increases, Bluzelle ensures data is replicated there automatically to support the scale needed.3. Multi-cloud and Hybrid ModelBluzelle operates across many clouds and does not lock-in customers to any specific cloud infrastructure. Developers want to have flexibility and enterprises want to have the choice of cloud or on-premise. That is why Bluzelle also offers a Hybrid Cloud option. With hybrid, enterprises can have their own on-premise nodes that further accelerate access to their own data.Bluzelle customers are free from cloud lock-in4. Data Distributed to the EdgeMany use cases require data to be accessed very quickly or the user experience can suffer. Bluzelle has edge servers around the globe which push data very close to the user of an application. In addition to being a database, Bluzelle can be used as a super-fast edge cache compared to other databases. Currently for these use cases, the cache needs to be in the same data center as the database. As a decentralized network, Bluzelle\u2019s caching solution can be moved away from the main database and close to the actual customer.Bluzelle data is distributed to edge for performance5. Predictable and lower costingWhen using traditional cloud databases, the customer does not always know what their bill is going to be. Traditional products require the customer to know 5\u201310 parameters just to get an estimate of what their costs will be. Each parameter can be hard to measure. The customer still has many unknowns (like actual traffic charges) that are impossible to estimate, and only become known once they receive their bill.With Bluzelle everything is straight forward and is based on how much storage is required \u2014 replication, latency and traffic costs are all built in. This makes pricing lower overall with no surprises. The customer has a clear understanding of exactly what they will pay, right from the start.That is an overall review of what makes Bluzelle stand out. Next week we will go into costing and payments and show where various savings can be for customers of Bluzelle.>>> Read Next: Using Blockchain to Replace Commonly Used Internet InfrastructureUsing Blockchain to Replace Commonly used Internet ServicesTired of depending on centralized HTTP services, we found Ethereum can do the same but much more efficiently.

Then you realize that the system that\u2019s delivering this experience is using commodity hardware with cellphone screens, and can be manufactured for a low number of hundreds of dollars, and this can be in a lot of people\u2019s hands. When you think about what it takes to build a mainstream computing platform, communication is probably the most important use case and we bring a lot of experience to that.\u201dFor those of us who experienced Web 1.0 in the late 1990s, there does seem to be a bit of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu and VR could very well end up being Web 3.0 as the subtext of Zuckerberg\u2019s statement suggests. If you\u2019re still a skeptic, look no further than the fact that major brands are dipping their toes into VR, as laid out in AdAge last week: \u201cThe ad industry had started to play in the space. In September, agency Firstborn brought Brooklyn patrons of Mountain Dew\u2019s Dew Tour on a spin through Vegas skate parks, alongside pros Paul Rodriguez and Sean Malto. The following month, Havas teamed with director Patrick Sherman, of production company M ss ng P eces, and VR pioneer Felix & Paul Studios to bring the Most Interesting Man in the World\u2019s home to life for Dos Equis\u2019 annual \u201cMasquerade\u201d event.\u201d The same AdAge piece summarizes the signs that VR is going have an exciting year in 2015: \u201cbefore you start dismissing virtual reality as the stuff of gamer nerds, or the next Second Life, think again.

We\u2019re working on apps for VR,\u201d he said to Re/codesenior editor Peter Kafka. \u201cHave you used some of the film demos inside of VR?\u201d Cox continued. He cited an example in which the headset wearer envisions being inside a Blue Angel fighter jet, and another VR experience that sets the viewer inside a yurt in Mongolia. \u201cYou realize, when you\u2019re in it, that you\u2019re looking at the future, and it\u2019s going to be awesome. When you\u2019re in Facebook, you\u2019re just sending around these bits of experience \u2014 a photo, a video, a thought,\u201d Cox said, whereas with VR, you could be \u201csending a fuller picture.\u201d \u201cSo will people be able to make virtual-reality content?\u201d Kafka asked. \u201cTotally. You\u2019ll do it, Beyonc\u00e9 will do it,\u201d Cox replied.\u201dphoto credit: Asa Malthat, Re/CodeWednesday, Hollywood and VR continued its honeymoon: via Deadline: \u201cLionsgate says that Insurgent \u2014 Shatter Reality will work on the Samsung Gear VR. It will run four-minutes and offer audiences \u201ca fully-immersive, 360\u00b0 narrative experience\u201d based on the upcoming Divergent Series: Insurgent, including actors Kate Winslet, Miles Teller and Mekhi Phifer. Lionsgate\u2019s film will be in theaters on March 20. The companies will take the VR experience on tour beginning February 27 to New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Austin and San Francisco. \u201dalso on Wednesday, French startup Catopsys reached its $100K goal for its Immersis product, summed by Wired as \u201ca cross between the Pixar lamp\u2019s evil twin and a tripod from the War of the Worlds. Its single fish-eye lens beams a 180 degree VR experience into an interior space. Instead of a pair of small, stereoscopic images, your entire field of view is filled with immersive scenes from a virtual world.\u201dIn my opinion, the next logical steps for VR are much the same as they were for emerging media in previous cycles eg in the late 1990s for Web 1.0 and in the 2007\u201310 social media phase:solidifying the creative tools that will allow the VR medium to flourish by empowering creators. JauntVR and others are working on these tools, from 360 video capture to post-production.going from the current experimentation phase to the full-on \u201cit\u2019s business\u201d phase by combining brand investment, creative experiments and consumer education.I\u2019ve written about VR in 3 previous posts you can find here.My friend Leigh Ferreira and I are embarking on a State of The Union of VR for which we\u2019ll be reaching out and meeting the individuals and companies pushing back these boundaries.If you\u2019re of them, please reach out via twitter, linkedin or email (vrspotting@gmail.com)", "responses": 1, "tags": []}, {"title": "Blockchain Explained: How Web 3.0 Will Create New Business Models", "post_link": "https://media.consensys.net/episode-4-what-is-web-3-0-and-how-can-it-create-new-business-models-d07bc2e91041?source=search_post", "author_name": "ConsenSys", "author_link": "https://media.consensys.net/@ConsenSys", "publish_date": "2019-03-05", "last_modified_date": "2019-03-28", "readtime": "1.84", "claps": 41, "voters": 10, "content": "Blockchain Explained: How Web 3.0 Will Create New Business ModelsWatch the new episode in the Blockchain Explained series, where Joe Lubin explains his vision for the decentralized movement.ConsenSysFollowMar 5 \u00b7 2 min readIn this eight-part series the Co-founder of Ethereum, Joseph Lubin talks about key concepts in blockchain technology, Ethereum, and ConsenSys.

They are really just dumb state ledgers that, at best, hold basic applications... they are the modern equivalent of floppy disks, effectively useless without the computing power around them.Decentralized zealots will disagree, but rather universally, blockchains are too slow to do any computing that is really interesting aside from their one redeeming feature: they maintain \u201cstate\u201d incredibly well. In fact, they are probably the best \u201cstate machine\u201d invented to date \u2014 properly aligning the incentives to coordinate a network of machines distributed globally that maintain this state of truth without an intermediary.It\u2019s precisely this feature of \u201cstatefulness\u201d that makes blockchains powerful, but here is the rub, they can\u2019t do that much in the real world \u2014 they just don\u2019t have enough compute (today and for the perceivable future) to get interesting things done in the same way we think of pervasive cloud computing and IoT enabled things today. But it doesn\u2019t have to be this way: we can connect cloud infrastructure to blockchains to make them truly useful and enable unprecedented levels of coordination and automation in the real world around us.Having a blockchain that interacts with traditional cloud infrastructure feels like a BIG BANG event in cloud computing, a strangely symbiotic relationship that makes the other better and more useful.This is the sci-fi stuff of dreams folks, peanut butter and jelly good. Yin to yang. Copy to paste. A match made in heaven. Interestingly enough, each of the two technologies has emerged slowly across the last few years, but today, they\u2019ve both rightly come into their own, but it\u2019s time to start bringing them together to unlock the magic they can bring in concert with one another.Today, we basically have a bunch of \u201cdumb\u201d programs stored on blockchains that maintain their state forever using a global computer, and a bunch of \u201csmart\u201d programs that are stateless and only spun up to drive scalable real action using today\u2019s cloud infrastructure.Getting these two technologies working together is incredibly important, as it opens up a whole new aperture of real world \u201cprogrammatic automation\u201d that was not previously possible.Ok, let me break that down.And yes, it\u2019s going to get a bit technical, but stay with me\u2026 the basic logic looks something like this. Take one thing (like peanut butter or blockchains), and add in something entirely unrelated (like jelly or serverless cloud infrastructure), and occasionally you get something amazing. For the math buffs out there, here is the QED proof:The Stateful Machine (Blockchain): a \u201cblockchain\u201d is a stateful ledger of ownership that is recorded in \u201cwallets\u201d that basically say \u201cwho owns what\u201d at any point in time since creation. Changes in state, or transactions, are recorded as new blocks that are added to the blockchain through a process of finding consensus on \u201cwho owns what\u201d called mining (I\u2019ll let you go down that fun rabbit hole elsewhere!). The \u201cwho\u201d can be anything, including a person\u2019s wallet, a connected car on the internet-of-thing\u2019s wallet (yes, cars now have wallets and even addressable IDs!), or even a program called a smart contract that lives on the blockchain.In short, most blockchains can be thought of as a \u201cstateful-machine\u201d but currently struggle to do the heavy computational tasks required by modern cloud applications, such as running a program that can lock a car. This is where serverless technologies come in, a perfect complement, as a \u201cstateless-machine\u201d that is great at everything except maintaining state that blockchains are really really good at!A match made in heaven right?!The Stateless Machine (Serverless Cloud Infrastructure): a \u201cserverless\u201d function is a powerful new paradigm in cloud computing that abstracts away everything required to run an application except the business logic itself. No racks of servers or containers you have to manage and wrangle with (although to be clear, they can coordinate these things). As such, serverless, or functions-as-a-service (\u201cFaaS\u201d) are often used as the glue between services in a cloud environment. Ephemeral, scalable, cheap at low utilization. They provide the perfect solution to event-driven computing needs like the previous example that requires coordinating with the internet of things or blockchains.In short, if you have the code and can pay for the execution, you can have a supercomputer run a function without dealing with managing the infrastructure itself. Praise the cloud gods! \ud83d\ude4fWhile a simplification, you have scalable ephemeral compute that can be triggered to run with external events, such as changes in blockchain\u2019s state, but maintains very-little state itself. It spins up, and spins down based on need \u2014 it\u2019s a \u201cstateless\u201d machine.Tying these two together is a powerful thing.Let\u2019s see how it all comes together with an example, that may feel a little sci-fi, but it entirely possible today by combining these two technologies.Imagine the following scenario: your car is IoT enabled, and you\u2019ve taken a loan to purchase it that is now stored on a blockchain, and you\u2019ve just missed a payment\u2026\u201cYou missed your car payment and the vehicle is locked. Please reload your car\u2019s wallet.\u201d -Your CarWithin milliseconds of you lapsing on your car loan, your car has shut you out! This is the power of stateful smart contracts that can take action in the real world with serverless cloud infrastructure that trigger actions on connected devices.The loan stored is stored in a stateful contract on the blockchain that has now been paired with the automation of today\u2019s connected cloud.These are use cases we previously thought were unimaginable that combine fluid value exchange and intermediary free programmatic automation.Without any human intervention, your car was locked in no time at all \u2014 executed without an intermediary, just the blockchain and a few cloud functions that had the authority and payment to execute.Going deeper into how this might actually work, using the above car example: Let\u2019s say the car loan sat in a \u201csmart contract\u201d on the blockchain, that monitored the state of the car\u2019s \u201cwallet.\u201d Without any help, the blockchain knew this month that the loan recipient had not met the terms of the loan contract and was in default on the car loan, all without any middle person. The exact terms in the legal smart contract might look something like the following (admittedly poorly written) pseudo-code:The car payment hadn\u2019t paid-or-posted to the car\u2019s wallet. The state of affairs was provable on the blockchain by the loan provider, and the car was automatically locked. The locking was executed by a serverless function and was paid for by the escrow wallet set aside in the contract. Internet-of-things compute wasn\u2019t free, but it was cheap.Now, why was this not possible before? Because we didn\u2019t have a stateful machine to record the conditional contracts that could self-execute (a blockchain), and a stateless machine (a serverless function and it\u2019s enabling cloud infrastructure) that could actually get the real world actions done.Only using both technologies could a a smart contract on the blockchain (\u201con-chain\u201d) send payment to run a function and create a computing action in the real world (\u201coff-chain\u201d) with serverless functions that activate and authenticate to the enabling infrastructure such as a car.That\u2019s why I think the combination of stateful blockchains and stateless cloud infrastructure is a peanut butter to the jelly level good combination. One without the other is meh, but together, they are a match made in heaven.All considered, it\u2019s exciting to see the cloud being rewired in the best possible way, with specialization based on statefulness, or lack of it. All of the benefits of the decentralized middle-person-free applications (blockchain enabled applications, or \u201cdApps\u201d) can be combined with infinitely scalable computing (serverless functions-as-a-service, or \u201cFaaS\u201d) and it\u2019s just about to get interesting.The two machines: a stateful one, managed by decentralized blockchains, and a stateless one, managed by currently-centralized serverless cloud infrastructure providers is an exciting combination to watch, and I\u2019m excited to see where it goes. I\u2019m even more excited to see what entrepreneurs will build with around these ideas!If you\u2019re building something great and can build on this (or vastly disagree with it) \u2014 Get in touch with us at @RichDulude and @UnderscoreVC.Thanks for reading!", "responses": 2, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Cloud Computing", "Smart Contracts", "Serverless", "Venture Capital"]}, {"title": "Web 3.0 Economy: It\u2019s Bringing Back Bartering", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@apollocurrency/web-3-0-economy-its-bringing-back-bartering-e103f246de7d?source=search_post", "author_name": "Apollo Foundation", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@apollocurrency", "publish_date": "2018-12-23", "last_modified_date": "2019-02-16", "readtime": "3.11", "claps": 124, "voters": 8, "content": "Web 3.0 Economy: It\u2019s Bringing Back BarteringApollo FoundationFollowDec 23, 2018 \u00b7 4 min readby Marvin DumontWith bartering, the past has returned. With tokens, the future has arrived.Distributed ledger technology (DLT) is ushering a new era of trade: Blockchain databases are enabling the barter of goods and services. People can tokenize their possessions and get value: real estate, gold, diamonds, intellectual property.Fungible (commodity) and non-fungible (unique) assets can partially replace fiat currencies, and tokenized properties can be exchanged for value anywhere that has access to internet.Will cash be replaced? No. But technology is giving consumers payment alternatives.Paper bills are an obsolescing instrument.Sovereign fiats are valued at floating exchange rates against each other. However, these unbacked notes are like floating balloons. Their \u201cvalue\u201d is misleading in that exchange rate for a Japanese yen fluctuates against U.S. dollar and others. The root problem is this: These \u201cballoons\u201d aren\u2019t tied to underlying assets. Thus, what\u2019s the rationale for their economic value?Gold\u2019s value is reliable, and therefore it\u2019s a great store of value and medium of exchange. Long after we die, our descendants will continue to find the rare, shiny metal as extremely attractive. Tokenized gold (or silver or diamonds) are arguably better payment options than a highly risky U.S. dollar \u2014 which many pundits say will soon crash.Bartering is back and it\u2019s in digital form.The floating exchange rates (of sovereign fiats) are fluff, and it features the buoyancy of make-believe economics. What\u2019s the \u201cvalue\u201d of something that\u2019s literally printed out of thin air? What you have are printed cash that are backed by the \u201cfull faith and credit\u201d of a government steeped in $21.5 trillion in debt, and which does not control the national currency supply. (The private Federal Reserve does.)Commodity money is not the same as fiat cash: The latter is currency derived from paper-cash-printing operation. While commodity money (like gold and silver) have sustainable, long-term buying power.Our ancestors may be considered primitive but they seemed wise in terms of recognizing what money is. Our forefathers always cultivated, collected, and built real assets. Things that were extremely useful in daily life: grains, fish, bananas, spears, goat\u2019s milk, leather.Fast forward to today and commodity and non-fungible (non-replaceable) assets can be tokenized so you can buy and sell other assets. This is the revolution of Web 3.0 economy.Cash may not be as real as you\u2019d expect. Ask any Venezuelan who holds bolivars or Turkish citizen who holds liras. In these countries (and others), you\u2019ll discover multi-millionaires who are hungry and homeless \u2014 who hold currency whose value matches the ethics of trusted third parties.Quote:\u201cYou will never know how much it has cost my generation to preserve your freedom. I hope you will make a good use of it.\u201d \u2014 John AdamsApollo UpdatesApollo is the first all-in-one cryptocurrency that combines all mainstream features into a truly private and unregulatable platform. In Dec. 2018, Apollo launched Olympus Protocol 2.0 which makes APL the most private crypto in the industry.By Q1 2019 the foundation will release Hermes V.2.0. This new version will introduce Apollo Sharding which will enable the APL blockchain to exceed its current settlement time of 1\u20132 seconds. (APL is faster than Ripple\u2019s 4 seconds.) At 1\u20132 seconds, APL is one of the fastest cryptos in the planet.Blockchain Sharding involves splitting the blockchain into segments. This approach has positive effects on volume of transactions, download speed, blockchain speed, and overall stability of ecosystem. Sharding processes a transaction in different parts, and these are confirmed by nodes much faster when compared to conventional processes. This innovation will make Apollo blockchain faster and more secure.Another key feature of Hermes 2.0 is Adaptive Block Generation which was released ahead of schedule in Dec. 2018. It refers to creating blocks only in the presence of transactions. A transaction can settle faster by controlling the volume of data stored in the block and by creating a new type of prioritized transaction called \u201cguaranteed transactions.\u201dFor updates, follow Apollo on Twitter.

manifested to make it easy to build truly decentralized applications.The Embark WebsiteFrom the docs, here\u2019s a bit more on Embark.Embark is a fast, simple and powerful framework to develop and deploy Decentralized Applications (DApps).Embark currently integrates with EVM blockchains (Ethereum), Decentralized Storages (IPFS), and Decentralized communication platforms (Whisper and Orbit).As a dApp, Gitcoin is excited for the future Embark represents for the Ethereum ecosystem. By making it easier to interact with all facets of the Web 3 stack, we can work towards building a future which provides more security and consistency.A Status + Gitcoin Bounty ProgramWe\u2019re equally excited for the opportunity to help build the Embark framework via Gitcoin. We\u2019ll be posting 60 bounties on the development of the Embark framework through September and October! These will be easily found on our Issue Explorer, which contains a range of issues to tackle across open source projects.Issue ExplorerGitcoin is the easiest way to monetize or incentivize work in Open Source Software.gitcoin.coWe\u2019re hopeful that the Gitcoin community is as interested in building this framework as we are; it\u2019s a key part of our shared ability to build Web 3.Furthermore, Status\u2019s willingness to build Embark with us means a great deal. We have great respect for the work they\u2019ve done in the Ethereum bounties space with Status Open Bounty, and it means a lot that they see Gitcoin as a community where they can pass the torch for us to continue the mission to create an equitable future of open source work.We\u2019re impressed with the ability from the Status team like Andy Tudhope and Jarrad Hope \u2014 they have a rare combination of big-picture thinking (drawing from wide-ranging subjects including language) and focused execution.

O problema \u00e9 que a nova vers\u00e3o web ainda n\u00e3o est\u00e1 completa e a falta de alguns recursos me levou a buscar alternativas, que compartilho com voc\u00ea no v\u00eddeo de hoje.1. Simulando PilhasConforme expliquei em v\u00eddeo recente, uso Pilhas na \u00c1rea de Atalhos para trabalhar com Kanban no meu Evernote. Mas, por alguma raz\u00e3o que desconhe\u00e7o, as Pilhas criadas no computador ou telefones e tablets, n\u00e3o aparecem na nova vers\u00e3o web do aplicativo. A solu\u00e7\u00e3o que encontrei foi a cria\u00e7\u00e3o de pastas na \u00e1rea de atalhos (bookmarks) do navegador Chrome e dentro das pastas h\u00e1 links para os cadernos do Evernote Web. Se estiver complicado visualizar, sugiro que assista o v\u00eddeo abaixo.Aproveitando a ideia, criei tamb\u00e9m atalhos para cadernos espec\u00edficos como o Reuni\u00f5es, que sempre uso para anota\u00e7\u00f5es em reuni\u00f5es, apresenta\u00e7\u00f5es, workshops etc.2. Janelas para NotasOutra pratica que precisei reinventar foram as janelas exclusivas para notas que uso muito, especialmente quando estou com meus aluno nas sess\u00f5es de mentoria.No computador (Mac ou Windows) \u00e9 poss\u00edvel clicar duas vezes sobre o t\u00edtulo de uma nota e ela ser\u00e1 aberta em uma janela independente que pode ser redimensionada e posicionada em qualquer parte da tela. Infelizmente essa fun\u00e7\u00e3o n\u00e3o existe na vers\u00e3o web do Evernote, mas podemos abrir quantas inst\u00e2ncias quisermos do aplicativo em diferentes abas do navegador.O que tenho feito \u00e9 abrir uma nota em uma nova aba do Chrome e depois clico nas setas que est\u00e3o no canto superior esquerdo da nota para que ela ocupe a tela inteira da aba. Depois basta separar a aba, redimension\u00e1-la e posicion\u00e1-la em qualquer parte da tela.3. Recortar e RabiscarNo Mac eu ainda tinha o App Skitch instalado. H\u00e1 alguns anos ele foi adquirido e integrado ao Evernote. O fato de ter ele como servi\u00e7o independente me ajudava bastante na coleta de imagens para esclarecer d\u00favidas dos meus alunos. Felizmente todas as fun\u00e7\u00f5es dele est\u00e3o tamb\u00e9m dispon\u00edveis no Web Clipper e foi s\u00f3 uma quest\u00e3o de criar o h\u00e1bito de usar o recuso para coletar e rabiscar online em partes de telas do Trello, Evernote, Zapier etc.Mais DicasVoc\u00ea usa a vers\u00e3o web do Evernote?

I\u2019ve had my own involvement in this momentous date in history with being part of the WorldWideWeb restoration team at CERN last month, and having returned from the #Web30 event yesterday (both at CERN and at the London Science Museum), I thought it fitting to pay tribute on my blog too.Because of the web\u2026I have a career that I have complete control of, met many amazing people, and have dear friends whom I\u2019ve come to love, access to a seemingly unlimited wealth of knowledge, had my ideas and views challenged and been able to grow (healthily) as a member of society and finally: a place to express myself.The web not simply connect documents, but, for me, it connects people.My first webI started university in 1997 and all students were given a unix home directory. I think it only towards the end of term (in 1998) that I realised that the home directory was also mapped to a URL on the web.So technically, my first home was:http://infosys.kingston.ac.uk/~K974592/I spent summer \u201998 working on adapting one of my lecturers\u2019 Java Applets that showed a map of the borough of Kingston, turning it into a dancing stick animationI also had an Angelfire page (somehow missing the memo about GeoCities being cool). I can\u2019t for the life of me remember the username (or even URL structure) so I can\u2019t find an archive copy \u2014 though god knows what lies in wait (I suspect it might have been jedifish).My first web siteOnward to 1999, and thanks to LineOne (later swallowed by BT and later still swallowed up entirely), I had a full web site. A URL I could call home (I\u2019m not ready to share this yet, there\u2019s some content that isn\u2019t ready to be reanimated in 2019).I remember buying an Intel 385 (I think) from the local computer fair for \u00a350 (a pretty huge amount for a student).It was a Sunday, which meant that to get a browser on the machine, I\u2019d have to wait until Monday when the newsagent would open, and I could buy a PC magazine that would hopefully include a floppy disk with Internet Explorer 3.My first web site was coded using partly notepad.exe and partly my own tool I\u2019d written in 1996 (aptly named) HTML Writer v4.You can marvel at my VBScript and JavaScript combo that made a DHTML filter run (like spotlights on at a hollywood movie) (admittedly this was added for IE4 which I must have upgraded to at some point):<script language=\"VBScript\"><!--Sub Window_OnLoad()    call logo.filters.item(0).Apply()    logo.style.visibility=\"\"    call logo.filters.item(0).Play()End Sub--></script><script language=\"JavaScript\">    var x=200;    var y=110;    var direction=0;    window.onload = setlights;    function setlights()    {        litlogo.filters[0].clear();        litlogo.filters[0].addcone(440,250,05,200,110,250,250,250,60,10);        litlogo.filters[0].addAmbient(60,60,60,100);        setTimeout ( \"MoveItNow()\", 10 );    }    function MoveItNow()    {        if(direction==1)        {            x = x-5;            y = y+2.5;            if (y==150)                {direction=0;}        }        else        {            x = x+5;            y = y-2.5;            if (x==300)                {direction=1;}        }        litlogo.filters[0].movelight(0,x,y,15,1);        setTimeout ( \"MoveItNow()\",50 );    }</script></head><body><center>  <div id=\"litlogo\" style=\"WIDTH:280;HEIGHT:144; visibility:visible; filter:light(enabled=1);\">    <dd><img id=\"logo\" src=\"/img/Sharq_sm.jpg\" style=\"filter:revealTrans(Duration=3.0, Transition=12);VISIBILITY:hidden\" alt=\"Sharq Banner\"></dd></div></center><hr width=\"90%\"></body></html>\u2026and no, I\u2019ve no idea what the <dd> is doing around the <img> element\u2026!Web 2.0 and meAs part of my university course I was to do a year industrial placement. By some fluke my lecturer visited a company (that already had a placed student the year above me) and recommended the company get in touch with me.I was invited to an interview, and although apparently I hadn\u2019t impressed the boss during the process, there was something I commented on right at the end that landed me the job.That job was working for a digital consultancy called Gallio (apparently named after a drink\u2026). It was a tiny team that usually hovered around 4 people. The boss, Mark, would mentor me in all aspects of business development. He is probably responsible for the developer and my entrepreneurial skills (or desires) I have and am today.The entire business was about the web and we exploded through the Web 2.0 era and came out the other side healthy whilst our competitors were supernova\u2019ing all around us.My long lasting domain come from this era: https://ihatemusic.com (registered in 1999 and put to purpose in 2002).I registered a number of domains over the early 2000s, some of which I still have, it was a time of ideas and the web was an exciting place to be part of.OnwardsHome now is remysharp.com (where you\u2019re possibly reading this). It has been since 2006 and I hope to keep the URL and links working for many many years to come.Most of my livelihood today comes from the web. Both in how people find my business and the business that I produce.The conference that Julie and I run, ffconf, is outside of the web but exists because of the web and exists to serve the web.This year, 2019, I was able to give something back to the web in our team work at CERN and the WorldWideWeb simulator and lifetime experience, again, down to the existence of the web.So thank you Sir Tim Berners-Lee. Thank you to the satellite of people who help to realise the web. Thank you to the links that you have created and on occasion connected to me.Cheers to the web. Cheers to working on bringing the other half of the world to the web.

In the future we may also reach a point where API will not be used only by applications but also potentially by people, of course not directly but thru some UI which will allow everyone to personalize their customer experience 100%.This however is not really what API 2.0 should be, as it will mostly be a cosmetic change, a way to fully customize UI.The assumption behind the idea of API is that API is an extension of the application to allow a more flexible use of the application.However in the context of a decentralized Internet the idea of API can be pushed much more far.It\u2019s possible to basically turn the whole thing on its head making the API the core component of the application and the application itself simply an extension of that.With the introduction of the Internet, computers (I\u2019m referring to client computers and not servers) have transitioned from machines designed for storage of structured data to machines used mostly for communication. The communication part has become the core element of the user experience whereas applications like storing address books, documents, pictures now completely rotate around the communication aspect.Since communication has become so important and the application itself is now nothing more but a preferred way to browse the communication the main priority should be allowing that communication to run as smoothly as possible.As the communication becomes more important its structure becomes more and more rigid and standardized whereas the application becomes more and more flexible in the way it presents the information to the user. Once you have information as your most important element you actually want your protocol to be as rigidly defined as possible so that any possible application can interact with it. It becomes a world where the applications may change and have a lifecycle for example when they die out to competition but the protocol should not change as it should allow for this evolution and competition of applications. This is a completely different framework than what we are using now where the applications define the protocol and the API is based on on the needs and the structure of the application itself.The idea of API 2.0 is an idea of \u201cAPI First\u201d. That is 1st the protocol must be defined and then the applications should be designed and compete with each other.Of course this requires the use of a block chain as a central point of exchange for all those applications using the same API. There is however an issue with that which is the problem of competing implementations in the world of block chain. As we have seen already running competing implementations creates a significant risk of hard forks (potentially even just because of a bug) which could lead to a split of the network.In this explanation we are not trying to use block chain for the sake of using block chain (something that has become very popular). If you want multiple applications to communicate through API in a model where the protocol comes 1st and the application 2nd you certainly cannot have applications directly communicate with each other as this will lead to specific applications becoming hubs and be able to modify the protocol based on their agenda.Something similar has happened previously in the world of web browsers. Some browsers have implemented things in specific ways instead of others and the market share of the browser is going to determine which changes are going to be adopted and which ones are going to be discarded. This of course is not the ideal way to define standards or protocols as it concentrates and centralizes the decision power in the hands of a few agents.The block chain is then needed as the central place for exchange of information just like for example in the financial world some stock will be traded on the NASDAQ which would be the place of reference where the trade happens regardless of how the trader is going to experience the operation (through his broker over the phone, with some application, on some webpage, with some script using an API, etc.). In that world there is no way some broker can make changes to the protocol just because he wishes so. The NASDAQ is the official exchange where every trade has to happen. In that sense for the API 2.0 idea you want something similar but of course decentralized which will be then be based on block chain.Since because of competing implementations you cannot trust the players to simply create and maintain their own block chain because of the risk of hard forks you need some solution that will allow to build a decentralized block chain that should run on a decentralized framework.This is basically what the Polkadot project is trying to do: Create a decentralized bedrock on which block chains can be built and maintained without trusting that the clients that are going to access this block chain should be able to ensure the integrity of that block chain (from a consensus mechanism point of view but also to mitigate the risk of heart forks derived from small differences or bugs in competing client implementations)All applications which are communication centric (most of them nowadays) will then be able to \u201csettle\u201d their communications on the block chain and interact with each other through the block chain.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Bitcoin", "Ethereum"]}, {"title": "Unleashing the Web: 3 Things I Learned at FITC Web Unleashed", "post_link": "https://medium.com/tribalscale/unleash-the-web-ea8af5b30d97?source=search_post", "author_name": "TribalScale Inc.", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@tribalscale", "publish_date": "2016-10-11", "last_modified_date": "2018-05-03", "readtime": "3.06", "claps": 17, "voters": 4, "content": "Unleashing the Web: 3 Things I Learned at FITC Web UnleashedTribalScale Inc.FollowOct 11, 2016 \u00b7 4 min readBy Anoop MadhavanIf you are new to Toronto\u2019s tech community like myself, you\u2019ll soon realize that although it is small, it\u2019s very vibrant and active. Last week, on behalf of TribalScale, I participated in the 2-day Web Unleashed Conference targeted at Front-end and Full-stack engineers. It was a great opportunity to network with like-minded techies and learn about a variety of topics. Some of the topics that were covered included the W3C speech APIs, what\u2019s new with the HTTP/2 protocol, how React works and its benefits, building Node Microservices with Docker and Swarm, and the list goes on. For the purposes of this blog, I\u2019ll only be discussing and recapping three of those topics.W3C Speech APIThe W3C Speech API Community Group published the Web Speech API specification, and at the event we got a detailed presentation on how it actually works. The APIs support speech recognition and text-to-speech features right in a web browser. Currently it\u2019s only supported by Chrome and Firefox (needs to be enabled using the media.webspeech.recognition.enable and media.webspeech.synth.enabled flags in about:config). Chrome currently supports over 70+ languages and their variants.Speech recognition and text-to-speech gives the users, especially those with barriers to traditional screen interfaces, the chance to provide and receive information from a website. It would also let users interact with a page while driving without taking their eyes off the road.Given speech is a predominant mode of communication for humans, it has a natural potential for a lot of future products, apps & IoT devices. For more information, see the annyang library! It lets you add speech recognition to your site by relying on browser speech APIs and let users interact with your web app through voice commands.What\u2019s New with HTTP/2 Protocol?We do a lot of things to improve performance of web apps and mobile applications by caching, compression, domain sharding, image optimization, minification of content, etc. It\u2019s great to see that positive performance for the end-user, network and server is taken into consideration in the HTTP/2 specifications. HTTP/2 is supported by most of the modern browsers.HTTP/2 is binary so it\u2019s more compact and efficient. Also, it only uses one connection per server, instead of one connection per file request. It also compresses the header data with HPACK algorithm. All these improvements help enhance the web app performance and user experience.How React Works and What Makes it FastEver since DOM was introduced, it was advised to avoid DOM updates as it has performance implications (it\u2019s expensive to repaint and reflow). As a result, engineers had to spend a lot of time trying to avoid large changes and stick to smaller ones. For large changes, you would have to detach DOM, make changes and then reattach, which was a painful process for many.React completely changed the dynamics and solves a lot of these problems. It uses virtual DOM diffing to identify the nodes that have changed and updates only those parts. Engineers also don\u2019t need to think much about event delegation as React listens for all events at the top level using a single event listener. Then, it maintains internal mapping to all the event handlers associated to the components, which are added or removed whenever components are mounted or unmounted.It might be the end of an era for jQuery and Backbone but with powerful tools like React and React-native, JavaScript will definitely go a very long way in the world of web and mobile!Key TakeawaysI hope to see more topics on security, and more in-depth sessions on performance and accessibility in future Web Unleashed Conferences and similar events.I would highly recommend these types of tech events to tech professionals in Toronto. It\u2019s a valuable learning experience and a great way to connect with industry leaders and professionals who share similar interests.If you still need another reason to attend, there\u2019s also an after party! This year it was hosted at SPiN by us, TribalScale! We had a great time participating at the Web Unleashed Conference from start to finish and can\u2019t wait for the next one.Anoop Madhavan is a Tech Lead at TribalScale with 13+ years of experience in software engineering and worked at companies, including PayPal, Intuit and Yahoo!Sign-up for our Newsletters to get weekly updates from us including industry events and conferences we\u2019re hosting or attending!Connect with TribalScale on Twitter & Facebook!", "responses": 0, "tags": ["React", "JavaScript", "Http2", "Thought Leadership", "Web Development"]}, {"title": "The 3 Ds of Token Design: Beyond speculation, tokens as atomic building blocks for Web 3.0", "post_link": "https://medium.com/outlier-ventures-io/the-3-ds-of-token-design-beyond-speculation-tokens-as-atomic-building-blocks-for-web-3-0-2a775024b0db?source=search_post", "author_name": "Jamie Burke", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@jamie247", "publish_date": "2018-11-13", "last_modified_date": "2018-11-14", "readtime": "3.67", "claps": 77, "voters": 4, "content": "The 3 Ds of Token Design: Beyond speculation, tokens as atomic building blocks for Web 3.0Jamie BurkeFollowNov 13, 2018 \u00b7 4 min readIt\u2019s easy to dismiss the ICO mania of 2017 as a Ponzi scheme to solicit money from unsophisticated investors. Billions of capital raised, often in advance of any tangible product, to then be traded in opaque and highly manipulated secondary markets. In that melee it is understandable why many may miss the true potential of the underlying innovation: digitally scarce assets, that can be programmed with rules to incentivise and disincentivize open source and distributed systems, shifting them from purely technical systems to socio-economic ones. Where economic activity and value is coordinated by code, and better distributed amongst all its participants not just a handful of platform monopolies. But token design needs a new framework and set of methodologies to be effective and allow for resilient and sustainable digital economies..Whilst much has been made of its speculative price, think about how the Bitcoin protocol, an economic system no one central party controls or can manipulate, has coordinated billions of capital, hardware, compute power and developer activity to optimise one function: secure p2p digital value transfer. This has led to custom-built shipping containers and data centres scattered around the world jam-packed with purpose-built micro-processors stacked back-to-back for mining. Ethereum has optimised for GPU-based mining to secure its smart contract platform, Filecoin for providing data storage capacity and Golem for providing computing capacity. Imagine what other globally distributed systems could be realised and latent value could be unlocked in what is probably the largest living experiment in distributed economic engineering.At their heart cryptographically secured tokens allow us to coordinate and optimise large networks of resources from capital to compute power and data, people, their assets and perhaps even their artificial representatives at scale, and in a decentralised manner. They allow early adopters to share in a networks economic success based on the value contributed and risk born at various stages of its cycle without even needing a bank account. Just think about the \u2018over the top\u2019 implications in emerging economies currently locked out of Silicon Valleys ecosystem.But how are these complex systems to be designed, launched and curated? Can we apply a methodology to make them more effective and more sustainable? How automated or decentralised should they be? And can people really foresee far enough into the future to \u2018programme\u2019 micro digital economies with today\u2019s assumptions? And most importantly, how do we avoid building techno-utopias that in the end turn out to resemble an exaggerated form of the highly automated and sometimes dysfunctional algorithmic high-frequency trading, and their associated flash crashes, we see in capital markets today.To continue our commitment at Outlier Ventures to what is now over 4 years of open research in blockchain I am proud to announce Eden Dhaliwal, our Head of Crypto Economics, and his brilliant team out of Toronto have released a new paper called Token Ecosystem Creation: A Strategic process to architect & engineer viable token economies which includes the 3 Ds of Token Design and a number of working tools that can be freely deployed by Token Architects looking to build entirely new token economies or optimise those that are already live.We hope this will contribute to the start of an industry-defining methodology and framework for new business models in Web 3 akin to what Lean Startup or Business Model Canvas was to Web 2, both of which have been an inspiration for our work and concepts such as \u2018Minimum Viable Utility\u2019 and \u2018Network-Market Fit\u2019. However, there is much that is new and different. For starters, Token Design requires a much more diverse set of skills and competencies because of increased complexity.So whilst the methodologies laid out in the paper have been derived from our own first-hand experience and applied research across the Outlier portfolio during their token design journeys they have not been developed in isolation. This paper is the combined effort of a multitude of people drawn from across our partner ecosystem including co-author Zeynep Gurguc of Imperial College and in collaboration with our peers (inc. Trent McConaghy and Michael Zargam to name a few). And this is just the start. It requires many more people in what will be a generational project to both reconfigure the Web as it is today and enable entirely new forms of economic activities we haven\u2019t even yet imagined.You can download the paper for free here.Disclaimer: We would like to flag that whilst the design of the paper and its content may make it look on par with the quality of a book this has not been produced with the help of a publisher. As is to be expected now it\u2019s out in the wild we have spotted a number of grammatical and spelling errors throughout. We hope to correct these over the coming weeks in an updated version.

The Theory2. The Demo3. The CodePreviouslyIn the second blog post, I showed you how the demo web app works. In this final blog post, I will explain how this demo code was built by assembling the multiple ENS related libraries.[NOTE: The library API are evolving and it will more likely become out of date fairly quickly]3. The codeBefore diving into the code, let me quickly explain various components which this demo code uses.ENS = The main smart contract repository which contains various smart contracts.DNSSEC Oracle = The smart contract that stores DNSSEC proofs.dnsproverjs = This library is in charge of extracting DNS information from DNS servers and storing the proof into the DNSSEC Oracle contract. You do not need to interact with this library directly as there is another wrapper library I will explain next.dnsregistrar = This project contains a special registrar smart contract that allows you to claim the ENS name based on the proof existing on DNSSEC Oracle as well a wrapper to the dnsprovejs library.The demo code is on my github. It\u2019s quickly built on top of Truffle react box. and I will show you the process step by step.1. Setup Truffle boxFirst thing first, you create react and unbox react components.$ mkdir react$ cd react$ truffle unbox react$ truffle migrate$ npm run startIf it\u2019s successful, you should see the stored value of 5 on the page.When I first tried, it was just showing 0. It was because I was starting up ganache on port 8545, you need to edit getWeb3.js manually to change port number.2. Install necessary npm modulesnpm install --save @ensdomains/ens @ensdomains/dnssec-oracle @ensdomains/dnsregistrar eth-ens-namehashI already explained the three libraries. eth-ens-namehashis used to hash your ENS name when looking up if your ENS entity exists.3. Create & run a migration fileYou don\u2019t need to see what this migration file does line by line as we are trying to encapsulate it, but this is what the migration does:Deploy ENS and DNSSEC contract.Deploy DNSRegistrar with ENS address, DNSSEC address, and .xyz domain name.Set .xyz as a top level domain (TLD) of ENS contract.Set algorithm and digest to DNSSEC contract for verifying signature.Once the migration file is created, run truffle migrate.4. Write frontend codeI modified Truffle box default App.js. Looks like it\u2019s doing a lot but the gist of the code is not a lot.4.1 Instantiate DNSRegistrarjsregistrarjs = new DNSRegistrarJS(  this.state.web3.currentProvider, registrar.address);DNSRegistrarJS is a very thin wrapper of DNSRegistrar contract and dnsprovejs js libray. It requires your web3 provider and DNS registrar address (given that you run the migration, you can access the address via DNSRegistrar truffle function call.4.2 call registrarjs.claim()This function looks up DNS server for the given domain name and returns an claim object with found attribute.return registrarjs.claim(this.state.domain);if the domain name prefixed with _ens.contains a record, the found attribute returns true.4.3 claim.submit()By calling the function, it will send two transactions, one to call DNSSEC#submitRRSets that submits the proof and another transaction to call DNSRegistrar#claim that sets ownership on ENS.4.4 Bonus: claim.oracle.knownProof() to check if the oracle has the proofIf you want to get more info about the detail of DNS record or proofs of DNSSEC Oracle, the claim object returns a few more attributes exposing the guts of dnsprovejs API.// Iterate each DNSSEC Proofclaim.result.proofs.map((proof, index)=>{  // Ask DNSSEC Oracle if the proof exists.  claim.oracle.knownProof(proof).then((proven)=>{    // Do something with the response  })})(NOTE, this is exposed more for debugging purpose and we may exclude in the future release.)Once frontend code is created, run npm run start which should open browser pointing to localhost:3000.TODOIt\u2019s a super breeding edge version and it is highly likely that many things are missing/broken (so it\u2019s only for the brave). These are the outstanding tasks I may work on during ENS Hackathon (if I have time\u2026)Deleting a record (using NSEC record)Support for Ropsten network (once the new DNSSEC Oracle smart contract is deployed).Make migration file as a separate function so that you don\u2019t have to copy & paste each time", "responses": 1, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Ens", "Blockchain"]}, {"title": "Blockchain for Web 3.0", "post_link": "https://medium.com/remme/blockchain-for-web-3-0-a2b94582caef?source=search_post", "author_name": "Remme", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@remme", "publish_date": "2018-12-12", "last_modified_date": "2018-12-13", "readtime": "3.35", "claps": 52, "voters": 3, "content": "Blockchain for Web 3.0RemmeFollowDec 12, 2018 \u00b7 4 min readThe Web 3.0 concept was first described by Jason Calacanis and describes a new paradigm of web-site creation, content development and search engine optimization. But what is wrong with Web 2.0? Why do we need version 3.0? Just few years ago, there was big \u201chype\u201d about 2.0, but what\u2019s wrong now?The main problems of today Web are:Congestion of network resources from repeatedly duplicated content in the absence of a reliable mechanism for searching for the original source.Dispersal and disconnection makes it impossible for topic analysisDifferences in presentation depends on publishersWeak coupling of search results with the core interests of usersLow availability and weak classification of archived content ( for instance, social networks).There are several core points with old problems. One of them is that main players are not owners of information. But unlike the real world, spaces in the virtual world are not limited, which is why the number of places offering information has exceeded the number of units of unique content. Web 2.0 partially corrected the situation. Each user received his personal space (for example, an account on a social network) and the freedom to configure it. But the problem with uniqueness of content was only exacerbated by the \u201ccopy-paste\u201d technology that had an even greater degree of duplication of information.At the surface, Web 3.0 should resolve these issues and proposes a transition from a site-centered web content to a semantic-centered network \u2014 from a web page with arbitrarily configured content to a network of unique objects and combined with a finite number of clustered interconnected documents. From the technical side, there are many online services that provide a full range of tools for making, editing, searching and displaying any type of content that simultaneously provides a classification and categorization of user activity.According to requirements, Web 3.0\u2019s main responsibility includes:Track as well as index content and create smart indexing systems that should take into account not only uniqueness of content, but also the time of publishing and its original source.Track not only content but history of resource behavior (i.e. count and quality of unique materials, timeline of their production, material duplication).Provide long-term, reliable storage with access for actions noted above.The first steps in realizing these issues were made by Google in its search algorithm. There was even a service to track your content and notify the owner about duplicates. But this service was payable and didn\u2019t obtain wide recognition. Google competitors such as Bing and others also include this type of checking with different weight into search result sorting. Search systems preferred to concentrate on tracking user behavior and preferences to show more relevant results instead focusing on content and source history. It means duplicate content could rank in search engines even with unrelated content filled with ads. The other step was tracking user clicks and including a countsearch result algorithms. But website owners began to buy user clicks.There were a lot of other attempts from indexing and search systems, but the main idea lies in a necessity of complex non-fragmentary content and resource-history tracking systems with an open API. These systems should be reliable and provide integrity and availability of stored records, and blockchain could server these goals.The first solution could be , let\u2019s say, a \u201cwatch-tower\u201d embedded or connected into search indexes and tracked content as well as its characteristics. Information and metadata of each content portion (i.e. document) should be extracted, cleared and normalized before storing. In addition, technical data should be tracked including captured time, count of changes compared to previous versions, metrics of the document structure, etc. There are a lot of fields and data that could be used for rating documents in search results, but each search engine will do it its own way. We think that future Web 3.0 specifications should declare fields that should be mandatory. Also if search systems prefer to establish their own \u201cwatch-towers\u201d with dedicated and unique functions of tracking, developers should think about development of core blockchain based protocols for information sharing between such \u201ctowers.\u201dInstallation and implementation of \u201cwatch towers\u201d requires not only object-oriented (i.e. document or content-oriented) tracking but also IAM solutions with full integration into block\u0441hain based infrastructure. It means that we should track not only the content, its changes and history of resources, but also user behavior in content production to set up author authority tracking. This is one of our main goals established with REMME. With our masternodes implementation, we\u2019ve taken a huge step forward to achieve Web 3.0 goals.With REMME, you will see a semantic-centered network with decentralized indexes and tracked blockchain based storage with free and non-limited access for different systems.

Whether or not you play a significant role in shaping the environment, keeping up with the fast-paced technological changes is no small feat. Fortunately, members of the blockchain community are creating valuable resources that help alleviate this burden. Our team is on a mission to fortify these efforts by sharing the knowledge accrued as we build a foundation that allows blockchain technology to flourish.With the influx of new blockchain protocols, there have been fascinating discussions regarding different consensus mechanisms. These conversations can become quite convoluted, so we put together a small guide on the topic for those in a hurry. Let\u2019s begin!What is a Consensus Mechanism?To put it simply, a consensus mechanism is the means by which people reach agreement within a particular blockchain, specifically on the validity of transactions. In a centralized system, it is easy for people to arrive at consensus because the authority to validate truth is based in one local (central) source. In a decentralized system, this process becomes much more difficult because there are multiple sources contributing to the validation of a global truth.The Byzantine Generals ProblemIn computer science, the Byzantine Generals Problem is an abstract expression that describes how a system must cope with the failure of one of more of its components. Imagine a group of Byzantine generals surround an enemy city and they need to coordinate a plan. Unfortunately, the generals can only communicate by courier and message because they are spread too far apart. Some number of generals may want to attack the city, while some number of generals want to retreat. How do the generals reach consensus on whether to attack or retreat? If a message is sent from one general to the next, its authenticity may be at risk. Votes cast from previous generals could be corrupted by subsequent messengers or generals. The problem is that while they are in it together, the generals are independent nodes in a network whose sustainability depends on the interaction of their individual behaviors. They have equal stature among them and autonomy to make decisions. They can cooperate, disagree or betray the group. In addition, communication between them is asynchronous, increasing the time for varied interpretation, error and incomplete messaging. The solution to the problem faced by this distributed group of generals (or any decentralized network) is some form of consensus model that would enable them to recognize and agree on valid messages (the core of their ability to function at all), minimize the likelihood of faulty communication, and protect them from attacks (be they internal betrayals or external enemies), so that they can contribute individually and execute collectively on one shared mission.Modeling consensus isn\u2019t easy, and isn\u2019t a one size fits all. It is the foundation of any form of group work. How do you determine what\u2019s true? Who gets to designate valid information and on what basis? How will we communicate to maintain clarity and security of our messages? How will we protect and maintain the workings of our ecosystem, so that they satisfy the interests of the individuals comprising the group and sustain the group\u2019s overall purpose?Types of Consensus MechanismsA Proof of Work (PoW) is defined as a piece of data which is difficult (costly, time-consuming) to produce, yet easy for others to verify. Bitcoin and Ethereum utilize this type of work to reduce spam on the network and prevent double spending. It requires powerful computers, or specialized hardware, to confirm a block of transactions by solving complex mathematical puzzles in exchange for newly mined cryptocurrency and transaction fees; however, only the first machine to correctly solve the puzzle receives the reward. Although proof of work has been extremely reliable at maintaining consensus through economic incentives, the energy consumption required to confirm transactions is increasing at an alarming rate. As a result, blockchain developers are beginning to use different consensus mechanisms such as proof of stake.Instead of confirming transactions using computational power, blockchains that use Proof of Stake (PoS) rely on users providing an economic stake in the network. The stake is effectively a deposit made by users who wish to validate transactions and become eligible to collect transaction fees. In order to protect their stake, the user must only validate the transactions confirmed by majority consensus. Despite potential issues, proof of stake prevents cartel-based conduct and other centralizing behaviors. This consensus mechanism is used by Decred and will be adopted by Ethereum in the near future.Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) was introduced in 1999 in a white paper by Miguel Castro and Barbara Liskov, two computer scientists from MIT. BFT algorithms manage relationships between blockchain nodes, making the network resilient to the Byzantine Generals Problem mentioned above. These nodes are not predetermined and they join the network at will. Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerant (PBFT) systems have a predefined set of validators that are usually chosen by the protocol developers. These systems achieve a lower latency and higher file storing capabilities than the traditional BFT systems. Hyperledger and Ripple are two protocols that use a PBFT system. Federated Byzantine Agreement (FBA)was proposed in 2015 by David Mazieries and is used by Stellar. FBA\u2019s have no predefined set of validators and nodes openly choose who they trust. These trusted nodes create what are called Quorum Slices. These Quorum Slices are tallied to form the Quorum Network or the agreed upon truth of the state. These slices are later put together to form the Quorum Network.A Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a consensus mechanism that isn\u2019t used by traditional blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. DAGs are used by distributed systems such as IOTA and Byteball where transactions are validated by paying-it-forward. In order to send a transaction, users must validate two transactions. This can allow for faster transaction speed when the network is under increased load. Contrary to the traditional blockchain architecture, where blocks are mined and filled in a linear fashion, transactions take place and can be connected in different ways.The downside of using a DAG is the low threshold for malicious activity. It would take only 33% to overtake a DAG\u2019s network of vs 51% for Bitcoin which uses proof of work.Holochain uses a Distributed Hash Table (DHT). A DHT is a distributed system with a lookup service that uses (key, value) pairs. These pairs are stored in the DHT, and any participating node can retrieve the data associated with the key. The maintenance and mapping of the keys are distributed amongst the nodes.Holochain is an agent-centric model, a git-like mechanism where every node has its own version of the data (truth). Everything can be verified historically (most blockchains are data centric: everybody downloads a copy of the ledger, e.g. Bitcoin). Based on version control, every node owns a local store of the data that it can reference to a previous commit in its private space. Outside nodes don\u2019t know what is going on within external nodes\u2019 private space. To establish an external communication line and data redundancy, Holochain uses it\u2019s distributed hash table. Holochain has distributed validation rules (called DNA) that are determined not by the protocol but by application developers. How does this work without consensus? Holochain has what they call an immune system. Holochains Immune System is a gossip like system existing between applications built on top of Holochain. Applications determine independently which nodes they trust and distrust based on their own consensus rules and broadcast this out to other applications in the network. It\u2019s up to each individual application to determine which consensus rules they want to abide by. Determining consensus rules at the application layer is risky. These rules need to be well defined and if not properly executed can open up other applications to vulnerabilities.Proof of Location (PoL) ProtocolProof of Location (PoL) is a new protocol enabling location verification. Instead of node operators receiving payouts for verifying transactions like in PoW, PoL payouts are location based, meaning participants are required to visit each site in a predefined order. PoL helps prevent fake location reports (that can be easily spoofed with fake GPS apps), by using location and time stamps. Several projects using PoL include Paltin, FOAM and Sikorka.Proof of ActivityCertain cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, that are operating under the proof of work consensus mechanism have deflationary currency supplies. Questions have risen as to what will happen when these protocols reach their currency distribution limits and miners are no longer receiving the block rewards. The concern is a potential \u201ctragedy of the commons\u201d where individuals begin acting out in self interest. PoA was engineered to mitigate this security by creating a hybrid between PoW and PoS.This consensus mechanism requires miners to use PoW to generate the header of a block. Once the header is generated, the system switches over to PoS until the block is completely formed. Fees are split between those who contributed to the formation of the block. Although PoA attempts to combine the best of both worlds, criticisms often include excessive energy consumption (PoW) and the potential double signing transactions (PoS).Reaching ConsensusConsensus mechanisms are a integral to blockchain technology and other distributed systems. They are the basis on which participants of a given network with a range of varied self-interests, and even a mutual distrust for one another, can come to an agreement on the validity of data and transactions. The consensus model implemented by a project, company or team is the heart of its security, communication, and sustainability.The Byzantine Generals Problem does not have one solution. Decentralized networks, built to engage participants with autonomy to make decisions in their self-interest, while protecting and sustaining the ecosystem\u2019s continued service, are inherently complex. They seek to orchestrate the interests of the one (purpose) and the many (actors), and since there will always be diversity, growth and conflicting interests among us in any situation, this isn\u2019t a race to the finish line where we solve consensus. It\u2019s more like a wide-open door to the lab, where different lines of inquiry investigate the fundamental questions informing the mechanism design of a given project:How do you determine what\u2019s true?Who gets to designate valid information and on what basis?How will we communicate to maintain clarity and security of our messages?How will we protect and maintain the workings of our ecosystem, so that they satisfy the interests of the individuals comprising the group and sustain the group\u2019s overall purpose?What do you think?(ping us on Twitter!)Some good reads on consensus mechanisms:The Byzantine Generals\u2019 ProblemUnderstanding Blockchain Fundamentals, Part 1: Byzantine Fault ToleranceWhat is Proof of Stake?HolochainHolochain vs. HashgraphPractical Byzantine Fault ToleranceA (Short) Guide to Blockchain Consensus Protocols", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Cryptocurrency", "Technology", "Development"]}, {"title": "Taking Web 3 Mainstream \u2014 Accelerating The Convergence Economy", "post_link": "https://medium.com/outlier-ventures-io/taking-web-3-mainstream-accelerating-the-convergence-economy-29c1b144d782?source=search_post", "author_name": "Jamie Burke", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@jamie247", "publish_date": "2018-11-13", "last_modified_date": "2018-11-14", "readtime": "3.45", "claps": 24, "voters": 4, "content": "Taking Web 3 Mainstream \u2014 Accelerating The Convergence EconomyJamie BurkeFollowNov 13, 2018 \u00b7 4 min readIntroduction by Jamie BurkeHopefully by now, you are familiar with Outlier Ventures and our investments. As a venture platform with finite resources to fulfill intensive advisory work, we have so far chosen to focus on areas we believe to be most impactful and profitable: the intersections of deep technologies like AI, IoT and the Next Gen Data, enabled by tokenized and open source distributed ledger technologies. You will probably know we term this The Convergence Ecosystem. We have however (since 2015) always said this requires much more to accelerate and strengthen this vision beyond protocols to mainstream and widespread adoption.We have recently begun referring to this as The Convergence Economy which extends our investment thesis to the \u2018picks & shovels\u2019 as well as new capital markets infrastructure. It is this we wanted to share with you today to help contextualize some upcoming projects and activities we have been working on for several months.BackgroundIt has been our belief since our first paper on the subject back in 2016 that Deep Tech will increasingly reinforce one another and ultimately lead to the creation of The Convergence Ecosystem. We define this as an increasingly decentralized, automated Web that enables high degrees of operational and economic autonomy for people, agents (bots) and machines. That means both p2p in a human sense but importantly m2m (machine to machine), a2a (agent to agent) and combinations thereof.We see this existing broadly in several layers (see below) and most applicable, but by no means limited to, markets such as Industry 4.0, Health, Energy, Smart Cities and Mobility.The Convergence EconomyAs previously stated, to date our focus has been primarily on tokenized protocols that serve as foundational open source software infrastructure to The Convergence Ecosystem. While we believe this is ultimately where most of the value of Web 3.0 will reside in the long term, there are many other enabling opportunities that will be critical to the economy to go mainstream, allowing both more institutional and retail money to enter the market, but more importantly real world user adoption and \u2018network market fit\u2019 through vertical integration. We believe equity-based businesses still have a valuable role to play in this economy, both as on off ramps but also for real world, revenue generating, service based business to make the technologies usable for everyday people and enterprise.This is recently why Rumi Morales joining Outlier has been strategically important to these extended activities. Her background at Goldman Sachs and CME Ventures gives us greater depth investing in capital markets and more traditional venture companies in related Deep Tech including some of the most successful businesses that have appeared around crypto like Ripple (the company), Digital Currency Group & Digital Asset Holdings.Going deeper with Rumi MoralesAreas to Strengthen & AccelerateWith The Convergence Economy we are looking to both strengthen and accelerate the adoption of an open-source, decentralized digital economy across more traditional industries. \u201cIf you build it, they will come\u201d sounds nice but in practice digital infrastructure needs additional components to bridge to existing institutions to become more readily and widely adopted.In practical terms, this first means integrating crypto into existing markets and systems in a compliant, enforceable and secure way. For us, this includes increased attention on legal and regtech, particularly around smart contracts and inter-ledger transactions and communications. There are still gaping holes around compliance, audit, arbitration and enforcement, and without advancements in these areas, adoption of Web 3 by more institutions and people will take far longer than it should.Similarly, it means identifying the new wave of financial technologies and tokenized capital markets infrastructure to improve asset stability and liquidity in high-velocity, decentralized systems, and ultimately support autonomic economic agents. Stablecoins and decentralized exchanges are a start, but we need to see further developments in custody, trading tools, crypto on-ramps, and liquidity routing, among others, to support the greater ubiquity of protocols.A third area is greater emphasis on the T, the \u201cthings\u201d in IoT, rather than just the value transfer component of the internet. We need to focus on securely connecting hardware devices through embedded software and even network connectivity itself. On the former we have begun looking at a number of security companies that address concerns over quantum proof encryption and communication channels, and on latter we have begun to engage with a number of multinational corporations that are the gatekeepers to m2m connectivity as well as deepening our engagement with digital manufacturers and IoT innovation centers to facilitate their membership\u2019s greater engagement with crypto assets and blockchain.

William\u2019s background in blockchain includes being lead author of ERC-721 (a similar project for Ethereum), contributing to the Ethereum EIP process and Solidity language, and advising Epik, 0xcert, Arianee and EY (Nightfall project). Separately, he runs a medical education company and boudoir photo studio with his wife.The Aion NFT standard (\u201cAIP-040\u201d) is designed based on the Ethereum standard but has big differences based on studies of all the NFT applications launched up to now. NFT supports applications such as: certificates of authenticity for real-world assets, in-game collectables, and security tokens for investible assets. William\u2019s commitment to make these applications happen include ensuring Aion is usable for developers and that Aion works for the intended audience. The project\u2019s scope is:Make the NFT standard usable for all identified use cases and end usersWrite a reference implementation that follows Aion and Java best practices, including references to help developers further study best practicesIdentify and fix any gap in best practices \u2014 the path should be clear when developers want to buildWork with Aion AVM team to improve their API and support real-life development situationsReview and improve Aion security (i.e. vulnerabilities)Engage the community that cares about this spaceUpcoming events:October 7th-10th: Matt Spoke to speak at JAX London about integrating blockchain in Java applications.FinanceToken holders and the number of transactions dynamics (from Aion Explorer):Unity Staking Contracts Overview:At the heart of the Unity Consensus are the staking and stake delegation mechanisms, which are responsible for managing staker registrations and stake updates. In this article, the author walks you through the design considerations the team has made and the implementation details. The source code is available here.Design ConsiderationsIn the Unity Consensus, the team implements the staking and stake delegation mechanisms in AVM smart contracts. Such a design choice gives them two advantages:The execution and storage model of a smart contract is well defined, so it will be cost-free to ensure consensus on the stake state;The user interaction will be simple, as a user can interact with a smart contract using existing transaction infrastructure (no extra tool is required).Staker Registry ContractA staker needs to be registered in this contract before it can produce a valid PoS block. A coin-holder can vote/unvote for a registered staker and even transfer stake between two stakers.The internal structure of the staker registry is shown in the picture below. One staker registry is associated with a collection of registered stakers, pending unvotes and pending transfers. To understand the state/lifecycle of coins, the author refers readers to the Section 2.4 of the Unity Engineering Specs.Structure of the staker registry contractCoin states and state transitions from the perspective of the staker registryThe staker registry contract is privileged, in a sense that the kernel depends on it for deciding the validity of a PoS block. Despite being privileged, this contract is designed to be simple and the kernel-contract interaction is limited to just one stateless method call (a stateless method call doesn\u2019t change the state of a smart contract during execution). This method is getEffectiveStake(signingAddress, coinbaseAddress), which returns the effective stake of a block producer.Register A StakerAnyone can register a staker by calling the registerStaker method of the staker registry, which has the following parameters.identityAddress \u2014 (unique) An address used to identify a staker;managementAddress \u2014 The address of the management key used when updating the staker, e.g. updating signing address;signingAddress \u2014 (unique) The address of the key used for signing a PoS block;coinbaseAddress \u2014 The address used for receiving block rewards;selfBondAddress \u2014 The address used for calculating the self-bond stake of a staker (self-bond stake of a staker is the stake from its owner).Separating the stake of staker owner from the stake of other voters gives additional benefits and flexibility. For example, an opportunity to apply self-bond percentage requirement and min self-bond requirement.VoteVoting is the process of converting liquid coins into stake. To vote for a staker, a coin-holder needs to call the vote(staker) method, with a specific amount of coins being passed along. The coins will be in the custody of the staker registry contract after voting.UnvoteTo revoke a stake and retrieve the coins, one needs to call the unvote(staker, amount) method, which will cancel the stake, lock it for a pre-defined period of time, i.e.UNVOTE_LOCK_UP_PERIOD, and return a unique PendingUnvote ID, if the request is valid. It\u2019s only after the lock-up period that the user can really get its coins back, by calling the finalizeUnvote(id)method.Transfer StakeThe staker registry also allows a voter to transfer stake from one staker to another. This allows voters to swap stake between block producers without going through an unvote-and-vote process, which would involve the unvote lockup period.To transfer stake, one needs to call the transferStake(from, to, amount)method, which returns a PendingTransfer ID upon valid request. The user needs to call the finalizeTransfer(id) method to complete the stake transfer, after another lock-up period, i.e. TRANSFER_LOCK_UP_PERIOD.Pool Registry ContractWhile the staker registry is easy to interact with, many coin-holders would prefer to delegate their stake to a pool rather than to maintain a node and stake on their own. We call this group of people delegators. A pool receives stake from and re-distribute the block rewards to its delegators.In the Unity Consensus, a decentralized stake delegation system, as in PoolRegistry smart contract, is designed and implemented. This is made possible by the following conditions:The staker registry is a smart contract which allows the pool registry to interact with via the inter-contract CALL;An efficient reward distribution algorithm (F1 fee distribution) is proposed by Dev Ojha.Unlike staker registry, the pool registry is un-privileged and implemented purely based on the existing framework provided by AVM.Pool Registry ArchitectureAt the very front is the PoolRegistry, which is the endpoint for all pool owners and delegators. For each registered pool, the registry maintains a PoolState , which is associated with one PoolCoinbase, one PoolCustodianand one PoolRewardsManager.The PoolCoinbase is smart contract instance, in the control of the pool registry, whose only purpose is to receive block rewards;The PoolCustodian is another smart contract instance, in the control of the pool registry, which is the custodian of the pool owner\u2019s stake;The PoolRewardsManager is an internal object, which calculates the share of rewards of each delegator to a pool.Register A PoolTo register a pool, the owner needs to go through the following steps:Publish the meta data, e.g. name and description, in a JSON file at a publicly accessible URL (the scheme of the JSON file is being actively defined).Call the registerPool(signingAddress, commissionRate, metaDataUrl, metaDataContentHash) method of the pool registry, where signingAddressis the address of the signing key to be used for block production, comissionRate is the service charge in percentage that the pool owner wants to take, and metaDataUrl and metaDataContentHash are the URL and hash of the meta data respectively.After these two steps, the pool can start accepting stakes from delegators, including the pool owner itself. As long as the min self-bond stake requirement is satisfied, the pool owner can use the signing key to produce blocks and earn block rewards.An interesting implementation detail is that the registerPool method is convoluted. It creates a staker in the staker registry, instantiates a PoolCoinbase and aPoolCustodian, and configures the staker properly. This will ensure that all block rewards of the pool go to the pool registry.DelegateTo delegate stake to a pool, one just needs to call the delegate(pool)method along with some amount of AION coins to stake. The pool registry uses the received coin to stake in the staker registry.UndelegateTwo steps are required to cancel a delegation. First, the delegator needs to call the undelegate(pool, amount) method of the pool registry, which will initiate an unvote operation and return a PendingUnvote ID. Second, it has to call the finalizeUnvote(id) method to finalize it after the unvote lock-up period.WithdrawWithdrawal is the process of claiming back the block rewards one delegator has earned so far. This is being done by calling the withdraw(pool) method, which will transfer the rewards to the delegator upon a valid request. For how the contract decides the block rewards, check the F1 fee distribution scheme.Redelegation and Auto-redelegationRedelegation is the process of delegating to a pool using the earned block rewards from that pool. This is essentially a combination of withdraw and delegate.Auto-redelegation enables one delegator to allow others to redelegate its block rewards. This is implemented by introducing an auto-redelegation market. If a delegator sets an auto-redelegation rate, then anyone can call the pool registry to auto-redelegate the delegator\u2019s rewards on its behalf. The caller will get a portion of the rewards as incentives based on the auto-redelegation rate.How Do Coins Flow?Intuitively, all delegator\u2019s stake and PoS block rewards are in the custody of the Pool Registry contract; all pool owner\u2019s stake is in the custody of the Pool Custodian contract. If the coins are for delegation, then they flow to the Staker Registry.Flows of coins in the delegation systemIf you want to learn more about the details, please read the Unity Engineer Spec or the smart contract source code.RoadmapPhase 2: DenaliAion Virtual Machine (AVM) Version 1This AVM is a custom-built, lightweight, performant, and stable VM that leverages key characteristics of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), providing concurrency and robustness within a blockchain-specific context. The AVM is responsible for running applications on top of Aion. The AVM will include its own scripting language.Aion Scripting LanguageThe Aion scripting language is used for writing chain logic that runs on Aion-Everest and potentially any connecting/participating network. The Aion language is compiled into AVM bytecode and executed by the AVM. The Aion language provides the following features: Defensive programming, Blockchain runtime environment, Blockchain context injection, Security.Proof-of-Intelligence Consensus AlgorithmAn economic measure to deter denial of service attacks by requiring participants, solvers in Aion-Everest, to perform artificial intelligence (AI) computation. The intent is to motivate the creation of AI-specific or specialized hardware that could be used for machine learning and neural network training in the future.2019:Phase 3: Everest 2019Participating Network BridgingThe generic bridge protocol is designed to enable the atomic movement of value and data between heterogeneous networks. This will enable the development of cross-blockchain contract logic and free-floating token supplies.Complete Validator NominationThe Hybrid DPoS / PoI consensus mechanism aims to achieve high performance while providing a fair and decentralized validator set. This is achieved through a token staking system and partly through a novel verification algorithm based on concepts used in modern neural networks called Proof-of- Intelligence.Aion Virtual Machine (AVM) Version 2Aion release milestones:Q4: Unity Consensus (PoW/PoS hybrid)Partnerships and team membersAion joins Public Chain Technology Alliance:Now Hiring:Aion HQ (Toronto)MavenNet (Toronto)EcosystemWandX\u2019s beta DEX launched on main net.Kesem Frank to receive award from U of Toronto this October:Miami Gets Moving: Leveraging Innovation to Promote Connectivity by Velocia team.Patrick Mandic of MavenNet presents QCAD to EU\u2019s ITEA3:Aion4J Maven plugin update with built-in faucet.ERAU joins VeriTX ecosystem:VeriTX website goes live.metaMe Overview (Bicameral Ventures portfolio company):Banking on Blockchain | Why Financial Institutions Are Betting Big? by goAbstrakt.How Censorship-Resistant Digital Goods, DAOs and DEFI apps are driving a new \u2018Digitalization Era by Alessandro ML Toshi.Projects Building on Aion:MetalyfeVelociaVeriTransferWandXClan-PlayRisePicWinMinerMavenStampFifth-9.com:\u2022 SPRXS\u2022 Digital Liquidity FactoryCentrys.io:\u2022 TH\u00c9O (theoproject.io) (with Syn\u00e1 wallets)\u2022 Agora (beta.agora.theoproject.io)\u2022 Spiro (centrys.io/enterprise)Community dApps:\u2022 BondWithFriends\u2022 AionRouletteEcosystem builders:BicameralVenturesMavenNetChaionSee also Aion Connect.RumorsTwitter:Other:Check out Unity Consensus Feedback Form.CryptoDev reviews Aion development progress (Polish):Social media metricsAion Community Commitment: a few initiatives that will involve participation from everyone and enable two-way communication.Social media activity:Social media dynamics:There is a slight fluctuation in the number of subscribers of Aion social media channels.Twitter \u2014 Average number of retweets is 15\u201330 for one post.Facebook \u2014 10\u201315 likes per publication.Reddit \u2014 Threads with 2\u201310 comments.

Eisenberg: Six Kids And A Full Time JobFollowApr 27, 2015 \u00b7 6 min readWhile my first name is not Tim, (neither O\u2019reilly nor Berners Lee) I wanted to offer my own version of the next rev of the web. Commonly referred to as Web 3.0 but deserving of another, better name, Tim O\u2019Reilly and his colleagues have developed quite a conversation around semantics and ontologies that they suggest will form the foundation for Web 3.0. While I agree that ontologies and semantics will be core to machine-to-machine interaction and certainly to the web, I am less convinced that it will herald in Web 3.0. Semantics is somewhat like the Year of The Network and the Brooklyn Dodgers. It will definitely come but not \u201cnext year.\u201dIn a somewhat technical post on Web 3.0, Alex Iksold on the ReadWriteWeb blog offers this interesting suggestion for Web 3.0 (see his diagram since I am not good at graphics):\u201cThe net effect will be that unstructured information will give way to structured information \u2014 paving the road to more intelligent computing\u2026.So bringing together Open APIs (like the Amazon E-Commerce service) and scraping/mashup technologies, gives us a way to treat any web site as a web service that exposes its information. The information, or to be more exact the data, becomes open. In turn, this enables software to take advantage of this information collectively. With that, the Web truly becomes a database that can be queried and remixed.\u201dI wanted to pick up on Alex\u2019s excellent thread and offer my own view on web 3.0. I think web 3.0 will encompass 3 elements:1. Visualization2. Integration3. True Multi-PlatformVisualization \u2014 The web is still a very texty place. While web 2.0 has brought an abundance of visual media sites such as YouTube, Flickr and the like, the fundamental medium is still text based. Search and monetization are all very textual. This is true of the outer rims of the web as well, such as SMS (text messaging) and the PC desktop, where we are still married to the folder metaphor borrowed from the physical file cabinet of yesteryear. Google\u2019s ad and web navigation is completely text based. There are attempts at video ads but they are still a while off from taking hold.Web 3.0 will herald new visual expressions, visual search, and new user interfaces. Google\u2019s recent acquisition of Gapminder\u2019s Trendalyzer software is a foray in that direction. Benchmark\u2019s investment in Zlango is also a nod in this direction since icon based messaging across platforms (more on that below) is the visualization of Web 3.0 as opposed to textiness of mobile 1.0.Integration \u2014 Much like integration followed the client-server era, it will follow the web 2.0 era. Our current web application environment is more like disparate islands in a vast sea rather than an integrated web. If you look at the Web 2.0 landscape you see Islands of Social Networks, Islands of video sites, Islands of Games, Islands of Photo sites, Islands of Blogs, Islands of communication (Email and IM and VOIP). Aside from some point to point widget integration, these islands rarely interconnect. Additionally, within each island, you have communities where the neighbors do not talk to each other.This is how Sramana Mitra aptly describes the islands on her blog about Web 3.0:\u201cWeb 2.0 has been a nichy phenomenon with hundred and thousands of microcap efforts addressing one of the Cs, lately, Community being the most popular force, producing companies like MySpace, Facebook, Piczo, Xanga, and Flixster.\u201dThe perfect example is IM where open interconnect protocols have been slow to roll out but it is true of photos and videos and other content as well. I am locked into Kodak Easy share because I started there and I can\u2019t even really use my photos there ad hoc with other external services because they are not integrated. Why can\u2019t I take my purchased digital assets with me from game to game? Imagine, if I told you that if you sign up for a Verizon cell phone you could not call someone who was on Cingular? Perposterous? That is the world of IM. What if you could not take your film into any 1 hour photo store but you needed to go back to the same store or the store you bought the film from? What if I bought fancy chess pieces and I could not take them to any park chess table?We think we have open platforms such as mashups but it is a mirage. Digital assets are not portable and it is both a back end integration problem and an openness of the \u201csite\u201d creators. Semantics is, obviously, a part of the solution to this. It will enable disparate systems to talk clearly but it is the second part in my view. We need both technologies and platform openness on the individual digital asset level to accomplish this.This is also related to identity. How come I do not have integrated access to both my content and communication? Isn\u2019t that what the internet promised? From a user perspective, think of this problem as single-sign-on plus control and portability of my digital assets. But that is the front end view. Web 3.0 will bring the integration layers that enable this.Multi Platform \u2014 There has been a lot of talk about Web and Mobile experiences and the differences between them. Frankly, I think that Mobile\u2019s platform backwardness is holding this up. The balkanized operating systems and unending porting to 1000+ cell phone platforms is hampering realizing the dream of gaining two way access and usage to cloud-based assets on my mobile phone, with a good user experience (not to mention carrier closed mindedness). This is also partly a prediction on HTML and WML convergence. And, these will happen in web 3.0. There are enough start ups working on a myriad of virtualization schemes and the carriers (outside the USA) are beginning to open up. Applications will begin to emerge that offer a seamless and satisfactory experience across platforms. I look at my kids and how they use phones and the web and it is way different from how I use it. They want these experiences shared across platforms and do not understand when I tell them that mobile is still a more limited platform. Windows, BREW and java are all a nuisance for them in the same way they do not really see a need for windows on the PC. For my kids and their friends it is simple: Have browser will travel. They are even willing to have a download like they need for high quality games like WoW and RuneScape and they will download it to the phone. They want their IM buddies on their phone and texting on the PC. They want their photos and their files on their home computer and school computer without having to pack them on a necklace or key chain and take them and they want them on their phone. Basically, they want a seamless great and transferable experience in both places.This is not a visionary view of the web 3.0 world. I am not a visionary. I get two looks at trends: looking at new deals and academic work as a VC and watching and listening to my kids at home (that is actually quite a good-sized focus group these days). Teenagers already want their web more visual and they will hit the workforce soon. Startups will move to provide more visual interaction and communication. I see it coming already. They will demand integration and with the fickleness of this generation, they will find their way to open and integrate data and sites. They don\u2019t call it data. It is their digital life. They don\u2019t want to hear that it is locked in a windows file folder or that they can\u2019t move it from World of Warcraft to Runescape or from Snapfish to Flickr. And, they want it wherever they are: on the bus or in front of the PC. And guess what, they will get it soon because this is web 3.0: The Visually Integrated Web.[Originally published on 12th April 2007 by MIchael Eisenberg]", "responses": 0, "tags": []}, {"title": "Here Are Ways Regulations Harm Web 3.0 Economy", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@apollocurrency/here-are-ways-regulations-harm-web-3-0-economy-c9a818a9b600?source=search_post", "author_name": "Apollo Foundation", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@apollocurrency", "publish_date": "2019-03-20", "last_modified_date": "2019-04-09", "readtime": "2.00", "claps": 1, "voters": 1, "content": "Here Are Ways Regulations Harm Web 3.0 EconomyApollo FoundationFollowMar 20 \u00b7 3 min readby Marvin DumontApollo Foundation is building all-in-one privacy currency that combines mainstream crypto features in a private and unregulatable platform.

Because fewer Web 3.0 businesses compete with each other, innovation is stunted.Fewer regulations is a better alternative: Market competition drives lower prices and improves quality of blockchain and crypto products and services. That\u2019s because Web 3.0 businesses must serve the true boss \u2014 the customer, and not bureaucrats. An efficient marketplace is self-governing: Mediocre companies eventually go bankrupt anyway, as consumers seek better choices.In practice, there\u2019s much corruption and profiteering (by bureaucrats and lawmakers) via regulations. They protect special interests (such as traditional banks, payment processors, and wire services) at the expense of innovative (and threatening) startups. The Web 3.0 economy becomes less efficient and distorted.With quid pro quo, friends unethically (and illegally) offer bribes, political favors, campaign donations, career advancement, sexual favors, and luxury access while suppressing and obfuscating market dynamics by which economic actors are expected to abide by.We see above effects around the world. Think China, India, Venezuela, Iran, and other nations that prevent wider adoption of programmable monies.Their citizens are unable to generate wealth from an emerging industry. Their local economies are also slow to adopt innovations that disrupt obsolete ways of doing business. With resistance to (positive) change, they miss the chance to improve transparency, business practices, and payment systems.APOLLOLearn more about Apollo Foundation\u2019s privacy mission and tech breakthroughs:What Is Apollo DEX?Sharding: A Solution To Blockchain BloatApollo Mixer: A Cloaking Tool That Makes Your Money UntraceableApollo To Release Hermes Update By Q1 2019Protect Your Identity With Apollo\u2019s IP Masking 2.0Apollo: A Super Fast All-In-One CurrencyAdaptive Forging Streamlines Apollo BlockchainApollo Pushing The Boundaries Of Blockchain SpeedBitfi Wallet Integrates Apollo All-In-One Privacy CurrencySharding To Speed Up Apollo BlockchainUpdater Keeps Blockchain Functioning Smoothly", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Apollo", "Cryptocurrency", "Regulation", "Economy", "Legislation"]}, {"title": "", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@sramana/web-3-0-and-e-commerce-investment-thesis-of-3-vcs-b2949ae5965a?source=search_post", "author_name": "Sramana Mitra", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@sramana", "publish_date": "2015-04-03", "last_modified_date": "2015-04-03", "readtime": "1.33", "claps": 7, "voters": 2, "content": "Sramana MitraFollowApr 3, 2015 \u00b7 2 min readWeb 3.0 and E-Commerce Investment Thesis of 3 VCsLast fall, we had three VCs participate in our 1M/1M roundtables to discuss their Web 3.0 and e-Commerce investment thesis.

Blue Nile, by the way, is a classic case study of a true Web 3.0 company, and it was a contrarian investment thesis from Trinity to invest in the business. Find out more in the discussion below.Discussion with Jason Stoffer, Partner, MaveronMaveron is a consumer-only venture capital firm that has had a successful track record of investing in e-commerce ventures ranging from eBay, Shutterfly, Groupon to the more recent Zulily. They also invest in education ventures.In this discussion with Jason, some of the most interesting nuggets were around how the Internet has become the most cost-efficient channel to build brands (both retail and designer). We discussed some of Jason\u2019s investments in fashion and beauty, and had a particularly interesting discussion around the importance of merchandising in building such businesses.Finally, we discussed two of Jason\u2019s education investments, and his investment thesis around education overall.Discussion with Tod Francis, Shasta VenturesWe started with a discussion on the history of retail, all the way from shoe stores, to departmental stores, and back to specialty retail.

Web 1.0, as we call it now, was all about websites providing readable content which was a privilege for a few lucky ones. It also led to the birth of aboriginal Internet goliaths. Gradually, we moved on to Web 2.0- an era marked with the trend of writing, generating, and sharing content.Facebook, Twitter allowed almost everyone to share their experiences and blogging became the \u2018it\u2019 thing. Generations changed, but web 2.0 stayed. Oppressive governments were overthrown yet we unknowingly became slaves of centralized Internet authorities. Smartphones took over, and a digital age was born. Although digitization enlightened people about what they have been missing, they still had a yearning for independence.Somewhere in between, the Internet became a fundamental right ushering in a democratic digital revolution. Web 3.0 will be the age of decentralization and technologies like IoT, Blockchain, AI, VR will be the frontrunners. Blockchain singularly has come a long way over the last decade. From B-money to Bitcoin to Ethereum, Blockchain has created a whirlwind of activities across multifarious industries.The digital tamper-proof ledger is facilitating cross-border payments, maintaining health records, providing e-governance and what not. The Blockchain is optimizing lives slowly and gradually, making processes more efficient and manageable than ever before. The technology holds such promise that one cannot help but wonder how effective it will be if implemented in the aged care sector.While everyone is busy implementing blockchain for business transactions or asset management, no one thought about how it directly impacts human lives. The aged care sector has been ignored long enough. Poor support systems, lack of care homes, untrained caretakers are the exclusive features of traditional care homes not to forget the centralized authorities answerable to no one.Presently, about 962 million people age 60 or above worldwide. This number is growing at an annual rate of 3 percent. The world is on the verge of a demographic milestone. In the coming years, many of us will be joining this part of the ageing population. Who will we look to then?Luckily, blockchain technology can help make the aged care sector more efficient, reliable, fast and secure. An ecosystem that resolves present issues by seamlessly implementing blockchain technology is just what we need.Organized processes \u2014 A single platform to manage homes, services and other requirements.Vetted homes \u2014 Standardization of care homes built to the highest standards like anti-skid tiles, emergency-care switches or chamfered wall-edges.Secure \u2014 On-call doctors and emergency response systems, CCTV surveillance along with security guards.Trained caretakers \u2014 Well-trained caretakers that can be rated by the elders based on the assistance provided.Personal services \u2014 Yoga, dancing, art, cooking classes to keep the elders entertained.Health records \u2014 Health records stored on the blockchain with regular updates by doctors.Reward structure \u2014 Caretakers get rewarded according to the feedback provided by seniors thus encouraging the best personal care.Tokenization \u2014 Blockchain implies the use of a cryptocurrency at every stage, eliminating the need for fiat money.Blockchain technology is probably the only solution to bring the much-needed change in the aged care sector. The technology is already solving age-old issues in finance, trading, healthcare, governance and a well-planned adoption can efficiently provide a senior citizen-friendly system. The aging population may not seem to be that big of an issue today, but it will soon be putting a lot more pressure on government and its services.Why rely on governments when we can take the first step towards solving a major issue?

Buterin tweeted:Opera, the browser maker that recently launched its blockchain-oriented browser specifically designed for surfing and interacting with the decentralized web, is announcing a partnership with HTC to protect the identity and privacy of Exodus 1 users. Charles Hamel, Head of Crypto at Opera, said:\u201cWe are at the dawn of a new generation of the Web, one where new decentralized services will challenge the status quo. HTC and Opera have both made the bold decision to be the first to step up and enable this transformation. We are very proud to partner with EXODUS and together define a new standard for usability and security of crypto.\u201dOther blockchain phones mentioned by MIT Technology Review include the recently launched Samsung Galaxy S10 (see this CNET review), which offers private key storage for blockchain-enabled mobile services, the recently launched Finney phone by Sirin Labs, and the cheaper Electroneum, an $80 Android phone that can mine cryptocurrency.By allowing users to own their identity and data, blockchain technology can be an important enabler for a decentralized internet, but only if packaged in a way that is easy to use. It can be argued that the main obstacle to the mass adoption of both blockchain-based and decentralized Web 3.0 applications is the fact that user interfaces are not yet as easy, immediate, and intuitive as they should be for mass appeal.Smartphones have achieved popularity by offering super-simple one-click user experiences to masses of users, including computer-illiterate ones. It seems likely that simple phone-based, blockchain-powered decentralized applications could open the Web 3.0 to the masses.

Ensuite parce qu\u2019elle fait souvent participer de nombreux intervenants de culture diff\u00e9rente, aux int\u00e9r\u00eats parfois divergents au sein d\u2019une m\u00eame structure. Enfin parce qu\u2019elle r\u00e9pond souvent \u00e0 des imp\u00e9ratifs ext\u00e9rieurs qui la rendent difficile, sinon impossible \u00e0 planifier.Apr\u00e8s confier la maintenance de ses projets web et Les cycles de maintenance collective, ce troisi\u00e8me volet de notre s\u00e9rie sur la mise maintenance des projets web vous invite \u00e0 vous int\u00e9resser \u00e0 la maintenance \u00e9volutive.La maintenance \u00e9volutive ?Expliquer la notion de maintenance \u00e9volutive \u00e0 quelqu\u2019un qui ne conna\u00eet pas le cycle de vie d\u2019un projet web revient souvent \u00e0 poser pour la premi\u00e8re fois ce classique des devinettes surr\u00e9alistes :Quelle est la diff\u00e9rence entre un canard ?Il a les deux pattes pareilles surtout la gauche.La maintenance \u00e9volutive est donc l\u2019ensemble des \u00e9volutions \u2014 logique jusqu\u2019ici \u2014 apport\u00e9es \u00e0 un projet web en dehors de son cycle de d\u00e9veloppement. En gros, on fait \u00e9voluer, mais en dehors du cycle menant d\u2019une version V \u00e0 la version V+1.La maintenance \u00e9volutive concerne g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement 3 aspects de la vie d\u2019un site ou d\u2019une application web :Le contenuLes fonctionnalit\u00e9sL\u2019aspect cosm\u00e9tiqueLe contenuSur certains sites, l\u2019ajout, la suppression et la mise \u00e0 jour du contenu repr\u00e9sentent la quasi totalit\u00e9 de la maintenance \u00e9volutive, et accessoirement, 120% des probl\u00e8mes qui y sont li\u00e9s. Cela est notamment du aux processus parfois tr\u00e8s lourds qui accompagnent la production de contenu \u00e9ditorial, auxquels viennent s\u2019ajouter les probl\u00e9matiques politiques de l\u2019\u00e9metteur.Les fonctionnalit\u00e9sUne des premi\u00e8res choses que j\u2019avais point\u00e9e dans l\u2019introduction \u00e0 cette s\u00e9rie d\u2019articles \u00e9tait la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de faire vivre son site, que ce soit par l\u2019ajout et la mise \u00e0 jour de contenus, ou, m\u00eame minimes, de fonctionnalit\u00e9s.On m\u2019a un jour demand\u00e9 pourquoi ajouter des fonctionnalit\u00e9s entre les versions. C\u2019est une tr\u00e8s bonne question, et je vous remercie de ne pas me l\u2019avoir pos\u00e9e. J\u2019y vois 3 raisons principales :Parce que les besoins ont \u00e9volu\u00e9 depuis la mise en chantier du site ou de l\u2019application et qu\u2019il faut en tenir compte. Apr\u00e8s tout, c\u2019est \u00e0 \u00e7a que sert la maintenance, mettre en place ce \u00e0 quoi l\u2019on n\u2019avait pas pens\u00e9.Parce que le contexte l\u2019exige, par exemple \u00e0 l\u2019occasion d\u2019une campagne marketing.Apr\u00e8s des retours d\u2019utilisation, que ce soient de testeurs qualifies ou des utilisateurs ordinaires de l\u2019application.L\u2019avantage des fonctionnalit\u00e9s sur le contenu, c\u2019est qu\u2019elles pr\u00e9sentent une facette beaucoup moins politique, tant qu\u2019elles ne permettent pas de produire de contenu non contr\u00f4l\u00e9, notamment par la communication externe, \u00e9videmment.L\u2019aspect cosm\u00e9tiqueLes \u00e9volutions cosm\u00e9tiques d\u2019un site ou d\u2019une application en mode maintenance doivent toujours \u00eatre limit\u00e9es et r\u00e9fl\u00e9chies. La charte graphique est en effet le premier \u00e9l\u00e9ment vu par les visiteurs, c\u2019est pourquoi elle doit servir deux objectifs :Accompagner une op\u00e9ration contextuelle, comme No\u00ebl, les grandes vacances, une op\u00e9ration marketing\u2026 notamment par une iconographie claire et adapt\u00e9e.Am\u00e9liorer l\u2019exp\u00e9rience de navigation.Il serait \u00e9videmment facile de d\u00e9battre sur le sujet pendant des heures, mais ce n\u2019est pas mon sujet aujourd\u2019hui.

Vous aurez certainement \u00e0 faire travailler ensemble des entit\u00e9s qui s\u2019\u00e9vitent g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement le plus possible : IT et marketing, IT et communication institutionnelle\u2026 \u00e0 croire que tout le monde cherche \u00e0 \u00e9viter l\u2019IT.Si vous avez la possibilit\u00e9 de planifier les \u00e9volutions un tant soit peu \u00e0 l\u2019avance, profitez-en pour remplir le tableau crois\u00e9 des \u00e9volutions et des intervenants.

As promised here is the second part of my article on Web3D.I founded 360\u00b0 3D World a year and a half ago when I determined VR/AR/MX is poised to generate 50 BILLION DOLLARS within 4 years! The rapid growth is in part due to the substantial investments and innovations led by tech giants such as Apple, Google, Samsung and Facebook, including advanced programming interfaces (API), software developer kits (SDK), platforms, and services, as they seek to lead the adoption of the next big computing platform.What\u2019s interesting is virtual reality technologies are build upon ideas that date back to the 1800s, almost to the very beginning of practical photography. In 1838, the first stereoscope was invented, using twin mirrors to project a single image. That eventually developed into a children\u2019s toy View-Master, patented in 1939 and still produced today. Every kid I knew grew up with a View-Master!The use of the term \u201cvirtual reality,\u201d however, was first used in the mid-1980s when the founder of VPL Research, Jaron Lanier, began to develop the gear, including goggles and gloves, needed to experience what he called \u201cvirtual reality.\u201dThe history of augmented reality dates back to 1968, when a Harvard professor and computer scientist by the name of Ivan Sutherland invented what he called The Sword of Damocles. He invented this first sort of augmented reality device with his student, Bob Sproull.Augmented reality didn\u2019t see widespread adoption until Pok\u00e9mon hit the scene, and now we have dozens of Augmented Reality apps and games. Here\u2019s a few\u2026\u2022\tFITNESS AR. \u2026\u2022\tIKEA PLACE. \u2026\u2022\tHOUSECRAFT. \u2026\u2022\tMEASUREKIT. \u2026\u2022\tTAPMEASURE. \u2026\u2022\tEUCLIDEAN LANDS\u2026Now that you know when VR came into our lives let\u2019s talk about what we are able to do today, and what\u2019s coming tomorrow, and why I refer to this revolution as Web 3D.Initially Matterport VR was used specifically for residential real estate. However the partnership between Matterport and Google, plus dozens on other cameras allows photographers to upload the 3D spaces to google street view so there is virtually (pun intended) no limit to the types of applications for AR/VR.My camera, along with the Matterport Cloud Platform has scanned and sold almost 5 MILLION dollars in residential real estate in Chicago. In addition I have captured commercially a private club 67 floors above Chicago, a restaurant, a restaurant patio, the school library (I graduated 8th grade from), a barbershop, and a pet store, to name a few.What makes the commercial scans unique is that they are able to be published to google street view, the greatest syndication tool in modern history. Although they aren\u2019t as dynamic as an embedded scan, it\u2019s a fantastic way to convince people to stop in.After we publish the space to SV, visitors can spend less time searching for building directories and more time discovering new points of interest. Simply navigate in and out of a building and go floor to floor in the space. This functionality is not just a novelty. Combining satellite, aerial and street level imagery, Google Maps has over 20 petabytes of data, which is equal to approximately 21 million gigabytes, or around 20,500 terabytes.Plus the facts are crystal clear. The majority of people use a mapping application to check out a destination BEFORE they visit. Further, 49% of those people will visit in person.The other verticals we work with are AEC (architecture, engineering & construction. We are able to produce \u201cas built\u201d floor-plans to jump start any project. We are also able to highlight specific spots in the structure to follow up on the builders punch list.ECommerce sites can have virtual walk throughs and insert Mattertags on points of interest and items for sale. Mattertags can be inserted to link to their eCommerce site so the customer can make a purchase. If the buyer is in the model, they can see products CONTEXTUALLY with other items. A couch with the table you want. 3 different shades of blue in a dress, etc.What businesses will learn with this Hyper-connectivity is that their place of business is every much a part of their branding as their logo, or font. Businesses like restaurants and car dealerships spend many millions of dollars on the structures they do business in. A web browser should be treated to the same visuals to retain that customer, and maybe get him/her to stop buy, and spend more money.I don\u2019t believe virtual reality and hyper-connectivity are a fad, rather it\u2019s a TREND.

So welcome back onto the show Rune. Can you give the listeners a little bit of an intro about yourself in case you know, some of them may have not seen the last episode given that it was all the way back in 2016.Rune Christensen: Yeah, absolutely. And yes, thanks for having me back here. It\u2019s pretty wild to sort of look back three years in time and the crypto space. So this is a very interesting opportunity I think and just quickly about myself, so basically I did a lot of attempts at startups when I was younger and worked a lot of time in Asia when I then discovered blockchain technology and first got into Bitcoin but really into Bitcoin, you know became like a real Bitcoin type back in 2011/2012, but then over time I got somewhat disillusioned by Bitcoin\u2019s volatility really and so the fact that it wasn\u2019t seeing less kind of the mainstream adoption that people predicted initially. And I think to a large extent that was because of the volatility because it\u2019s not it\u2019s more useless gold rather than regular currency. So I got into stable coins and I discovered BitShares which was the first decentralized stable grant project, but unfortunately due to many reasons BitShares never really gained the kind of traction that we hoped for and instead me and a couple of other people from the BitShares community eventually pretty much switched over to Ethereum and it kind of took the stable coin component from BitShares and tried to implement it on Ethereum.Sunny: So were you actively involved with the development of BitShares?Rune: No, you could say I was a very active community member and many of these like fundamental ideas around Maker DAO all come straight from from the idea of BitShares. In particular like you have regular community members ultimately being like despite not being sort of an official developer of the project, I still was very deeply involved in sort of the core of the governance of it, which is exactly what is so powerful about blockchain technologies and entities.Sunny: So the BitShares system, you know, they used their contract for difference system. You know, can you tell us a little bit about some of the things that why BitShares, you know, maybe didn\u2019t work and how that kind of contributed to your design of the Maker system with the CDP\u2019s.Rune: Yeah, so there\u2019s really a couple of reasons I would say this is really three major reasons why like, I mean, it\u2019s three major things that to some extent got ambitious, so first of all was that BitShares was this it was not like Ethereum smart contract platform rather it was kind of like a Swiss army knife. So so it\u2019s like a single platform or like a single project that tried to do many different things. Right? So it\u2019s both it did stable coins, which is mainly like was kind of its main product and really the biggest innovation of the project but it also did things like privacy and like a very advanced privacy system and things like account names which is a time like instead of having the long strings like having actual account names was like we were revolutionary and just like a whole range of other things like decentralized exchange. There was even like some music related stuff, which is I think is funny it\u2019s kind of related to what ended up happening with Rchain many years later, but I mean, there\u2019s just there was a lot of try to do a lot of things and as a result, it didn\u2019t really miss so well on any one specific product at least within the very early like big window of opportunity that it had back even before Ethereum launched. And then secondly, there were some fundamental problems with its stable coin design still chiefly that the stable coins were based on a single collateral type. So they were only collateralized by the BitShares acid itself. So actually similar to the current design of single titled DAI and the downside with that approach is that it really limits the level that the system can scale because once you get to a certain size, you cannot create the systemic risk where the stable coin failing could take down the entire platform and that\u2019s of course, like that\u2019s the really big innovation that we brought to the table in that we actually figured out how do you take this basic approach with a single level type and you actually design a system that has many different collateral types, which can then diversify and really mitigate the risk that\u2019s inherited having just a single level type, and even branch out the use case way beyond what was originally envisioned in terms of like even accessing real world assets and all sorts of even more sort of futuristic stuff. And then I think the final point that I think is also like has been really critical for our development and really a big part of how Maker has evolved is that the BitShares community and of the BitShares philosophy was quite extreme in that it was really like hardcore call anarchism in many ways and really by to some extent totally detached from reality which then ended up just like, you know turning off a lot of people who would otherwise have been interested in but were turned off by like the idea that if you want to use this super awesome technology, you also have to like subscribe to all this ideology, right which is not always in fact, it\u2019s a pretty bad strategy for trying to get business adoption. So Maker did start off very much derived from that anarchist philosophy for sure, but it was with the mindset that the end goal is to make change in the real world and and that perspective then let us on this like ability to essentially grow up alongside the rest of the ecosystem right because really today the blockchain space is just very different from what it was even back in 2016.Friederike Ernst: Yeah, absolutely and we\u2019ll deep dive into how exactly the stability mechanism works in a second but just as a catch-up, can you can you give us the 90 second version of what had happened since we last had you on the show?Rune: Yeah, I mean, I think it is really mind-blowing if you could go back to 2016 and then tell people what the landscape looks like today with like Maker out in the world and things like Compound another DeFi projects all working together, but just the very basic milestones right is obviously the launch of single collateral DAI, which was really to some extent the first launch of like a like the first successful launch of a major dapp and then followed immediately by the trial by fire as it had to survive a 95% crashing its collateral right just starting immediately from its launch and actually single collateral DAI was able to you know, totally like brush it off, so there was that complete crash in 2018 and at no point in time did it in any way come close to threaten the stability of DAI or threatened the integrity of the pick. So that really created this critical proof point that the technology did in fact work in the way it was supposed to work which then led to just this greater sense of trust in system and ultimately adoption following that. So in summer 2018 the system hit its initial debt ceiling of 50 million and the governance had to actually raise it beyond that and then it went all the way to about 80 million DAI in circulation, which is where it\u2019s sits today as well as something like I think it\u2019s more than 300 million dollars worth of Ethereum locked as collateral in the system right now. And then what came next was the proliferation of the DeFi ecosystem, so this sprawling ecosystem of startups that could really be made by anyone right like and I can fit together seamlessly and because they have DAI as their source of decentralized stability they can actually provide very useful products and very useful services without giving up a sort of compromising on the decentralization which is otherwise often what you see is the the trade-off with for instance something, let me just with Bitcoin for instance a lot of very interesting stuff you do that or just other other systems that aren\u2019t based around smart contracts you very often have to give up decentralisation to get more advanced functionality and I think this might be the first time we\u2019ve seen this like we\u2019ve seen the opposite where we\u2019ve actually seen that decentralization in fact adds to the functionality and adds to the convenience of using these dapps because they all fit together seamlessly, right which is I mean, it is really mind-blowing I think and it\u2019s not many people think about that also because maybe many people didn\u2019t really run around in 2015/2016 when Ethereum started but it is pretty crazy that the ecosystem has actually been able to deliver on that promise of like this seamless interconnection between trustless and permissionless financial services. And then finally, I think this has been a little bit more than 90 seconds now, but the final and perhaps the well in my opinion the most critical milestone is that the community was able to bootstrap the decentralized governance of the single colateral DAI protocol and actually begin controlling the system directly through the MKR tokens in a very active and very well somewhat efficient manner although with a few pitfalls here and there but but that\u2019s has really been I mean that is the most incredible thing of all because of all the things it is really the decentralized governance that defines the Maker project the most and it is the critical value proposition and the critical feature of the system that really makes it interesting because it promises to deliver something that\u2019s completely different from existing financial systems, that are all incredibly locked down and and with with this like inherent lack of transparency and and very often contradicting incentives built into the system. I mean, there\u2019s also just one of the things that many people didn\u2019t believe it was even possible right like I mean, in fact we didn\u2019t even really I mean we weren\u2019t really sure if it was even going to be possible to do if you could actually launch a like a like a sustainable financial system and then just let it be controlled by random strangers over the internet as long as they have the right incentives by holding the right token, but but it has actually played out right and and nowadays we\u2019ve reached a point where on a weekly basis the MKR holders actually manage the system actually.Friederike: Can you explain to us how the system makes sure, that one DAI is always 1 US dollar. So I mean just for just just for the larger picture. There are other stable tokens such as you USCC and the Gemini that our supposedly backed by a dollar in the bank for each one of these coins that are issued. So DAI actually works differently and that it\u2019s backed by crypto collateral. So how does that work? And how do you peg the value to the dollar?Rune: Yeah, very important question. There\u2019s kind of two mechanisms to it, there\u2019s two sides to it. So there\u2019s the there\u2019s the long-term question of fundamental solvency and I guess you can see resilience of the system, which is like can it like is it really is a real value there behind the token or is it all just like hot air ? And that\u2019s where the answer is. It comes from the unchained collateralization, right? So the reason why you know that there\u2019s real value in your DAI it\u2019s because you can go to the blockchain, you know right now go to mkr.tools for instance and you can actually you know on your own do a complete audit of every single aspect of the system in real time even and you can ensure that there\u2019s always this fundamental and inherent solvency in the system as well as a safe level of over collateralization. So that despite the system right now being backed by only Eth and the inherent volatility of Eth, it\u2019s still able to remain stable even in situations such as the 2018 crash because the risk parameters, so the kind of like the the safety logic of the system that keeps it safe from things like a crash is set correctly so that you could have a you know, you can have a significant fall in the price of Eth but that\u2019s fine because there\u2019s about five times as much value of Eth in the system as there is outstanding DAI in the market. So the system can handle a very big crash. So that\u2019s kind of like the fundamental value in the system. That means that there\u2019s a potential here for for sort of for stability. But then the other question is how do you create short-term stability one one hand? So like pegged price, right? So stays at the same price point but even more importantly how do you create liquidity? Right? So how do you make it possible to move large amounts of DAI into Eth or into another stable coin or even cash it out for Fiat and the answer is that it\u2019s it is like you said it\u2019s kind of the system keeps it stable, but perhaps a better way to think of it is that it\u2019s the government\u2019s that keeps the keeps it stable and then actually takes care of this because it is managed through the like adjusting the rates in the system. So basically the cost of generating DAI primarily is how it works right now. In the future, it will also be the savings rates like the gains you get from holding DAI, but it\u2019s not going to be available until a future version. So right now it\u2019s actually purely done on the the generating DAI side, which is really it\u2019s similar to changing the cost of borrowing US Dollars, which is exactly how the let\u2019s say the Federal Reserve central banks in general they maintain the value of their currencies. So what they do is they modify the interest rates and as a result, they basically change how likely it is someone in the market is going to borrow money which expands the supply right? Because when you borrow money in a fractional Reserve System, you\u2019re essentially creating new money or other or will do the opposite right pay back their loans and actually just hold on to my money if the interest rates higher. So it\u2019s the same thing that the Maker system doesn\u2019t that governance controls is they modify what\u2019s called the stability fee, which is the fee that someone pays to essentially borrow DAI or generate DAI by depositing collateral into the system and then utilizing the smart contract system to to essentially print you DAI. And then the stability fee is the price you have to pay for this for this service and it\u2019s cut and that\u2019s what I was referring to that this is what\u2019s been actively modified every single week right now by the decentralized governance.Friederike: This stability fee has gone up from I think initially something like 5 or 7% to currently over 20% What do you make of that? So what what what do you think this means for the ecosystem not in terms of how expensive it is to borrow money, but in terms of what does this say about the ecosystem what has changed? What\u2019s the underlying metric that has changed?Rune: Yeah, it actually started at 0.5% when the system was launched and the very basic assumption that turned out to be wrong is that there\u2019s going to be incredible demand for decentralized stable coin. And which is kind of like the simple use case, right and sort of the basic value proposition of the Maker protocol. And then this the secondary use case of generating DAI, which is a much more advanced type of way to interact with the system which is its and it\u2019s similar to its similar to borrowing money in the bank or taking out a mortgage or even margin trading in some situations where you deposit collateral into the system and you generate DAI, right? And yeah, it was just the first of all the interface to do this was incredibly complicated and it took about seven Ethereum transactions to even have a CDP go through and it was just all so like it\u2019s a very advanced and completely cutting edge and new type of service right like the very first DeFi app and that had never been done before the term DeFi even existed. So we naturally assumed that it was going to be more difficult to people to do that part whereas it\u2019ll be easier to get them to use the most simple and approachable stable coin functionality. And this was also the case very in the very beginning but very quickly the idea of DeFi of being able to in a decentralized system actually access financing for your inventory and taking on decentralized margin positions was was a very powerful idea and it\u2019s essentially spread like wildfire with people teaching each other I guess how to how to use this even in the very first stage when it was so different to use. So what ended up happening is that there were way more people interested in using the advanced DAI generation functionality to to borrow and borrow DAI open CDP\u2019s than there are people using DAI naturally and then what the system does is, because what this affects is the supply and demand. So you have sort of the demand for DAI which sits at some particular level and then you have the supply of DAI which which sits somewhere else and they\u2019re kind of independent of each other as in people holding DAI are people who want to go out and use a stable coin maybe spend it, people who open CDP\u2019s have a completely different demand, right? They\u2019re interested in leverage and financing. So what has to happen is they have to meet exactly in the middle so they have to be exactly the same because if they\u2019re not the price won\u2019t be $1. So if let\u2019s say supplies higher and demand is lower the price will be below a dollar and if it\u2019s the other way around the price will be above it. And so what governance does fundamentally to kind of like tie them into sync is to adjust the stability fee so it so what that means is adjusting on the supply side how interesting, just like the terms on which you can generate DAI. Because if the stability fees higher it costs way more to generate DAI, unless people are going to be interested in it. So that\u2019s why and that\u2019s then how we know that what happened is that there were tons of demand for generating DAI because the stability fee just shut up which meant that without it like if the stability fee had stayed the same the system probably wouldn\u2019t be in sync today. It would probably be like, they\u2019ll be way more DAI outstanding but also the price would be below $1.Sunny: So why was the stability fee the only way to modify the supply, I mean in a way what should we expect that, you know back when the DAI price dip to like, you know, 80 cents or something shouldn\u2019t we expect that the difference from the shelling point of $1 should provide the CDP creators enough incentive to arbitrage that and you know, maybe buy a bunch of DAI close their CDP\u2019s allow the system to go back up and then reopen the CDP\u2019s when the DAI prices back to a dollar.Rune: Yeah that and that\u2019s the basic assumption of how it\u2019s a very micro scale the system remains stable,? But the thing is that that assumption depends on another assumption right which is that governance will actually act to deal with the balance. And that\u2019s that\u2019s of course in the early stages of the system there\u2019s less proof that got the governance actually works. So the fact that the shelling point even is $1 isn\u2019t really as established compared to you know, after basically today where people are a lot more willing to trust the fact that the price will go back to $1.Sunny: Do you think part of the issue might be that the set of people who are able to participate in Arbitrage is limited. Where are you know, I guess what I was first learning about DAI like it didn\u2019t it gets it in hit me and then when I was looking at it again, like, you know, like a couple years ago, it took me a while to realize that oh wait the DAI holders actually don\u2019t have any claims to underlying collateral, assuming, you know, except in the case of triggering a global settlement. But because it\u2019s not possible for the DAI holders to actually, you know, go against basically, you know, the only people who are able to Arbitrage it are the CDP holders and they have to over collateralize so heavily and so that heavily limits the set of potential arbitrageurs thus making it a much more inefficient market.Rune: What\u2019s actually being arbitraged and I mean this is the part that can be very difficult to to sort of wrap your head around right but it really is the cost of capital. So there is no fundamental claim in any way to $1 unless in a situation that you described the global settlement, right, which is a very like niche each case that isn\u2019t actually meant to even happen. My point is that even a CDP holder doesn\u2019t have some like direct way of saying if I have one DAI sort of automatically unlocks $1 value elsewhere. I mean you could it does of course apply on the actual liquidation ratio sure, but it doesn\u2019t like I mean in the end it\u2019s a different concern compared to kind of like the risk management at the larger scale, right? And in reality what they\u2019re what they\u2019re really looking at is the cost of capital. So what they\u2019re they\u2019re interested in is how likely are they going like other going to make more money if they hold onto the CDP and they hold onto the leveraged position of Eth for instance in there. And despite and paying whatever cost to have to pay on the both on the you know on the stability fee side, but also on whatever potential, you know Arbitrage gain that would be and the thing is that in many cases, you know, even if the Arbitrage potentially huge it might not actually outweigh the the sort of imagined gain or like the projected gains of a CDP holder so there\u2019s just so many dynamics playing into this where there\u2019s only one solution and that is very proficient management of the stability fee and the monetary policy of the system. But with that in place it should theoretically be exactly as efficient as the current monetary system is in this regard, but of course with the extra benefit of also being even more seamless and blockchain based and so on.Sunny: So to make it as efficient as the current monetary system that would make the claim that the MKR holders are as proficient at monetary policy as you know, the people at the Federal Reserve who are you know, generally much, you know trained economists and stuff. Two questions here one, which is a question I\u2019ve had for a long time and I unfortunately couldn\u2019t find any good resources answering it on the Internet is how was MKR distributed because you know, there was never any sort of ICO or anything done for MKR. Yeah kind of how was that distributed, what percentage of it is still in the hands of the foundation as well as the VC\u2019s and then what percentage of it in the hands of the wider public and then two, how do we make sure that the people who are holding this MKR aren\u2019t necessarily the most sound monetary policy decision Makers.Rune: Yes, this is really the fundamental question of the system because like I said earlier the decentralized governance is the core feature and I mean the basic underlying assumption is that if you have a proper open and equal playing field, I guess you can say for the science and the knowledge related to monetary policy, you will always be able to beat any amount of experts right because you will have the entire global body of knowledge participating directly in governance, which means that you could even have let\u2019s say central banks participating potentially right and they would all have the exact same point of access and the exact same framework to participate as well every other Central Bank or every other Commercial Bank or every other like random econ nerd sitting in the basement that kind of like thinking about Innovative new, you know ideas around it. And the thing is that in the end it\u2019s very hard to sort of say who is like, I mean, it\u2019s very hard to pick kind of like this genius person who knows how to like run the world economy, right? Because it\u2019s kind of like macroeconomics and monetary policy is is actually to some extent a bit similar to Voodoo in that it\u2019s not totally like it\u2019s not you know, it\u2019s quite white fluid and it\u2019s quite to some extent an art form as well. So what that means is that it\u2019s not really guaranteed that like highly decorated ultra expert is the guy that will prevent the financial crisis from happening. It could just as easily be someone who\u2019s just seen something that no one else saw because they all were locked in their old way of thinking or something like that. And the core idea of the Maker DAO decentralized governance is that what we want to do is we want to create I mean what we really think of as something like something similar to a scientific community where there is a free playing field and freeze of open framework for all ideas to participate in like an unbiased forum where you can have where every perspective gets a chance to participate. So whether it\u2019s established Central Bank or the sort of the the the more radical and more modern or whatever new innovative approaches, of course, there has to be like, I mean, once you\u2019ve sort of opened that Pandora\u2019s Box, there\u2019s so many questions there such as moderation and priority and so on right that needs to be considered and in the end and that\u2019s maybe also like a like a critical other piece of it is is that you have to of course, you have to grant yourself in a conservative mindset, right? Because of course if you just go out and sort of do radical monetary policy, you will quickly end up looking like Venezuela or Turkey or something right where people try to defy gravity which of course you can\u2019t do right? Yeah, like the basic answer really is that you could say that like even if the FED had the world\u2019s top economists and monetary policy gurus, they will still just be a subset of the people who will be able to participate and have direct line, like both have direct access and line of sight to make a governance but also have that direct ability to actually influence the governance itself. This then comes back to the question of decentralized governance, and MKR holders how you actually implement this in practice because many people think that sort of the basic idea of Maker governess is just MKR holders just vote and decide whatever they want, they basically do whatever they want and that\u2019s the end, but it\u2019s actually a much more sophisticated framework where it\u2019s more than MKR holders have this role of trying to surface the key rational points made in this scientific framework and and only sort of by going for this rational approach and trying to reach something that\u2019s subjective and it\u2019s is vetted as possible are you able to actually reach a shelling point where you can even get consensus around the direct approach.Friederike: Before we dive into the governance ,Sunny asked earlier, how are the Maker tokens actually distributed initially? So who are these people who actually hold Maker?Rune: There was initially 1 million MKR tokens created by me really and a couple of other guys in the early days and we knew like we knew from the very beginning that because again, like the MKR token holders are not meant to kind of like run the system through a popularity contest but they are of course very important in that with the wrong set of stakeholders you could have like you could easily see how the system could fail right so we knew very early on that it would be too risky to just do for instance an ICO and try to pump the token and get a bunch of speculators in but rather it\u2019s all about choosing the right set of stakeholders. So the very first approach was to to distribute it directly to people who volunteered to work on the project contributing with like with like science or engineering or to select various forms of contributions to the project and then also selling directly to to some like engaged community members that were kind of like essentially like a part of the early days of the core engaged group, right, which is very different from how an ICO operated because the early major project actually distinguishes Itself by sort of almost doing negative marketing like five club-style like it was actually meant to kind of be a bit of a secret club where the right people needed to get some space to get their head around it before the masses came in I guess you\u2019d say, right and of course after a while the system grew to a point where the community felt confident enough to kind of open up wider and make the project more widely known which actually coincided then when I did those very early podcasts including here on epicenter, this came at the same time as like the increased scrutiny of the blockchain space as well as new regulation and new kind of like concerns around, you know, especially token distribution. So, basically once we reached that point it became very clear to us and from the perspective of a legal strategy that the only reasonable way to distribute tokens like MKR would be to sell it to like essentially like, you know, like like established and just like the, you know, very very proficient institutional investors. So so in the US accredited establishments, and just in general the kind of like the kind of stakeholder where you could sell them a token and they could go totally poof and be worth nothing and everyone would be like that was your own fault, right? Because you knew what you were getting into and you did your own research, and on the other hand if you actually try to again like if you try to sell to the masses and things blew up it\u2019s a little bit different like there\u2019s a level of trust there that\u2019s kind of expected to be to be maintained when you do that, which is also where we saw the whole ICO craze go wrong. But the biggest event of when we started this new approach of selling MKR to large established stakeholders was of course when we sold actually a total of six percent to Andreessen Horowitz which was among the very first purchases of digital assets and to this day is kind of like one of the absolute core pieces of their crypto portfolio that also really put the project on the map right because it was a huge stamp of approval in the more established VC and the crypto world and even wider financial space or tech space to get Andreessen Horowitz buying into this project and also participating directly like in terms of promoting it and talking about the implications of the project and as well as supporting the foundation in all sorts of activities we were doing. So like I mean today it\u2019s basically a mix of kind of like early community contributors, early community buyers, like people who\u2019ve bought it on the secondary, especially in the early days. There\u2019s particularly a lot of Chinese people who did that so there\u2019s actually a very significant Chinese community in the Maker DAO ecosystem. And then there\u2019s a lot of these institutional stakeholders including Andreessen Horowitz, which is one of the biggest but then also actually a lot of other sort of smaller like I guess you can say medium-sized institutional stakeholders.Friederike: Before we dive into what exactly governance means in this instance and what MKR coders can actually do with their Maker tokens. The stability fee that is generated currently still goes to Maker holders, right? It doesn\u2019t go to the DAI or does it goes exclusively to Maker holders. What was the rationale behind that design decision when you made it.Rune: It\u2019s really fundamental economic dynamic on a system that kind of makes it go round in a sense that it aligns incentives between the different participants in the system. So it really it\u2019s very basically that MKR holders they sit sort of at the I guess you can say the core of the system and they they fundamentally perform the governance functions system so they decide really how like the business logic of the system and what it\u2019s actually doing, so it includes like stabilizing the price of DAI and so on by leveraging a stability fee on CDP holders, but also in the future other more advanced functionality such as also setting the DAI savings rate and a whole range of other stuff on advanced governance, but most crucially the thing that they like they\u2019re doing right is that they\u2019re setting their collective risk parameters and sort of the logic around how do we keep the system safe from a crash? Right? So how do we make sure that we don\u2019t put all our eggs in one basket so that we\u2019re only relying on you know, a single cryptocurrency as collateral, even when we are at a scale of several billions because that\u2019s when you really get that systemic risk that could just see the whole thing wiped out and also the ratios are set correctly so that you know, like I mean, do you have the right amount of buffer, you know in excess of a particular position the system where you\u2019ve put in some collateral to generate DAI and then the MKR holders then make sure that when you do that the excess collateral that you put in is enough to cover the volatility of that asset, right? And then the key aspect is that if they set this incorrectly, right? So if they failed to correctly predict the system from excess risk, they have to absorb that excess risk. So let\u2019s say that they allow a cryptocurrency that\u2019s not particularly good into the system as collateral and they allow it in with a very small gap, right so you can generate a lot of DAI from that cryptocurrency and then just like goes poof it\u2019s gone. There\u2019s no money left. Then what you what you end up with is it\u2019s bad debt on uncollateralized unbacked debt and without any other measures you actually have insolvency in that case, right? You actually have a situation where there\u2019s no longer guarantee that all DAI is backed by on chain collateral. But then that\u2019s where the MKR token steps in and takes the loss essentially through an automatic like fully autonomous mechanism that what it does is it\u2019s just that printing MKR to raise funds. So basically prints MKR like the system detects that there is a loss, detects there is a shortfall, then it prints MKR and then it automatically sells in the market to raise DAI from the market right to yeah, basically raise the same amount of DAI as there\u2019s a shortfall in the system and then it uses the DAI that is raised to essentially cancel out the shortfall by by burning the DAI like by removing the DAI from circulation so that it can kind of like have the two things equal out and make sure that now the amount of collateral is in the system is congruent with the amount of dollars in circulation.Sunny: So is this lender of last resort functionality actually implemented on the current live Maker contracts?Rune: No, so in single collateral DAI there\u2019s actually this additional mechanic called PETH, and all of this logic is implemented more on the kind of like the like the Eth CDP holder site with a I mean, it\u2019s actually it\u2019s a functionality that sounds very complicated when you explain it, which is like this aspect of the forced illusion of kinda like the underwrite of the system sits with the people also hold collateral in the system in the event of a serious crash.Sunny: So I guess my question is that in the moment in the single collateral DAI instance, is there any risk that the MKR holders take on because currently the lender of last resort risk is passed on to the CDP holders. So what is the risk that the MKR holders are currently being rewarded for?Rune: Yeah, I mean this is a very common concern. I guess you could say point made about the system. But if you really think about it, then right now as an MKR holder, you\u2019re taking more risks than you ever will because at this stage in the system\u2019s life cycle, there\u2019s a way larger probability that will just completely and outright fail, and that\u2019s the big additional dynamic of the MKR token today right that because you\u2019re acquiring MKR that\u2019s I guess you\u2019d say freshly made right because the system is brand-new, there\u2019s a way bigger risks that you\u2019re not really, you know, you\u2019re just buying into an experiment right and that of course it is by far the most established experiment on Ethereum, right? But I mean DeFi is still this thing that has yet to fully prove itself. So from that perspective, I mean MKR holders really still take by far the largest risk of anyone in the system right because I would say that there\u2019s a bigger risk of MKR . I mean Ethereum as a whole is obviously better established thank MKR so the dynamics of the system itself still doesn\u2019t directly impose a loss on MKR holders but of course if you had the system wipeout, it would sort of I guess as a second order effect also just wipe out the MKR token but I mean the thing is that none of that really it doesn\u2019t really matter that much because we just talked about the very early stage and microcosm of the system and its really, you know, it\u2019s like it\u2019s yeah, it\u2019s like it\u2019s kind of like initial phase where it hasn\u2019t yet scaled so these dynamics become a lot more important once we actually hit a larger scale where you have to, where there also is a real job for MKR holders to do in this in the sense of doing proper risk management by diversifying different assets.Friederike: So let\u2019s talk about what the MKR holders, what the scope of their governance currently is. So there\u2019s a couple of parameters that can be set and reset in the system. Can you describe what they are and how this voting or casting a spell happens?Rune: Yeah, so I want to explain all the parameters that can be modified by governance because there\u2019s actually a huge amount and the system is incredibly modular, but the sort of standard risk parameters so the standard things that MKR holders they deal with in the current system is, so there\u2019s the stability fee which is the cost of generating DAI from a CDP. Then there\u2019s the debt ceiling which is the total amount of DAI can be generated out of Eth, and then there\u2019s a liquidation ratio, which is the buffer between debts and collateral you need to have in the CDP before the system liquidates your position and and so governance really, I mean, the job of governance is to modify all of these. Primarily obviously it\u2019s the stability because that\u2019s how you stabilize the DAI market price in the wild and then there\u2019s a debt ceiling which is more like a routine thing you do as the system grows you kind of like evaluate the overall risk to allow it to grow to a larger size and you would still I mean you would very rarely see something like the liquidation ratio be adjusted in the in the wild in single level DAI because of the significant direct effects it would have on CDP holders who are actively holding a CDP, who could effectively have the rug pulled out from under them. So it would be it would be quite unlikely they were actually see the liquidation ratio changed and then there\u2019s also some other like some other more administrative things that the MKR holders could do such as changing the set of oracles and picking the oracle providers. That hasn\u2019t happened yet though so the oracles that exist in the system today are the same oracles that it was launched with.And then there\u2019s also another very critical functionality, which is emergency shutdown. So the ability to shut the system down in the face of some sort of like, I mean, the main reason is you want to use that in the face of a crypto economic attack or perhaps a bug found in the system or some other significant problem or maybe even a run on the bank, which is where you then establish this direct ability to turn the DAI into underlying collateral.Friederike: So, how does the voting system itself work. If I\u2019m a make a token holder, how do I participate in the governance?Rune: There\u2019s two aspects to that. So there is the onchain infrastructure, which is very simple. So it\u2019s basically a constantly it\u2019s like a vote that\u2019s constantly happening inside the smart contract called the chief where what the governance position do is they essentially you can say they stake their MKR inside the chief although it\u2019s better to think of it as they just participate in voting and it\u2019s just like a technical technical detail that they actually move the MKR into the chief. But once they\u2019ve done that then the MKR is able to vote and then they\u2019re actually able to essentially point the votes on any smart contract on the entire Ethereum blockchain and the system then is constantly keeping track of which smart contractor, which Ethereum address has the most votes. And whichever single address of smart contract that has the highest number of votes on the entire blockchain of all the votes and that\u2019s happening in the system is then given direct admin access into the core single collateral DAI. So the way that you for instance modify the stability fee is that, the way it works is that you do have a smart contract that basically says send a message to the core of single collateral DAI that says raise the stability fee by 2% something or rather set the stability fee to 14% if that\u2019s what you want to do. And then once that smart contract gets the highest number of votes in the system so it gets the admin access, then anyone can then go and poke it essentially which is called casting a spell because it\u2019s like a technical term for this kind of smart contract is spell. So what happens is anyone is able to then just like trigger the the proposal from like trigger the execution of the proposal and the transaction is then inserted into the system to modify the internal state of the system. And that\u2019s the smart contract infrastructure, so then just very briefly there\u2019s a layer on top of the resistors user-friendliness layer, right? And right now the foundation is the only one who maintains this kind of fronted but really what it is is like a voting dashboard where you can see different options for voting and like you can see different like there\u2019s even both a polling system. So sort of like a pre vote and then there\u2019s the actual system voting as well where you actually execute on decisions made in the community and it\u2019s then presented through it like an easy and secure interface that allows a larger amount of the community to participate.Friederike: Cool, what percentage of Makers typically pointed at proposals that then become the front-runner and become implemented.Rune: So right now it\u2019s typically between 5 to 10% and you also have at like you have this important dynamic of around also 5 to 10% of people are always voting at kind of like the current active proposal which then sets the bars like you have to get at least 7% of the vote to be able to like trigger a new proposal in the system and kind of like it really acts as a quorum in that sense.Friederike: You said earlier that Andreessen holds 6% Maker tokens, and there\u2019s a couple of other Maker wearers as well right? So basically it would it would only take one or two of those to actually force a proposal through right?Rune: Yeah. I mean, theoretically it\u2019s possible for someone to in the current system try to like pass and administer a proposal. And then the response to that would be to then trigger an emergency shutdown, and actually try to shut down the system from the from the crypto economic perspective. But the challenge in the system right now is that whereas in the multi-level DAI when the final version of the governance system is implemented there\u2019s actually some incredibly strong game theoretic checks and balances in place that makes this kind of behavior, even if you had let\u2019s say like anonymous actors holding let\u2019s say 50% of the tokens or even like all the tokens, well, okay, I mean just like significant amounts of the tokens, you still have just like like incredibly rigorous game-theoretic systems in place that prevent anyone from actually acting maliciously in the system. In the current state of the system rather a key defense comes from the fact that it\u2019s known to the foundation. For instance the foundation has been very careful in who has sold to these like least large blocks to and it doesn\u2019t involve like a see a nation state actor which could for some reason decide that they want to shut down the system and kind of like vandalize it, rather they just very rational economic actors that you know wouldn\u2019t wouldn\u2019t harm themselves by by burning the system down, but like I mean, that\u2019s always a dynamic of all decentralized system, and all these centralized governance, is that by the very nature of having the governance be fully decentralized and having the final and the fundamental control of the system being available to decentralize community, you always have this element of allowing people to shoot themselves in the foot if they want to.Friederike: The question always is what percentage of people actually have to glue to shoot everyone in the foot and one would wish that in a system that creates so much value and holds so much money would have to be more than 5 to 10% so can you tell us what\u2019s going to change for the new governance model that that you talked about?Rune: Yes. So the way that we saw this problem, t\u2019s really based on two fundamental approaches, two fundamental constructs. The first is what\u2019s called the governance security module. So this smart contract where it kind of sits between the voting system and then the core system itself as kind of a security buffer, a firewall in a way, and it works quite simply, when you create a proposal at your execute a proposal in the voting side it then passes into the governance security module and then sits there for some predetermined amount of time which initially would likely be between 24 hours and up to a week. And then once it has sort of run its course in the governance security module and been subject to the security delay it then executes and enters the core system. And so you have this this approach combined with what\u2019s called the emergency shutdown module so which is really just an upgrade of how emergency shutdown currently functions in the system and what the emergency shutdown module does is it allows a fixed and and quite small potentially percentage of MKR holders to trigger an emergency shutdown. Which right now at launch it\u2019s going to be 5%. And so what that means is that any constellation in the community that\u2019s able to muster 5% of the total MKR supply will be able to counter a malicious proposal that\u2019s sitting in the governance security module. So if someone tries to let\u2019s say yeah just like burn down the system or steal all the collateral or somehow like try to harm the system, then they will need to first of all let\u2019s say buy 51% of all MKR or maybe if there\u2019s only 15 percent voting then 15% of MKR but some significant amount of MKR . And then they use that to trigger the proposal but then it just goes into the governance security module and the meantime the honest actors in the system can then essentially rarely and respond by triggering an emergency shutdown of the system and what then happens is the system shuts down, it totally unwinds everyone is able to exit the position at the technical blockchain level. But in practice the way it plays out is that you immediately deploy a new system and then you provide what we call a smooth transition. So we provide this is what\u2019s really more like an upgrade process where you can transition from the old system that is now shut down and then to the new deployment as seamlessly as possible and this is also how we for instance do the upgrade from single colateral DAI to multi collateral DAI. The point is obviously to make it as painless and as seamless as possible for the end user but the really critical game theoretical piece to this is that in the new deployment because anyone is able to do a new deployment, it\u2019s just an open you just deploy some open source code, but the community will ultimately will in most situations reach consensus and kind of like equilibrate towards a single successful deployment that then just becomes the new Maker system and this deployment could in response to for instance an attacker just blatantly try to attack the system, steal all the collateral or harm the system in some way and using a significant amount of MKR for that. In response to that attack you can actually just burn the MKR in the new deployment, you could choose to what you call honor the MKR of everyone else or you can choose to kind of like let everyone else\u2019s MKR transition over but obviously there\u2019s not really a good reason to allow a clearly malicious attacker who has voted to harm the system from gaining governance power, right? So, what do you think get is you get stronger governance with a bad excess cut out of the system and you also get a like a significant MKR burn. So you get a significant reduction in total supply which then makes up for all the friction that having to go through this whole process cost you and the same dynamic also actually exists for someone who abuses in the first place its power to do an emergency shutdown. So someone goes on kind of like, let\u2019s have some fun and shut the whole thing down because it\u2019s quite easy to, the barrier for doing that is still it\u2019s initially for instance 50k MKR and which will then not be honored in the new deployment if it was purely a troll attack and then you again you have this dynamic where yeah, like the attacker did manage to shut the system down but there was a smooth transition to a new system and it cost them a ton of money and that money actually went to MKR holders.Friederike: So who decides whether a shutdown was in fact a troll attack whether a proposal was malicious because there could have been just a bug in it or the people honestly thought that the system was under attack. So who actually determines whether to penalize Maker holders or not?Rune: So it\u2019s quite a complex question really rather a complex issue. But the basic answer is that the community decides because because anyone can deploy a Maker system at any point inside, because the code is open source, you could actually very easily imagine that immediately after the merger shut down there might be for 10 or a thousand new deployments, and everyone saying this is my you know, also super awesome deployment where I haven\u2019t you know, and then maybe I mean there might be people trying to like give themselves extra MKR or there might be people to try to like cut out MKR of people they don\u2019t like or something. And the question is which new MKR distribution is able to basically, you know, get the faith of the overall community and the economic majority of the of the ecosystem, and in most cases like in clear-cut cases such as someone blatantly attacking a system, it\u2019s really obvious that you have this, I mean you essentially have the like a governance convention, you can even call the social convention that if you try to attack the system, you don\u2019t deserve your MKR , and and there\u2019s a good reason to migrate to a system that doesn\u2019t include MKR holders that have proven that their malicious to the system. So it really comes down to like the dynamics of what do the users of the system think is best for them when they\u2019re picking what system to migrate to and that\u2019s also actually and not like that is actually like one of the maybe the most fundamental point of Maker governance. Because that is the point where you actually see that the power of MKR holders isn\u2019t infinite. They don\u2019t actually decide everything like they kind of run the system on a day-to-day basis until the moment that a very significant event happens until the point where the governance has to kind of like fracture and reassemble itself. And then what happens is the power actually falls back to the economic participants themselves and MKR will just become totally powerless. And the only thing they can do is point to the past actions and say hey I was so good at governing the system so I should totally be a part of the new deployment.Sunny: So what\u2019s the worst thing that they could get away with so could they for example steal all the collateral by like setting the stability fee to a 100% and get away with that. Like what would be the potential reward that they could get away with with an attack?Rune: Like if there was no response from the community? It could actually be anything like it could be printing like I mean this system is like because the system completely relies on this dynamic of triggering an emergency shutdown within the time frame allotted by the governance security module like because it would be impossible regardless so there\u2019s no attempt to kind of like restrict what kind of technical access governance already has. The question is is that outcome ultimately going to be better for like the average user and the average MKR holder in the system? And anything that isn\u2019t following the regular governance process, so like actually trying to scientifically optimize the system and following the consensus of the community is always going to make people worse off because it breaks the fundamental social contract. And so this dynamic of like a blatant attack also works on sort of smaller levels. Because you know, it\u2019s not just that it\u2019s not just a dynamic where you know, you want to protect the system, from very powerful attacks, you also actually want to kind of like police and try to catch people from breaking the social contract and catch them in the act of doing something where the situation where the users most likely will most likely actually consider this behavior like like negligent or malicious to them and as a result have migrated to the system where the MKR actor is included because then you have this very strong dynamic right where people have to be very careful about carelessly track to push some proposal through that could actually get the shield system shutdown and maybe even get penalized for being responsible for it.Friederike: So there are two very significant updates coming to the Maker system soon. The first one is the interest generating DAI. Can you talk about what that is? And what made you roll that out?Rune: Yes, so the DAI savings rate which is what allows you to hold DAI and actually get a savings return on it as you hold it in your wallet for instance is a really fundamental feature because it\u2019s kind of the counterpart to the stability for you. So right now when the system is balanced you have like you can only change the stability fee and then you can modify the supply and then the down side of that is that that means that when the system really grows but the supply grows more than the demand your only option is to pull down on supply. So you kind of have to let the system become a victim of its own success and artificially restrain the growth of the system, which is what\u2019s happening right now where the stability fee is just incredibly high and it\u2019s actually really yeah, it is kind of crazy a lot of people commenting, you know, why are people even generating DAId when the fee is just that crazy high? And it\u2019s amazing to see the people still are using it but the problem is that the system has no way to spur DAI demand, there\u2019s no way to kind of like make it more attractive to hold DAI. And that\u2019s what the DAI savings rates solves. So instead of just pulling down on the stability fee side when the system is growing you can pull up on the demand side as well. So if you had like the mismatch like this, you can pull it in to sync here and actually see overall growth of the system. The actual effect of that in practice could very well be quite you know, quite a quantum leap in terms of hitting some sweet spots and product market fit where the system suddenly becomes interesting to a lot more people. Because on the one hand you get you get the the CDP functionality which is right now incredibly popular even with these ridiculously high fees, you can get that down like you can well rather you get because you can you can get that down to a much lower rate because you can now suddenly make DAI incredibly attractive because with a stability fee of 20% for instance on generating DAI, theoretically and I mean this is a this is a niche case like it wasn\u2019t wouldn\u2019t actually happen, but already there is a 20% like there\u2019s sort of 20% available to give to DAI holders. So imagine if holding DAI gave you a 20% return and it was without any additional risk whatsoever it was just like holding a regular DAI like it is gave you this massive return right? You would immediately see tons of people moving their savings into this because they would want to take advantage of that very high savings rate.Sunny: Quick question about this though about how this works doesn\u2019t isn\u2019t the stability fee paid in MKR and then the DAI savings rate would be accumulated in DAI. How does that work, the transition from the stability fee from MKR , does it have to go through some exchange or something to be paid out?Rune: The feature of the fee being paid directly in MKR in single collateral DAI it\u2019s kind of one of the features that we\u2019re in the end not done for any like business reason or any sort of user-facing reason but rather because it was easier to implement. So it was easier to get single level done and get the get the, you know system live and rolling and sort of see it play out in the real world.Sunny: But wasnt that deflationary aspect of MKR because the fee is burned also important to the economic design.Rune: Oh, yeah, absolutely. But the way it\u2019s going to be implemented in multi-level DAI is just a more like a better approach, which is that the system takes in fees and DAI and then what it does is it accumulates kind of a pool of DAI called a buffer and when the buffer hits a certain size it triggers what\u2019s called a surplus auction and the surplus auction is then where MKR is burnt and then what the means is that buffer is also available as kind of like an account where DAI can also be taken out of and put into the DAI savings rate for instance. And actually today you can also pay your stability fee with DAI because it is actually super frustrating and it was one of the biggest concerns all the users had that they had to let go and you know, they have to use Eth to open the CDP and then they get DAI the second token and then they also have to go and get a third token like some dust to then pay the fee to receive the collateral out of it, and it\u2019s just like incredibly, you know user unfriendly really and as a result the feature to pay the stability fee with DAI was added to the front end and kind of like means that it takes care of automatics to go and buy MKR and on exchange and then pay the stability fee for you, but that that convenience functionality is moved into the core of Maker in multi collateral DAI. So that also supports the DAI savings rate and is then fundamental to facilitating the DAI savings rate and the flows of money that that really go from from CDP holders paying the stability fee for you and then the part of that going to DAI holders and another part of it going to MKR holders.Sunny: What happens if people don\u2019t actually use this stability fee and so, you know, you promised the the locked DAI interest rate, but then it turns out there\u2019s not enough people actually, you know closing their CDP. And so you don\u2019t actually have the money, like is there other critiques concern here like, you know, what happened if you don\u2019t have the money to actually pay out the interest rates that were promised.Rune: Yeah, that would be if it used the current model where you pay all the fee at when you close the CP but in the next version of the system, they\u2019re counting as continuous. So you actually see the DAI, like rather than a CDP accruing you could say like a fee over time, this will sit there and has to be paid. What a CDP does in multi collateral DAI is it actually continuously generates more and more DAI. So it doesn\u2019t kind of like accumulate a fee you have to pay it just generates DAI on your behalf that is then sent to the buffer. So what that means is that it\u2019s just like the direct like when it is paid out, that DAI has been directly generated out of the CDP at that moment in time. So there\u2019s always like real-time solvency in the system because of course that\u2019s necessary or you could run into these weird edge cases.Friederike: That sounds like a very major upgrade. One thing I\u2019m curious about, so in my understanding to actually have your DAI generate interest you have to put it in a particular smart contract and only then does it generate interest. Why was that design decision made? Why don\u2019t you just have all DAI in existence generate interest or at least have a tokenized claim against that DAI in that smart contracts similar to what Compound is doing will C DAI because that would let people\u2019s not just have DAI sitting there but also let them be able to use it in dapps.Rune: Yes so the short answer is that it\u2019s for the sake of like use of friendliness because while it sounds great to always have it accumulating there might be many situations where for instance if you\u2019re trying to write a small app or you\u2019re trying to like create a smart contract or you\u2019re sending some amount or there could be a lot of situations where you just need to send an exact amount of money and you don\u2019t really care about getting some small savings for like, let\u2019s see a couple of days or a couple of hours or something.Sunny: Also I feel that there might be an issue here, you know, we\u2019ve had issues like this in design of Cosmos as well where it\u2019s like you don\u2019t want to iterate over all DAI holders every single time you want to pay out interest and the problem is, you know, okay, maybe you can pick it so you add it to a pool and what actually happened is DAI holders have shares in a pool, but then the problem is then DAI is not stable anymore and that defeated the whole point of what we were trying to do with creating the stable coins. So I am not sure how it would actually be possible to have it go to all DAI holders in a computationally efficient way.Friederike: And there are a lot of use cases where currently you\u2019re locking up DAI. So for instance say you\u2019ll use it in a prediction market as collateral for instance and you really wanted to be generating interest and don\u2019t you kind of push people into Compound and into using Compound DAI for this instead of interest and rating DAI.Rune: Yeah, I mean that could totally be a concern. But the thing is that it is actually implemented in a way where there is completely possible. So you would see you know, you would see let\u2019s say the prediction market implement on their end the like an integration where the moment you deposit DAI to the platform it\u2019s automatically sent into earning the DAI savings rate. And on top of that it is even technically possible to create this concept of the of the you know, the C DAI with the DSR where you actually can use the DAI directly in the DSR as tokens and the long-term vision is in fact that like one day far out in the future when the ecosystem is way more mature and the you know, the standards are able to handle this and collect the accounting systems and even the accountants can sort of wrap their heads around it, you would have all DAI in real time always generate the savings rate, because rationally, there\u2019s no reason to do it if it\u2019s if there\u2019s no friction in doing it, but the fact is just today if you try to force it on people it would like it would create more losses through friction and confusion that it would create the gains of like let\u2019s say, you know, like when you\u2019re sending DAI your friend instead of like pulling it out of the DAI savings rate, sending it to him and then a day later he puts it into the DAI savings rate, like sure you can still gain one day extra of interest earned by just sending it directly. But the problem is that what you then create is like a much bigger burden on the wallet to properly integrate and implement this so that\u2019s really that\u2019s the big trade-off in the beginning right that is actually simpler technically to deal with kind of this fixed idea of the DAI savings rate where you deposit your DAI and pull it out when you then want to send it around rather than you always have to account for the savings rate accumulating, because it is actually implemented in exactly the way you describe that it is this it is a share in like a pool. I mean that\u2019s a very rough and like very simplified explanation of it. But on the back end it doesn\u2019t actually change over time but the front end kind of updates the value so it looks like it\u2019s kind of like a transaction that\u2019s happening but in reality, it\u2019s really just kind of like numbers that\u2019s modified in you know, various ways, which is exactly actually how this stability fee works right now. So the stability fee doesn\u2019t actually update individually on every CDP. It just looks that way and in reality it\u2019s a single number called accumulator that\u2019s updating and then it\u2019s displayed across all CDP\u2019s when it gets updated.Sunny: Do you think that over time that you know currently what Maker DAO essentially is is this like decentralized central bank. Do you think that over time maybe there might be competitor to central banks that kind of compete with the Maker system and you know, maybe they claim that whatever their governance processes that they use might be better than what the Maker DAO system does. I think this is actually kind of what the Libra project from Facebook is kind of going down that route a little bit and so how do you think the Maker ecosystem will react to alternative decentral bank stable coin designs whether that, you know a copy of the Maker system with you know, different governance system or even a different system altogether, kind of more like The Reserve System, which uses, you know slightly different mechanics.Rune: Yeah, I always expected that we would see the copycats and competitors and similar types of systems much earlier, and it would really be this like big space and they would be just like a lot of different versions all competing and it\u2019s quite interesting that the reality ended up being that Maker pretty much became the only decentralized stable coin with decentralized governance and then the whole ecosystem of centralized stable coins is was what ended up completely exploding but you\u2019re totally right that the thing that that makes Maker DAO unique is a decentralized governance and the way that you would sort of have something that would actually be a competitor. They would actually operate in the same space as Maker would be by having a different type of decentralized governance that could somehow add add more to the table and be more efficient or better at managing risk or something like that. And I mean, I don\u2019t think that so far there\u2019s there\u2019s really nothing like it yet. I mean, there\u2019s no attempt at actually creating this type of self organizing and sustainable community that we are trying to bootstrap. And if you look at something like Libra for instance, I would say that like it is actually quite different So based on my not totally perfect understanding of Libra, it hasn\u2019t a bit more of kind of like a fixed monetary policy where it\u2019s collect predefined and based on the individual actions of of the participants in the in ecosystem. So it prioritizes liquidity as I see it, but it what it sacrifices is kind of like a coherent and unified monetary policy. So you end up having a collateral portfolio and you end up having an inflation rate and a peg that\u2019s a little bit more random because you\u2019re prioritizing this ability for anyone to always create them by pledging collateral into the system without any sort of framework to do that within. And I mean ultimately I think that\u2019s what is by far the most powerful because that\u2019s what thousands of years of traditional finances coalesce that and what you need to then do to make something that\u2019s better than Maker is you need to get better at still operating within that framework and kind of like setting that frame work correctly so that you do get this like optimal liquidity, optimal peg point ,optimal inflation and best risk management. The question is whether you can kind of like innovate on top of this idea of having token holders ultimately curating the decisions. Maybe there\u2019s something like paying for votes or rewarding activity or paying experts or something and all of these ideas is actually also something that Maker governance is very heavily focused on trying to innovate because of course, this is only the very beginning of decentralized governance.Friederike: Let\u2019s fast forward maybe 5 or 10 years. So you just added 6 tokens for multi collateral DAI. The choice of tokens are move to that exact 6 seconds makes me think this is the first of many additions to come. So basically if you look at the market cap of the 6 tokens that you are adding their only on the order of a few percent of what the Ethereum market cap is so the collateral that was already available, the last version of the system that was technically much simpler. What are you plans for expanding the scope of collateral. In 5 years, will I be able to use my house as collateral on Maker?Rune: Yeah, the short answer is that yes, that would absolutely be the dream that where the project is going is kind of trying to break beyond the boundaries of blockchain and crypto and to some extent the bubble that crypto still lives within but instead try to reach out to the real world and integrate with real financial system the real global trading system and most importantly have real assets and real value in the real world actually back DAI. So it\u2019s not just hot crypto air but it\u2019s I mean, which actually does have its own very unique benefits and very really unique risk characteristics. But ultimately you want as much diversification you want as many different perspectives and avenues of stability as you possibly can behind a stable coin. And there is actually some incredibly exciting and quite a fast-moving Innovation happening exactly within the space of like figuring out how do we make it so that 5 years is maybe a little bit optimistic, but potentially 5 years from now you can open an app on your phone and then you click a button and that app uses some sort of third party service to legally connect the ownership and the deed of your house to token which is then directly sent to some sort of automatic or automated, you know, risk assessment function that\u2019s connected to Maker that kind of like does an assessment of your house and the value of your house in the risk associated with that house and then ultimately creates a new CDP type unique to you and kind of like your house and your risk parameters and your sort of conditions as a debtor. And then ultimately you can deposit the token again with a single click on your app into Maker directly and generate DAI directly and go and maybe refinance your current loan or something like that with it. I mean that is certainly look very cyberpunk and very cool and a very concrete way that you could think like you could actually imagine that the mum and pups of the future would have blockchain directly in their face because that\u2019s how they would do their you know, their mortgages. But of course the steps along that way are most likely going to be a lot more about kind of integrating on the backend of existing financial infrastructures, so it\u2019s a tough stretch to take it to the end user and really make it like usable and accessible and powerful for the sort of the regular retail credit seeker. But it\u2019s a lot easier if you start trying to implement it to something like large-scale trade finance or even just like large-scale securities or bonds repo markets because there\u2019s so much institutional capture and luck in those platforms right now in those spaces and there\u2019s so much paperwork and bureaucracy and just like old thinking around it that it\u2019s it\u2019s you know, it\u2019s incredibly ripe for disruption by just a lot of technology.Friederike: Maybe let\u2019s end on this very cyberpunk notion. I think those are fantastic closing words. Thank you so much for being on the show. This was super interesting and I apologize to our listeners for going over a little bit. I hope you\u2019re all still here.Rune: Yeah. Sorry that happens quite often for me. That\u2019s the nature of Maker being so complicated.Friederike: Thank you.Rune: But thanks a lot for the great questions and great conversation.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Blockchain", "Bitcoin", "Fintech"]}, {"title": "Web 3.0+: The Hyperconnected Global Internet", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@jalak/web-3-0-the-hyperconnected-global-internet-5824ce6df86c?source=search_post", "author_name": "jalak jobanputra", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@jalak", "publish_date": "2011-07-18", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-12", "readtime": "4.35", "claps": 3, "voters": 1, "content": "Web 3.0+: The Hyperconnected Global Internetjalak jobanputraFollowJul 18, 2011 \u00b7 5 min readThe title of this blog comes from a presentation I did at last year\u2019s Web 2.0 conference in NYC, in September 2010. I overviewed the growth of the global internet and penetration, noting that the future of the Web was going to be driven by emerging countries, as mobile connectivity continues to be more ubiquitous and the West is largely penetrated. The slides are here:Jalak Jobanputra : Web 3.0 Globalization of the InternetWhile I haven\u2019t updated the numbers, if anything, the pace of adoption has accelerated. We also have the experience of the Arab Spring, Japan earthquake and, more recently, Occupy Wall Street in the past year to highlight how global the Web has become.That presentation marked the beginning of a year of travel for me. I\u2019ve been MIA on this blog because I\u2019ve traveled the world several times over during the past year meeting with, and investing in, entrepreneurs in emerging markets (20 hour flights, jetlag, numerous speaking engagements, constant meetings and bay area commutes made it challenging to write more than two coherent sentences together in anything other than an investment memo or a quick tweet!) I\u2019ll go into greater detail on each market, and what I invested in and am excited about, in subsequent posts. But as I settle back into NYC, and am surrounded once again by innovation happening in the US market, I am struck by how many learnings can, and need to, cross borders to tackle the problems the world faces today. We now have the components for this in place: infrastructure through the Internet, mobile connectivity in the hands of billions of people throughout the world, and social networks such as facebook and twitter and skype.Last week I attended a NYC screening of Tiffany Shlein\u2018s fantastic new documentary Connected which discusses a \u201cnew declaration of interdependence\u201d created by technology. I highly recommend everyone go see it. It is a nuanced, layered film. In one section, she describes how the human left brain (logical,analytical,looks at parts) and right brain (intuitive,creative,holistic,synthesizing) are forced to work together more in the connected, information overload, multitasking world we are now living in. She notes it is those people that can meld the two (and she uses the early example of Leonardo daVinci who synthesized these spheres more than most) that will be the leaders and problem solvers in this new world. In the Industrial age that swept across the West, the right brain was more valued, as machines and people specialized to create mass produced goods. On Wall Street, the right brain has been more valued, apparent in the ever thinner slicing of derivatives that resulted in the complete loss of perspective of their impact in the bigger economic picture. The Italian Renaissance, Gupta dynasty in India and Ming dynasty in China were periods of more balance between the logical and creative and resulted in stable, cultured societies which fostered much innovation across sectors. They key is balance, as specialization is also a necessary component to progress (ie, Intel\u2019s \u201cCopy Exactly\u201d strategy). To look at this on a more recent macro level there\u2019s a great article The Art of the Posse-able on the Philanthrocapitalism site, based on the book of the same name by Matt Bishop and Mike Green, which discusses interdisciplinary and group approaches to tackling global challenges such as malaria eradication.The importance of this connectivity applies to cities, individuals, companies, as well as nations and global causes. When I gave the opening keynote at NYC\u2019s first Entrepreneur Week in 2008, I noted that NYC\u2019s interdisciplinary nature and density (ie, easy connectivity) would be key in overcoming the economic downturn, and that technology would be the enabler and accelerator. We\u2019ve seen this play out in the disruption, and rebuilding of industries from media to retail (although unfortunately recovery has not reached everyone, and that\u2019s another post). On an investor panel a year later, I was asked what I look for in a company I\u2019m investing in, and while I agreed with colleagues on the importance of the size of the market, the team, etc, my answer differed slightly: I want to change the world and want companies I invest in to aim for the same. It is through supporting and investing in a portfolio of brilliant, passionate entrepreneurs who are building game changing businesses that potentially impact the lives of billions of people that I am able to leverage my own experiences to change the world more than I could on my own. The key is also connecting companies in my portfolio, creating those permanent and temporary \u201cposses\u201d discussed by Green and Bishop, to maximize impact. The sum of these connections and experiences, IF shared, is exponentially greater than any individuals or companies. In my last post I wrote about my own personal and career path, in which I have traversed disciplines, sectors and geographies instead of a linear progression (in opposition to the advice of many). While I did it do follow my own passions (which happen to cross my left and right brains) and my belief that every person needs to chart their own path and not blindly follow the status quo, there is no doubt that the resulting perspective is much richer and useful in today\u2019s world than a siloed one.When I attended a startup showcase in Jakarta, Indonesia this past July, I met a 17 year old high school student who came to me (in broken English) with 5 startup ideas, all of which had promise if developed in the right way. It is hard not to be wildly optimistic when I come across minds like that \u2014 but we must be open to crossing oceans, borders and disciplines to enable him and billions like him. We need to be connected. While there is much doom and gloom out there right now, I have been encouraged by the sharing of ideas and innovations that I\u2019ve seen from Brooklyn to Nairobi that are products of the hyperconnectivity that technology has enabled over the past few years.We have moved from a siloed, individualistic world to one that is hyperconnected and there is no return. We are interdependent. It is how we harness these connections, at personal, interpersonal and macro levels, that will determine individual happiness, progress, and global prosperity. We have all the tools we need to make it happen. In future posts I will highlight examples of how it\u2019s already happening \u2014 and would love examples from all of you!Posted: July 18th 2011Originally published at thebarefootvc.com on July 18, 2011.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Social Impact", "Emerging Markets", "Technology", "Entrepreneurship", "Globalization"]}, {"title": "Riflessione su Le Web 3: fisico o digitale?", "post_link": "https://medium.com/sketchin-it/riflessione-su-le-web-3-fisico-o-digitale-969e63382ee3?source=search_post", "author_name": "Sketchin", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@sketchin", "publish_date": "2007-12-17", "last_modified_date": "2016-09-11", "readtime": "1.53", "claps": 1, "voters": 1, "content": "Riflessione su Le Web 3: fisico o digitale?SketchinFollowDec 17, 2007 \u00b7 2 min readParigi, Le Web 3: quarta edizione del pi\u00f9 importante evento europeo dedicato al web.

Reid Hoffman and Tim O\u2019Reilly are smart guys, but why flog the Web 3.0 angle?Back a few years ago, Jason Calacanis tried to dub what he was doing at Mahalo as Web 3.0, and I wrote this:Personally, I feel the vague lineaments of something beyond Web 2.0, and they involve some fairly radical steps. Imagine a Web without browsers. Imagine breaking completely away from the document metaphor, or a true blurring of application and information. That\u2019s what Web 3.0 will be, but I bet we will call it something else.The new new deserves a good name. This new world arising from the collision of a number of semi-independent trends:social as the primary mode of human-computer interaction (meaning that human-human interaction is primary, not human to computer),ubiquitous connectivity,touch mobiles,and post-desktop, internet-based operating systems.So, I will start referring to this as SoCoMoIO (pronounced \u2018so-co-mo-eye-oh\u2019). But that\u2019s just shorthand, not a sweeping terminological handwave.And I think the meme of using ordinal numbers is generally tired, and never has caught on for any number past 2.0, anyway. By the time we get to what might realistically be a third generation, no one remembers what preceded 1.0.Whatever this new new winds up being called, I don\u2019t think it will be defined by mounds of data being pored over by algorithmic \u2018engines of meaning\u2019 (as Bruce Sterling said).The next decade will be defined by the enormous social leverage cracked open by SoCoMoIO: this will dwarf the the rise of the web to date, and it will make what we are doing today look like the foothills overshadowed by the Rockies.But no one will call it Web 3.0.So Is Web 3.0 Already Here? \u2014 Sarah Lacey", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Reid Hoffman", "Social", "Socomoio"]}, {"title": "", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@Threecatspitbull/web-3-0-is-here-ea0364b56b0d?source=search_post", "author_name": "Jack Stemmelin", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@Threecatspitbull", "publish_date": "2018-06-21", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-21", "readtime": "2.68", "claps": 1, "voters": 1, "content": "Jack StemmelinFollowJun 21, 2018 \u00b7 3 min readWeb 3.0 is here! The only question is if your business is ready or if you will be left behind playing catch-up in 2019.But before talk about Web 3.0, or as I call it \u201cWeb 3D\u201d it\u2019s important to understand Web 1.0 and 2.0. Here\u2019s a very condensed history plus some anecdotes of my experience with the Internet and why I have immersed myself in this fascinating technology. This part 1 of 3.Web 1.0 officially started our worldwide obsession with connecting ourselves with our world with the creation of ARPANET. According to Wikipedia \u201cARPANET adopted TCP/IP on January 1, 1983, and from there researchers began to assemble the \u201cnetwork of networks\u201d that became the modern Internet. The online world then took on a more recognizable form in 1990, when computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web\u201d. That\u2019s approximately when \u201cwww\u201d started showing up and the dot com boom, (and collapse) happened.Back in 1983 all webpages were information storage, collaboration or sharing. Web pages were static and did not change without the webmaster making a change. Wikipedia defined a Static Website as follows: A static website contains Web pages with fixed content. Each page is coded in HTML and displays the same information to every visitor. Static sites are the most basic type of website and are the easiest to create. Unlike dynamic websites, they do not require any Web programming or database design.Web 2.0 came about 1999 but wasn\u2019t a software update like iOS or Windows has us do, rather it was the way a browser interacted with the web server, rendering the experience INTERACTIVE. Mostly this was done with databases (but there were some exceptions irrelevant here).In simplest terms Web 2.0 gave us DYNAMIC web pages like eLearning sites, eCommerce, data warehouses and storage connecting people and systems across the world with peers, suppliers, customers and INFORMATION.I was lucky enough to be there in 1999 working at XANDO Cosi (now just called Cosi) as an information analyst. We didn\u2019t use the Internet to connect our stores, rather we used a frame relay network. But it\u2019s exactly the same thing using routers and TCP/IP to share information. At XANDO we \u201cpolled\u201d our restaurant 5 times daily and made the sales information available to everyone. More metrics than I could figure out how to use were assembled and stored by our Aloha Enterprise system.I was the gatekeeper to the Aloha Enterprise Data Warehouse and Oracle. I also built one of the very first RESTAURANT corporate portals to operational information. My job description was to bridge these two worlds. Financial information that helped our executives and managers monitor and make ACTIONABLE operational decisions. We spent well over a MILLION dollars on our technology.Believe it or not but Web 3.0 or Web3D started with Pok\u00e9mon and Microsoft Kinect. I wish I was making that up but Pok\u00e9mon was the first example of Augmented Reality. According to Wikipedia Kinect used the Prime Sense sensors and is a line of motion sensing input devices that was produced by Microsoft for Xbox 360 and Xbox One video game consoles and Microsoft Windows PCs. Apple bought Prime Sense and continues to operate the business.I didn\u2019t play these games until Matterport put the Prime Sense sensors into a structure scanner originally used for real estate. Actually I bought a Matterport Pro 1 camera to become a Matterport Service Partner. I have since purchased two additional cameras.Actually it took me SIX MONTHS to come up with the $6,000 I needed to start my business 360\u00b0 3D World. The reason I decided to sell my other business (and later emptied my savings account) is EVERYONE big in software or and hardware released a AR/VR toolkit\u2019s, allowing us to build API\u2019s, or advanced programming interface. Apple, google, Samsung are just a few of the business that like I, invested heavily in the AR/VR potential.To find out what my team at 360\u00b0 3D World is doing with AR/VR you have to come back for part 2. Although we started with million dollar listings on Chicago\u2019s Gold Coast, we have since added partners and technicians to meet the needs of almost any business who can use AR/VR to achieve results.", "responses": 1, "tags": ["Virtual Reality", "Business", "Creativity", "Education", "Science"]}, {"title": "J\u00f6nne a web 3.0?", "post_link": "https://medium.com/doransky/j%C3%B6nne-a-web-3-0-e230b0519962?source=search_post", "author_name": "Doransky", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@doransky", "publish_date": "2006-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2018-01-08", "readtime": "0.57", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "J\u00f6nne a web 3.0?DoranskyFollowNov 12, 2006 \u00b7 1 min readMajdnem biztos, hogy nem.

First of all, there were by far enough power plugs for laptops in the conference room itself, which was amazing. The event location was very good all in all and this time, I have to say that for dealing with 1000 people, food was very good indeed. Both of those were large complaints of the last events and they have been fixed.The total group of people that was there was a very good mix, and in light of the basic idea having come from an un-conference, the networking was very good. And this is actually a large part of what an un-conference is about for me. There were also some real highlights in the talks like Hans or the second life panel.

Although some are just now getting comfortable with these tactics, others are already looking toward the horizon for what\u2019s next. Web 3.0 is coming quickly and it will potentially put the trust we\u2019ve built with our consumers at risk. To effectively realize the full potential of Web 3.0, we must protect and foster that trust as a sacred commodity.Although still ambiguous, some describe Web 3.0 as an enormous social network that connects information instead of people. It will ideally allow for incredibly complex queries that provide results based on your likes and dislikes determined through past Internet usage.WebMD\u2019s founder Jeff Arnold and talk show host Dr. Mehmet Oz recently introduced the new site Sharecare which exemplifies the potential Web 3.0. As somewhat of a Facebook-meets-WebMD, this new health care platform allows consumers to ask questions directly on the site and receive answers from physicians from top institutions such as Johns Hopkins and \u201cKnowledge Partners\u201d. The paid sponsorship line-up includes inaugural partner, Dove, who will provide insight on skin care.With Dove clearly labeled as a sponsor, we assume that today\u2019s discerning consumer is able to recognize that sponsors are paying to provide content, thus allowing the consumer to make appropriate purchasing decisions based on that knowledge. However, as we move down the path into Web 3.0, such recognition may become increasingly more difficult. Marketers will be able to seamlessly integrate themselves into the user experience, making it harder for consumers to objectively discern between information and advertising.There are two key implications of this Internet evolution: privacy and trust. Privacy has emerged as a priority consumer concern in the digital age. One marketing misstep sparks widespread consumer outrage. Not only do consumers want to feel secure that their payment information won\u2019t be accessible to others over the Internet, they also want to feel they haven\u2019t been deceived by the marketer. Building trust, therefore, is critical to achieving the necessary transparency to create a positive consumer experience. While Web 3.0 may open up scores of opportunities for consumers as the Internet increasingly serves as a \u201cpersonal assistant\u201d, we can\u2019t forget the importance of the reaching consumers on a personal level.Web 3.0 will rely on technologies far more complicated than can be discussed in this venue, and the \u201cpersonal assistant\u201d that it could become is in some ways just a series of scientific formulas that spit out results. Consumers are inherently leery of an entirely automated process. In order to trust, consumers must know that a marketer is speaking to them personally. Recognizing this, Sharecare has successfully leveraged the traditional WebMD model and a social networking platform that creates a dialogue between consumers and trusted physicians and institutions as well as marketers. As the site continues to develop and expand its Knowledge Partners, it is critical that consumers don\u2019t feel that marketers are preying on them in a time of weakness, thus making it imperative that Sharecare maintains enough transparency that consumers can trust the site as a valued information source in addition to a trusted purchase influencer.So, let this serve as a cautionary message to marketers for the future. Sharecare has led the way toward Web 3.0 wisely. Web 3.0 presents a host of unprecedented opportunities, but in pursuing them we must remember the adage that attention, like friendship, must be earned. Ultimately, we must remember who we\u2019re serving and earn their friendship through that service.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Privacy", "Technology", "Trust"]}, {"title": "Growth Driven Design \u2014 Re imagining Web 3.0", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@360IE/growth-driven-design-re-imagining-web-3-0-9432d6f96735?source=search_post", "author_name": "AD 360 \ud83d\udef5", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@360IE", "publish_date": "2018-03-23", "last_modified_date": "2018-03-23", "readtime": "4.51", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "Growth Driven Design \u2014 Re imagining Web 3.0AD 360 \ud83d\udef5FollowMar 23, 2018 \u00b7 5 min readGrowth Driven Design \u2014 Re imagining Web 3.0Is it now possible to put all of this online, in a form that is accessible to everyone on your team?

Information has become the core substance for part of this population. The challenge for web 3.0 lies in the relationship between the control of information and timeless human interaction.Web 1.0 and 2.0 define structural stages in the the conquest of the \u2018grail\u2019 and immortality. Little by little human relationships have changed, becoming increasingly virtual. Now interaction is more seamless and online information leaves an indelible footprint. Like a child learning to walk we have stumbled (the first bank card fraud, our personal information is available online, the 2001 crisis and the dot com bubble bursting\u2026) but also we have matured (creating virtual bank cards, learning to configure privacy settings, and building a renewed economy\u2026). From the ashes of our mistakes the phoenix rises, in this case, due to the clicks of internet users.Using what we have learned from the previous stages, with Web 3.0 we\u2019ll continue to learn and manage it. At last the professional world is starting to integrate online and grow like an emerging country, looking to develop its economy rapidly.This New World explores new horizons: social networks have become \u2018professional\u2019 tools. LinkedIn and Viadeo were the first of their kind to who knew how to educate internet users about the development of their 3.0 Identity. The traditional relationship, that until now limited itself to clubs, associations and closed groups, has expanded into a completely open network capable of interacting with the whole of the internet sphere.From your first connection, you are integrated online, creating your online presence (albeit incomplete at first). Discovering this new virtual space, which until now was unknown to us, we quickly go looking for our online identity.Regardless of your professional circle, recognizable websites will boost your online learning such as certain sectors (finance, marketing\u2026) or familiar logos (businesses and schools).Quickly, you become part of an interconnected world that is integrated across different channels. A frenetic race against the clock that starts by integrating and developing your 3.0 profile. Search engines index new profiles building your e-reputation and e-respectability.This virtuous cycle allows you to make new contacts, join social groups, share information and skills, and endorse people. Like Facebook, who knew very well how to capture a young and dynamic audience, professional social networks are starting a become more open in terms of \u201cProfessional Relationships.\u201dWeb 3.0 allows you to upload your old address books to sync with your smartphone, tablet or your smart PC. With just a click, professionals can find contact details of their connections and can instantly start a videoconference.Expertise has become extremely easy to share across all channels: blogs, social networks, idea-sharing media and communication tools.

Except one or two very bad experiences, which I will go into later later, it was one of the best conferences I have been to. This is probably only due to the people that have been there, and not for the talks, even though there were some good ones. Being part of the blogging echo chamber, I cannot expect for all the talks to be something new though.But let\u2019s start at the beginning. I arrived Sunday afternoon and while the trip was planned with Henning he had to call in sick and was sweating in bed under fever while I was overlooking the Seine from my room.Having planned to go to the pre-conference dinner I left the hotel for a quick stroll to the Eifel tower, which you see in my previous post, and joined a great group of people in the Entrepot in Paris. We even had music.Next to the usual people I had a great chat with Jacob Share of Share select Media who organized us the space to hold the meeting and was constantly apologizing because we couldn\u2019t order food a la carte, but only from a menu. No sweat Jacob, I had already eaten anyway. ;)I also Tom Neumann from Liquid Air Lab, who are doing Spodradio among others. I really have to check out that mobile podcasting client. They have some great things planned for the company and I am sure some interesting times ahead, especially with the backing they have. An intense talk was with Ewan Spence, who does All About Symbian and The Podcast Network as well as a system of virtual role playing cards for Second Life. Yes, virtual cards. He was part of a pannel on Tuesday and I have to admit, that the pannel, which was one of the best, opened my eyes a little bit more to the power of virtual worlds for socializing. I had already understood that there are little better prototyping environments than second life for a virtual card game. :) If you have have a chance to speak to Ewan, do so. Full steam ahead.Next Ingmar arrived and we headed back to the hotel, where we met Mario Sixtus, who prepared us for the fact that Le Web 3 was no longer a small conference (which we knew) but a full blown conference with press rooms and a media agency. This actually was a bit weird from time to time, because for example, there were a few comedians running around the event that didn\u2019t fit at all, and they even interrupted Loic\u2019s opening remarks.One of the clear highlight, for anyone you talked to, was Hans Rosling. He IS positively amazing. You understand the power of globalization, the power of statistics, and the power of visualization. On top of that, he is just, again, very intense. He grabs you and pulls you into his world. What this video of his talk at Ted this year. It is especially interesting to see the reason behind the change in demographics, like clean water changing life expectancy dramatically, and reflecting on the situation in \u201cthird world\u201d countries by thinking what the conditions were in e.g. Germany when your grand grand parents were born and then taking a look at a country today with a similar life expectancy today.He also had great views on opening all university lectures when those are paid by taxes, and some other great things. Whenever you have the chance to see him talk, go go go!Next up for me was a presentation of Ormigo in the start-up room, which took a mere 6 or 7 minutes I think and resulted in silence in the room. Thankfully one of the judges asked some, good, questions. Right when I went back to my seat, I got the first business card of a VC that wanted to chat in the next few days, and on wednesday the exact same judge that asked the questions came back to me, asking for my card to be able to have a chat because he was interested as well. Now those were productive 7 minutes ;)The day ended with a great dinner, at a wonderful parisian restaurant, organized by Andrew Carlton from Treonauts, where we had some very good discussions about goals in life, technology, design, advertising, blogging, and who would have guessed, Hans Rosling. The woman sitting almost opposite of me (sorry, but I never asked for your card, even though I should have, to good a conversation) actually rode with him in the train it seems and Hans said that she seems to be similarly crazy as he is and hence they would get along wonderfully, which they did.Then we headed for the party and after a long time in the queue to give up my coat, I had a good, but short time there. Having a meeting at 8:30 ment that I wanted to be in bed not too late. Sadly, it took me 1 hour to get my coat back, among others because the ticketnumber wasn\u2019t on the coat anymore. Then it took a long time to get a cab, and I ended up needing 2 hours from deciding to leave the party to being in bed. Ah well\u2026 4 and a half hours of sleep are plenty.My head was rumbling anyway because I had so many good talks with people during the entire day. They are too numerous to list here really, but suffice to say that the crowd that was there, made the event worth while. What would be good for next time though, would be if you could kind of put some device in your pocket that would vibrate if you were near somebody you wanted to meet, because half of the time you don\u2019t recognize them.After a very good meeting on tuesday morning I arrived at the conference around 12 and was greeted with people on stage I had no clue whatsoever who they were. This actually was Fran\u00c3\u00a7ois Bayrou, one of the presidential candidates in france who had shown up on short notice. Before that, right at the start, Simon Perez had actually been there, whom I will have to watch on video. I was told he was great, and had good interaction with the crowd.While the appearance of Fran\u00c3\u00a7ois Bayrou was unexpected, he seemed to be not taking himself to serious, and actually talked in english a lot of the time, or even translated the french of Loic himself. It was actually fun seeing the entire gang on stage switch heavily between two languages. I am happy to see though that france has a politician that can come into a dangerous crowd like this and open up for questions. But \u2026 at the same time, he had nothing to do there, because it was not a place to do a political rally. Thankfully he didn\u2019t seem to take it as such but more as a place to see if his ideas resonate.That directly brings me to the worst part of the conference though, which has to be talked about. Loic was very happy that the presidential candidate that he is backing was also bound to appear around 2pm but you noticed already that the crowd was getting a bit agitated about it. I admit, I wouldn\u2019t have mind to see one or two more panels instead of hearing politicians in France talk. A political panel, sure, but \u2026 back on key. The bad thing about Nikolas Sarkozy coming was that first of all, the entire hall was closed off and searched with dogs, police was everywhere, and so was security. Guess who the security is in this picture from his talk.The first row of people was cleared, and a special line was drawn in front of the crowd which was removed shortly before his arrival, to make believe that they are open. Amazing. The entire place was suddenly packed with media, cameras everywhere. Then Nikolas Sarkozy and introduced by Loic, went to stage, to the podium and started talking in french.Sure, there were translators available, but it\u2019s an international conference and you don\u2019t do it in french. DLD isn\u2019t in German either. There was even a stenographer present, fun to watch by the way ;)The thing that freaked me out most though is that the guy talked for 15 minutes, obviously trying to attract the interest of the more than 60 VCs in the room (that had probably already left), said thank you, and left. Just left. No questions whatsoever. I can understand french, so it\u2019s ok, and I sat next to Richard Wilkinson and Bruno de Penanster who thankfully gave me a bit of background info, which was good, but you don\u2019t have somebody go on stage for a conference which is all about interaction with the audience and not have the answer questions. Fran\u00c3\u00a7ois Bayrou did it too! It worked! That\u2019s a 100% nogo. The blogosphere is on fire about this at the moment.Le Web is actually at a cross road now. It was a bigger un-conference with les blogs 1, and now is a full blown conference. You either go with the un-conference character, which it no longer was, sorry Loic, or you really open it up to speeches. Speeches won\u2019t work, more diversity might, but only if there is somehow an option to connect with the people on stage. And seriously, for real diversity, DLD will eat your lunch.

Chief among them will be RDF and the technologies of the emerging Semantic Web. While Web 3.0 is not synonymous with the Semantic Web (there will be several other important technology shifts in that period), it will be largely characterized by semantics in general.Web 3.0 is an era in which we will upgrade the back-end of the Web, after a decade of focus on the front-end (Web 2.0 has mainly been about AJAX, tagging, and other front-end user-experience innovations.) Web 3.0 is already starting to emerge in startups such as my own Radar Networks, but will really become mainstream around 2010.I have to say that I would like to play with Spivack\u2019s new shiny Twine app, independently of the Web 3.0 mumbo jumbo.Pointer from Richard McManus, who is also unmoved by the Web 3.0 psychobabble:I should note that Nova\u2019s definition of web 3.0 is self-serving, because his new product Twine is an \u201cintelligent web\u201d product that uses semantics. Also I am not a proponent of continuing the version numbers \u2014 just as \u2018dot com\u2019 is the term for the first era of the Web, and \u2018web 2.0\u2019 the second, there will be a new term that bubbles up at the right time to describe the next era (perhaps 2\u20133 years from now).The people that will invent new stuff that will leapfrog Web 2.0\u2019s social revolution will not be web 2.0 retreads, but radical newbies: five girls in a rock band in an Illinois high school now, or some guy in South Korea working on 3D games, or a loose collective of Estonian graphic designers that invent a composite document metaphor.

I like Stowe Boyd\u2019s musings on the subject:Personally, I feel the vague lineaments of something beyond Web 2.0, and they involve some fairly radical steps. Imagine a Web without browsers.

You can read his entire rundown here: Today\u2019s Web 3.0 Nonsense Blogstorm. I won\u2019t bother quoting any of it since you really need to just read the whole thing.The first time I heard anyone mention the term \u201cWeb 3.0\u201d was when Jeffrey Zeldman schooled all the amateurs (including myself) with his article at A List Apart. At the time I considered it the most important article yet for the whole web industry and I still haven\u2019t found many others that compare. If you haven\u2019t read it, you should go back and do so. I\u2019ll wait.What bothers me about the latest hype, backlash, and level-headed discussion over this (insipid) label and whatever it may try to define is simply this: everyone is trying to shoehorn this term onto some idea of what the future holds for the web, and regardless of what that idea may be, it always has something to do with whatever company or venture that person is currently involved in. Don\u2019t believe me?Nova Spivack thinks web 3.0 will be \u201cthe Semantic Web or what we call it, \u2018the Intelligent Web.\u2019\u201d His company, Radar Networks, is pioneering it, or at least he claims.Jason Calacanis says, \u201cWeb 3.0 is defined as the creation of high-quality content and services produced by gifted individuals using Web 2.0 technology as an enabling platform.\u201d He calls this his \u201cofficial definition.\u201d It conveniently fits his venture, Mahalo.Google CEO Eric Schmidt says web 3.0 will be \u201capplications which are pieced together \u2014 relatively small, the data is in the cloud, can run on any device (PC or mobile), very fast, very customizable, and distributed virally (social networks, email, etc).\u201d This is a very nice way to look at Google\u2019s suite of web apps, which can share data, be accessed from any device, etc. etc.Tim Berners-Lee says, \u201cI think maybe when you\u2019ve got an overlay of scalable vector graphics \u2014 everything rippling and folding and looking misty \u2014 on Web 2.0 and access to a semantic Web integrated across a huge space of data, you\u2019ll have access to an unbelievable data resource.\u201d SVG is a W3C recommendation and the semantic web is a goal of other W3C recommendations (RDF, etc).Jerry Yang, founder and chief of Yahoo!, says, \u201cWeb 2.0 is well documented and talked about. The power of the Net reached a critical mass, with capabilities that can be done on a network level. We are also seeing richer devices over last four years and richer ways of interacting with the network, not only in hardware like game consoles and mobile devices, but also in the software layer. You don\u2019t have to be a computer scientist to create a program. We are seeing that manifest in Web 2.0 and 3.0 will be a great extension of that, a true communal medium\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6the distinction between professional, semi-professional and consumers will get blurred, creating a network effect of business and applications.\u201d Yahoo! is a big player in the mobile devices arena, and more importantly, is a big player in the \u201caverage user as developer/mashup-creator\u201d with their Pipes service.Reed Hastings, founder and CEO of Netflix, says \u201cWeb 1.0 was dial-up, 50K average bandwidth, Web 2.0 is an average 1 megabit of bandwidth and Web 3.0 will be 10 megabits of bandwidth all the time, which will be the full video Web, and that will feel like Web 3.0.\u201d 10 megabits of bandwidth all the time means a good market for a video-download-rental service. Also notice the term \u201cvideo Web.\u201dGary Hayes writes that web 3.0 will be \u201cthe real time collaborative web (3D, isometric or just 2D),\u201d emphasizing details like 3D portals, avatar representation, and virtual worlds. He is \u201ccurrently building and devising commercial and game-like services for virtual worlds, having recently produced and built both Australian Telstra and ABC Second Life presences in Second Life as Head of Virtual Worlds with the UK based Project Factory,\u201d plus some other details on his About page.APC Magazine said Mozilla is working on web 3.0 in reference to their efforts towards \u201cweb apps that will run in your browser without an internet connection.\u201d This is Mozilla\u2019s big focus as competition with proprietary technologies such as AIR and Silverlight.And Tim O\u2019Reilly is condemning the whole mess because now that the term is tainted, he can\u2019t make a conference about it.I\u2019ve gone through the trouble of putting all these quotes in one place so that I can make one thing clear: nobody has any agreement on what web 3.0 actually means, unless it happens to be what they themselves are working on. Everyone is basically jumping at the perceived opportunity to capitalize on the strength of a meme by saying, \u201clook here, web 3.0 is exactly what I am working on, and that is all it will be. I\u2019m calling huge BS on every one of them (and probably burning a few bridges as I go).As they did years ago with web 2.0 when Flock landed and Arrington was a rising star, nobody is actually addressing the real meat of what will define web 3.0 (or whatever we call it, doesn\u2019t matter). Google has always been a great tool but what made it real was the discovery that you can put ads on search results (and apply the same algorithms to an ad network, redefining advertising altogether). Blogging took off when people realized it was incredibly effective (and cheap) as a marketing tool and some individuals/companies made it their core business. YouTube became a workable model when companies took notice of the attention it was getting and started paying to attract that attention. MySpace was no big deal until the record industry saw that social interaction helped record sales and big media took interest in the user network. And now Facebook is the talk of the town because you can put little ads on applications and turn gift-giving and outlandish narcissism into a respectable CPM. Web 2.0 was not a revival of geeks thinking of new ways to use technology to do X or Y; they were always there, coding like monkeys and chatting over coffees and beers. Web 2.0 was a mass revival of business interest in the web, and it was a change that fed itself, as more business interest means more funds to support the geeks who code and chatter. After all, Web 1.0 was characterized by business interest that drove the \u201cweb as new commerce\u201d model, and the bust that followed was a direct result of businesses, not geeks, realizing that they couldn\u2019t make quite as much money as they thought and bailing out. Now they have realized that they can make quite a lot of money, even if they still exaggerate.So I\u2019ll say it again just as I said it before. Web 3.0 is about money. It hasn\u2019t even happened yet but that is what it will be about. It is the market value, not \u201ccoolness\u201d or \u201cusefulness,\u201d that decides which ideas will succeed or fail. If you still don\u2019t believe me, take a look at the failures. Skype was going to redefine the entire telephone industry by challenging the phone companies, but a failure to monetize is killing it. I\u2019m sure you could think of more examples.Looking at it from another angle, however, you could say that I\u2019m really just stating the obvious and looking at it the wrong way; the money follows the intrinsic value instead of defining it. That may be true, but to convince me of that you have to convince me that every valuable idea has been profitable, and every profitable idea was valuable. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true (by far).So how can I accurately describe this whole dissertation visually? In my previous post I used sheep to demonstrate my point:Web 1.0 was mostly benign, until it took off with the advent of e-commerce and the sheep-shearers were aggressively trying to attract the sheep, sometimes scaring them away with their overuse of shipping costs, spam, blinking text, and cookies. For the most part, sheep felt slighted and abused, and the shearers eventually gave up when they hadn\u2019t harvested enough wool. Web 2.0 was when the shearers came back with new ways of attracting sheep, though with the same intentions as in the web 1.0 days. The sheep, however, fell for these new methods and gave up their wool willingly, feeling entirely comfortable with their shearers and occasionally even Swedish. Of course, a lot of wool is never enough and web 3.0 will be marked by more advanced methods by which the shearers will be able to reach out and mine, scrape, and combine massive amounts of wool from multiple sheep-nodes in highly robust ways across multiple platforms, solidifying the wool-retrieval paradigm and laying down the foundation for distributed wool manipulation, making it possible for shearers to collaboratively network their shearing efforts and make the entire shearnet equally omnipresent and invisible. We won\u2019t really know it, however, until we see the flow of wool increase by orders of magnitude, and when that happens Tim will berate us for calling it web 3.0, so I\u2019ve already done everyone a favor by suggesting a number of alternatives. Whatever we settle on, let\u2019s just be honest with each other and admit that we do it for the money. Or the wool. I confuse myself, but this illustration should help:Disclaimer: I am hoping you will give me some counter-credibility here, since I\u2019m currently very low on both wool & methods for acquiring it :)", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Flock It"]}, {"title": "Messze m\u00e9g a web 3", "post_link": "https://medium.com/doransky/messze-m%C3%A9g-a-web-3-208b9ca0b88d?source=search_post", "author_name": "Doransky", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@doransky", "publish_date": "2007-07-18", "last_modified_date": "2017-05-14", "readtime": "1.2", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "Messze m\u00e9g a web 3DoranskyFollowJul 18, 2007 \u00b7 2 min readAmikor a web kett\u0151 berobbant a k\u00f6ztudatba \u00e9s a legfontosabb fejleszt\u00e9sek megjelentek nagyon sok kritika \u00e9rkezett azzal kapcsolatban, hogy a kettes v\u00edvm\u00e1nyok m\u00e1r \u00e9vek \u00f3ta jelen vannak.

And you are there, not knowing what exactly to do and how everything works together.If this is the first article that you read on Ethereum or the blockchain eco-system in general, you are going to love it! Experts calling each others names on twitter, unsafe standards and protocols, untested and buggy development tools. Not everything is figured out yet, everyone is going in different directions, and there still a lot to be done. The future of institutions, banks, and governments is being decided by mad developers! It\u2019s so great.Anyway, don\u2019t worry anymore, I\u2019ll try to connect all the dots for you in this tutorial series, and walk you through the universe of Smart contracts and dapps developement, and show you how everything fits together.While I will not get into every detail, I\u2019ll link some materials that will help you understand some concepts better, and it\u2019s up to you to research them and get into all the little details. The goal of this series is to help you understand better how things work together, in the simplest way possible, like a friend would explain it to you.I don\u2019t even know what Ethereum isThe official website of Ethereum tells us this:Ethereum is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts: applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third-party interference.In other words, it uses the capabilities that gives us the blockchain technology to certify the execution of the code that we run.If you don\u2019t know what the blockchain, Ethereum, Bitcoin, cryptocurrency or any of these words mean, I advise you to listen to this excellent podcast by Tim Ferriss, interviewing Nick Szabo and Naval Ravikant: The Quiet Master of Cryptocurrency \u2014 Nick SzaboWhat are Smart Contracts?On Ethereum, Smart Contracts are scripts that can handle money. It\u2019s as simple as that.These contracts are enforced and certified by parties that we call miners. Miners are multiple computers who add a transaction (Execution of a smart contract, payment of a cryptocurrency etc.) to a public ledger that we call a block. Multiple blocks constitute a blockchain.We pay these miners with something called Gas, which is the cost to run a contract. When you publish a smart contract, or execute a function of a smart contract, or transfer money to another account, you pay some ether that gets converted into gas.If it\u2019s still unclear, or you want to know more details, here are some interesting links:A different introduction to Smart Contracts in video.Smart contracts page on Wikipedia.A more detailed explanation of Gas.Before diving into smart contracts developmentIn this tutorial, I\u2019ll assume that you already have some basis in software development, and have a basic knowledge of Javascript and Node.JS. Otherwise, you\u2019ll be quickly lost. Solidity, the programming language that we will use to develop, is close to Javascript\u2019s syntax, and since a lot of development tools around Ethereum are based on Javascript and NodeJS, it will be easier for you to get in if you are already comfortable with both. This is not a tutorial for beginners, and while I\u2019ll link some alternative tutorials for you if you didn\u2019t understand some concepts, it\u2019s up to you to research the rest.Smart contracts developmentNow, finally, we start the interesting part, as I said Solidity is close to Javascript, but they are not alike. On Solidity, and I\u2019m sorry to tell you that, frontend developer, you just can\u2019t slap JQuery on a piece of code and hope that it will work, you can\u2019t overlook security, and you just can\u2019t hack your way through. We will see why when we will discuss security, development patterns, and fail-proofing our code.Now, for our first example, I\u2019m thinking about a script inspired by the movie In Time, where, in a dystopian future, people trade their remaining time to live like money. In the movie, they have a variant of arm wrestling that involves playing with that time, and we will do just that! Wrestling money using a Smart Contract.And don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll make available for you all the scripts we will see on Github.Also, if it\u2019s the first time you deal with smart contracts, it\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t understand everything now, it takes practice, reading the docs, and a bit of research to get accustomed to Solidity.The codeNow, onto the coding, first of all, the base of a Solidity script is the following snippet, the pragma directive to tell the compiler which version of Solidity we are using, and the name of our contract, a similar structure to a class in Javascript. Here it\u2019s \u201cWrestling\u201d.We want two wrestlers, so we will add two variables that hold the address of their accounts (Public keys of their wallets).In our little game, in each round, the wrestlers will be able to put in a sum of money, and if one put in double the money of the other(in total), he will win.One important thing about the public/private keywords is, even though, a variable is private, it doesn\u2019t mean that someone couldn\u2019t read its content, it just means that it can be accessed only inside the contract, but in reality, since the whole blockchain is stored on a lot of computers, the information that is stored inside the variable could always be seen by others, and that represents the first security consideration that you should keep in mind.On the other hand, the compiler automatically creates getter functions for public variables. To make it possible for other contracts or users to change the value of the public variable, you need to create a setter function.Now we will add three events, for every step of our game. The beginning, when the wrestlers register, during the game, for each round, and at the end, when a wrestler wins. Events are simply logs, and they can be used to call JavaScript callbacks in the user interface of distributed applications, also known as dapps. Events can even be used for debugging purposes during development since there is no equivalent to the \u201cconsole.log()\u201d function of JavaScript on Solidity.Now we will add the constructor, in Solidity, it has the same name as our contract and it will be called only once, upon the creation of the contract.Here, the first wrestler will be the one who created the contract. \u201cmsg.sender\u201d is the address of the one who invoked the function.Next we let another wrestler register with the following function:The require function is a special error-handling function within Solidity that will revert changes if a condition is not met. In our example, if the variable wrestler2 equals the 0x0 address (the equivalent of 0 for addresses), we can proceed, if the address wrestler2 is different from the 0x0 address, it means that a player has already registered as an opponent, and therefore, we will refuse new registrations.Again, \u201cmsg.sender\u201d is the address of the account that called the function, and we emit an event that signals the start of the wrestling.Now, every wrestler will call a function, \u201cwrestle()\u201d, putting in money. And if both have played, we see if one of them has won (our rule was that one of them have to put in double the cash of the other one). The \u201cpayable\u201d keyword means that the function can receive money, if it isn\u2019t set, the function will not accept ether. The \u201cmsg.value\u201d is the amount of ether that was sent to the contract.We then add the endOfGame(), and endOfRound() functions. The \u201cinternal\u201d keyword is the same as private, the only difference is that internal functions could be inherited by other contracts(since Solidity is similar to other object-oriented languages), while private functions cannot be inherited.Notice that we don\u2019t deliver the money to the winner directly, while in this case it\u2019s not that important, since the winner will take all the money off this contract, in other cases, when multiple users can withdraw ether off a contract, it\u2019s more secure to use a withdraw pattern, to avoid re-entrancy.It simply means, that if for example multiple users can withdraw money off a contract, one can simply call the withdraw function multiple times at once and get payed multiple times. So we need to write our withdraw function in such a manner that it will nullify the amount he should receive before proceeding to pay him.It looks like this:And that\u2019s it.

But this is just the beginning. As blockchain systems continue to evolve and scale, one great way to dip into this new space and leverage this technology is with decentralized applications, otherwise known as dApps.CryptoKitties, famous for its congestion of the Ethereum Blockchain, is a great example of a dApp, uniquely combining concepts of breedable and collectible cats with the blockchain. This sensational game is just one creative example out of a virtually unlimited number of opportunities.Although seemingly very complicated, certain frameworks and tools have been developed to abstract your interactions with the blockchain and smart contracts. In this blog post, I will go over one way to create a decentralized voting app on Ethereum. I will briefly go over Ethereum, but you probably should have an understanding of it to use this guide to the fullest. In addition, I do expect you to know Javascript.Why make a Decentralized Voting app?Essentially, a great decentralized application utilizing blockchain technology allows you perform the same actions you would today (like transferring money) without a trusted third party. The best dApps have a specific real world use-case that leverages the unique characteristics of blockchain.In essence, the blockchain is a shared, programmable, cryptographically secure and therefore trusted ledger which no single user controls and which can be inspected by anyone.- Klaus SchwabEven though a voting app might not be a great app for consumers, I\u2019ve chosen to use it for this guide because the main issues blockchain solves \u2014 transparency, security, accessibility, audibility \u2014 are the main problems plaguing current democratic elections.Since a blockchain is a permanent record of transactions (votes) that are distributed, every vote can irrefutably be traced back to exactly when and where it happened without revealing the voter\u2019s identity. In addition, past votes cannot be changed, while the present can\u2019t be hacked, because every transaction is verified by every single node in the network. And any outside or inside attacker must have control of 51% of the nodes to alter the record.Even if the attacker was able to achieve that while incorrectly entering user votes with their real IDs under the radar, end to end voting systems could allow voters to verify whether their vote was correctly entered in the system, making the system extremely safe.Core Components of EthereumI do expect you to have an understanding of Blockchain and Ethereum for the remainder of this guide. Here is an awesome guide about it, and I\u2019ve written a brief overview of the core components I\u2019d like you to know.Smart Contracts act as the back-end logic and storage. A contract is written in Solidity, a smart contract language, and is a collection of code and data that resides at a specific address on the Ethereum blockchain. It\u2019s very similar to a class in Object Oriented Programming, where it includes functions and state variables. Smart Contracts, along with the Blockchain, are the basis of all Decentralized Applications. They are, like Blockchain, immutable and distributed, which means upgrading them will be a pain if they are already on the Ethereum Network. Fortunately, here are some ways to do that.The Ethereum Virtual Machine(EVM) handles the internal state and computation of the entire Ethereum Network. Think of the EVM as this massive decentralized computer that contains \u201caddresses\u201d that are capable of executing code, changing data, and interacting with each other.Web3.js is a Javascript API that allows you to interact with the Blockchain, including making transactions and calls to smart contracts. This API abstracts the communication with Ethereum Clients, allowing developers to focus on the content of their application. You must have a web3 instance imbedded in your browser to do so.Other Tools we will useTruffle is a popular testing development framework for Ethereum. It includes a development blockchain, compilation and migration scripts to deploy your contract to the Blockchain, contract testing, and so on. It makes development easier!Truffle Contracts is an abstraction on top of the Web3 Javascript API, allowing you to easily connect and interact with your Smart Contract.Metamask brings Ethereum to your browser. It is a browser extension that provides a secure web3 instance linked to your Ethereum address, allowing you to use Decentralized Applications. We will not be using Metamask in this tutorial, but it is a way for people to interact with your DApp in production. Instead, we will inject our own web3 instance during development. For more information, check out this link.Let\u2019s Start!For simplicity, we actually won\u2019t be building the full voting system I described earlier. For ease of explanation, it will just be a one page application where a user can enter their ID and vote for a candidate. There will also be a button that counts and displays the number of votes per candidate.This way, we will be able to focus the process of creating and interacting with the smart contracts within an application. The source code for this entire application will be in this repository, and you will need to have Node.js and npm installed.First, let\u2019s install Truffle globally.npm install -g truffleTo use Truffle commands, you must run them in an existing project.git clone https://github.com/tko22/truffle-webpack-boilerplatecd truffle-webpack-boilerplatenpm installThis repository is just a skeleton of a Truffle Box, which are boilerplates or example applications that you can get in one command \u2014 truffle unbox [box name]. However, the Truffle box with webpack isn\u2019t updated with the latest versions and includes an example application. Thus, I created this repo (the one linked in the instructions above).2. Directory StructureYour directory structure should include these:contracts/ \u2014 Folder holding all of the Contracts. DO NOT DELETE Migrations.solmigrations/ \u2014 Folder holding Migration files, which help you deploy your smart contracts into the Blockchain.src/ \u2014 holds the HTML/CSS and Javascript files for the applicationtruffle.js \u2014 Truffle Configuration filebuild/ \u2014 You won\u2019t see this folder until you compile your contracts. This folder holds the build artifacts so don\u2019t modify any of these files! Build artifacts describe the function and architecture of your contract and give Truffle Contracts and web3 information on how to interact with your Smart Contract in the Blockchain.1. Write your Smart ContractsEnough with the setup and introduction. Let\u2019s get into the code! First off, we\u2019ll be writing our Smart Contract, which is written in Solidity (the other languages aren\u2019t as popular). It may seem scary, but it\u2019s not.For any application, you want your smart contracts to be as simple as possible, even stupidly simple. Remember that you have to pay for every computation/transaction you make, and your smart contracts will be on the Blockchain forever. So, you really want it to work perfectly\u2013\u2013meaning, the more complex it is, the easier it is to make a mistake.Our contract will include:State Variables \u2014 variables that hold values that are permanently stored on the Blockchain. We will use state variables to hold a list and number of Voters and Candidates.Functions \u2014 Functions are the executables of smart contracts. They are what we will call to interact with the Blockchain, and they have different levels of visibility, internally and externally. Keep in mind that whenever you want to change the value/state of a variable, a transaction must occur \u2014 costing Ether. You can also make calls to the Blockchain, which won\u2019t cost any Ether because the changes you made will be destroyed (more on this in Section 3 when we actually make the transactions and calls).Events \u2014 Whenever an event is called, the value passed into the event will be logged in the transaction\u2019s log. This allows Javascript callback functions or resolved promises to view the certain value you wanted to pass back after a transaction. This is because every time you make a transaction, a transaction log will be returned. We will use an event to log the ID of the newly created Candidate, which we\u2019ll display (check the first bullet point of Section 3).Struct Types \u2014 This is very similar to a C struct. Structs allow you to hold multiple variables, and are awesome for things with multiple attributes. Candidates will only have their name and party, but you can definitely add more attributes to them.Mappings \u2014 Think of these like hash-maps or dictionaries, where it has a key-value pair. We will use two mappings.There are a couple more types that aren\u2019t listed here, but some of them are a little more complicated. These five encompass many of the structures a smart contract will generally use. These types are explained more in depth here.For reference, here\u2019s the Smart Contract\u2019s code. Note that this file should be called Voting.sol but I wanted the Github gist to have styling so I gave it a .js extension. Like the rest of this guide, I will provide comments within the code that will explain what it is doing, and I\u2019ll explain the big picture afterwards while pointing out certain caveats and logic.Basically, we have two Structs (types that hold multiple variables) that describe a Voter and a Candidate. With Structs, we are able to assign multiple properties to them, such as emails, address, and so on.To keep track of Voters and Candidates, we put them into separate mappings where they are integer indexed. A Candidate or Voter\u2019s index/key\u2013\u2013lets call it ID \u2014 is the sole way for functions to access them.We also keep track of the number of Voters and Candidates, which will help us index them. In addition, don\u2019t forget about the event in line 8, which will log the candidate\u2019s ID when it\u2019s added. This event will be used by our interface, since we need to keep track of a candidate\u2019s ID in order to vote for a candidate.I know, contrary to what I said earlier about making contracts super simple, I made this contract a little more complicated in comparison to what this application actually does. However, I did this so that it would be a lot easier for you guys to make edits and add features to this application afterward (more on that at the end). If you\u2019d like to make an even simpler voting application, the smart contract could work in less than 15 lines of code.Note that the state variables numCandidates and numVoters are not declared public. By default, these variables have a visibility of internal, which means that they can only be directly accessed by the current contract or derived contracts (don\u2019t worry about that, we won\u2019t be using it).We are using 32bytes for strings instead of using the string type. Our EVM has a word-size of 32 bytes, so it is \u201coptimized\u201d for dealing with data in chunks of 32 bytes. (Compilers, such as Solidity, have to do more work and generate more bytecode when data isn\u2019t in chunks of 32 bytes, which effectively leads to higher gas cost.)When a user votes, a new Voter struct is created and added to the mapping. In order to count the number of votes a certain candidate has, you must loop through all the Voters and count the number of votes. Candidates operate on the same behavior. Thus, these mappings will hold the history of all Candidates and Voters.2. Instantiate web3 and contractsWith our Smart Contract completed, we now need to run our test blockchain and deploy this contract onto the Blockchain. We\u2019ll also need a way to talk to it, which will be via web3.js.Before we start our test blockchain, we must create a file called 2_deploy_contracts.js inside the folder /contracts that tells it to include your Voting Smart Contract when you migrate.To start the development Ethereum blockchain, go to your command line and run:truffle developThis will live on your command line. Since Solidity is a compiled language, we must compile it to bytecode first for the EVM to execute.compileYou should see a build/ folder inside your directory now. This folder holds the build artifacts, which are critical to the inner workings of Truffle, so don\u2019t touch them!Next, we must migrate the contract. Migrations is a Truffle script that helps you alter the state of your application\u2019s contract as you develop. Remember that your contract is deployed to a certain address on the Blockchain, so whenever you make changes, your contract will be located at a different address. Migrations help you do this and also help you move data around.migrateCongratulations! Your smart contract is now on the Blockchain forever. Well, not really\u2026. because truffle develop refreshes every time you stop it.If you\u2019d like to have a persisting blockchain, consider Ganache, which is also developed by Truffle. If you are using Ganache, you will not need to call truffle develop. Instead, you will run truffle compile and truffle migrate. To understand what it really takes to deploy a contract without Truffle, check out this blog post.Once we have deployed the smart contract to the Blockchain, we will have to setup a web3.0 instance with Javascript on the browser whenever the application starts. Thus, the next piece of code will be placed in the bottom of js/app.js. Note that we are using web3.0 version 0.20.1.You don\u2019t really have to worry too much if you don\u2019t understand this code. Just know that this will be run when the application starts and will check if there already is a web3 instance (Metamask) in your browser. If there isn\u2019t, we\u2019ll just create one that talks to localhost:9545, which is the Truffle development blockchain.If you\u2019re using Ganache, you must change the port to 7545. Once an instance is created, we will call the start function (I\u2019ll define it in the next section).3. Add functionalityThe last thing we\u2019ll need to do is to write the interface for the application. This involves the essentials for any web application\u2013\u2013HTML, CSS, and Javascript (We\u2019ve already written a little of the Javascript with creating a web3 instance). First, let\u2019s create our HTML file.This is a very simple page, with an input form for user ID, and buttons for Voting and Counting votes. When those buttons are clicked, they will call specific functions that vote, and will find the number of votes for the candidates.There are three important div elements though, with ids: candidate-box, msg, and vote-box, which will hold checkboxes for each candidate, a message, and the number of votes, respectively. We also import JQuery, Bootstrap, and app.js.Now, we just need to interact with the Contract and implement the functions for voting and counting the number of votes for each candidate. JQuery will manipulate the DOM, and we\u2019ll be using Promises as we make transactions or calls to the Blockchain. Below is the code for app.js.Note that the code I provided in the previous step for creating a web3 instance is also here. First, we import the necessary libraries and webpack stuff, including web3 and Truffle Contracts. We will be using Truffle Contracts, which is built on top of web3 to interact with the Blockchain.To use it, we\u2019ll grab the build artifacts that were automatically built when we compiled the voting smart contract and use them to create the Truffle Contract. Finally, we set up the functions in the global variable window for starting the app, voting for a candidate, and finding the number of votes.To actually interact with the Blockchain, we must create an instance of the Truffle Contract by using the deployed function. This, in turn, will return a promise with the instance as the return value that you will use to call functions from the smart contract.There are two ways to interact with those functions: transactions and calls. A transaction is a write-operation, and it will be broadcast to the entire network and processed by miners (and thus, costs Ether). You must perform a transaction if you\u2019re changing a state variable, since it will change the state of the blockchain.A call is a read-operation, simulating a transaction but discarding the change in state. Thus, it will not cost Ether. This is great for calling getter functions (check out the four getter functions we wrote previously in our smart contract).To make a transaction with Truffle Contracts, you write instance.functionName(param1, param2), with instance as the instance that was returned by the deployed function (Check line 36 for an example). This transaction will return a promise with the transaction data as the return value. Thus, if you return a value in your smart contract function but you perform a transaction with that same function, it will not return that value.This is why we have an event that will log whatever you want it to write into the transaction data that will be returned. In the case of lines 36\u201337, we make a transaction to add a Candidate. When we resolve the promise, we have the transaction data in result.To get the candidateID that we logged with the event AddedCandidate() (check the smart contract to see it 0), we must go through the logs and retrieve it like this: result.logs[0].args.candidateID.To really see what\u2019s going on, use the Chrome developer tools to print out the result and look through its structure of result.To make a call, you will write instance.functionName.call(param1,param2). However, if a function has the keyword view, then Truffle Contracts will automatically create a call and thus you don\u2019t need to add the .call.This is why our getter functions have the view keyword. Unlike making a transaction, the returned promise of a call will have a return value of whatever is returned by the smart contract function.I will now explain the 3 functions briefly but this should be very familiar if you\u2019ve built applications retrieving/changing data from a data store and manipulating the DOM accordingly. Think of the Blockchain as your database, and the Truffle Contracts as the API to get data from your database.App.start()This function is called immediately after we create a web3 instance. To get Truffle Contracts to work, we must set the provider to the created web3 instance and set defaults (like which account you\u2019re using and the amount of gas you want to pay to make a transaction).Since we are in development mode, we can use any amount of gas and any account. During production, we would take the account provided by MetaMask and try to figure out the smallest amount of gas you could use, since it\u2019s actually real money.With everything set up, we will now display the checkboxes for each candidate for the user to vote. To do this, we must create an instance of the contract and get the Candidate\u2019s information. If there aren\u2019t any candidates, we will create them. In order for a user to vote for a candidate, we must provide the ID of that certain candidate. Thus, we make each checkbox element have an id(HTML element attribute) of the ID of the candidate. Additionally, we will add the number Of candidates to a global variable numOfCandidates, which we will use in App.findNumOfVotes(). JQuery is used to append each checkbox and its candidate name to .candidate-box.App.vote()This function will vote for a certain candidate based on which checkbox is clicked and its id attribute.One, we will check whether the user has input their userID, which is their identification. If they didn\u2019t, we display a message telling them to do so.Two, we will check whether the user is voting for a candidate, checking if there is at least one checkbox that\u2019s clicked. If none of the checkboxes were clicked, we will also display a message telling them to vote for a candidate. If one of the checkboxes is clicked, we will grab the id attribute of that checkbox, which is also the linked candidate\u2019s ID, and use that to vote for the candidate.Once the transaction has been completed, we will resolve the returned promise and display a \u201cVoted\u201d message.App.findNumOfVotes()This last function will find the number of Votes for each candidate and display them. We will go through the candidates and call two smart contract functions, getCandidate and totalVotes. We will resolve those promises and create an HTML element for that certain candidate.Now, start the application and you\u2019ll see it on http://localhost:8080/!npm run devResourcesI know, it\u2019s a lot\u2026 You might have this article open for a while as you slowly develop this application and really understand what\u2019s going on. But that\u2019s learning! Please supplement this guide with all the documentation from Ethereum, Truffle, and what I have provided below. I\u2019ve tried to hit many of the key points in this article, but it\u2019s just a brief overview and these resources will help a lot.Everything about Solidity and Smart Contracts \u2014 I mean EverythingEverything about TruffleTruffle Contracts DocsWeb3 Javascript API \u2014 this will be great to know and reference, but Truffle Contracts abstracts many parts of thisUseful DApp patternsEthereum Docs \u2014 look to the side bar and there\u2019s plenty of stuffCryptoKitties Code Explanation \u2014 The writer goes through the important parts of CryptoKitties\u2019 Smart ContractSmart Contract Best Practices \u2014 a must readConclusionBuilding applications on Ethereum is pretty similar to a regular application calling a backend service. The hardest part is writing a robust and complete smart contract. I hope this guide helped you understand the core knowledge of decentralized applications and Ethereum and will help you kick-start your interest in developing them.If you\u2019d like to build off of what we\u2019ve built, here are some ideas. I\u2019ve actually written the smart contract in such a way that it\u2019s easily implemented with everything I\u2019ve given you in this guide.Display the party of each Candidate. We already get the party of a candidate when we run getCandidate(id).Check if the User-entered ID is unique.Ask and store more information about a User, such as their date of birth and home address.Add in an option to see whether a person with a specific id has voted or not. You would create a new form to enter in an ID, which you would then search for that certain user in the blockchain.Write a new smart contract function that counts the votes for BOTH candidates at once. Currently, we have to make two separate calls for two candidates, requiring the contract to loop through all the Users twice.Allow new Candidates to be added. This means adding a new form to add Candidates, but also changing up a little on how we display and vote for candidates in the frontend.Require Users to have an Ethereum Address to vote. My logic for not including user addresses is because voters wouldn\u2019t be expected to have Ethereum to participate in this voting process. However, many DApps will require users to have an Ethereum Address.Also, here are some tips that could prevent some roadblocks from happening:Double and triple check your smart contract functions when something weird is happening. I spent a couple hours on a bug to figure out that I returned the wrong value in one of my functions.Check whether your URL and port are correct when you connect to your development blockchain. Remember: 7545 is for truffle develop and 9545 is for Ganache. These are defaults, so if you can\u2019t connect to your blockchain, you might\u2019ve changed them.I didn\u2019t go over this because this guide would\u2019ve been too long and I probably will make another post on this \u2014 but you should test your contracts! It will help a lot.If you aren\u2019t familiar with promises, go through how they work and how to use them. Truffle Contracts uses promises and the beta for web3 will also support promises. They can, if you do them wrong, mess up a lot of the data you\u2019re retrieving.Cheers to working towards a decentralized and secure internet \u2014 Web 3.0!I hope you enjoyed reading this guide as much as I enjoyed writing it!

Put web3 away for a while as it abstracts things and we\u2019d like to get as bare as it gets.Smart contracts generate logs by firing events. Here\u2019s a transaction receipt that contains one log entry.The log entry consists of one topic and a data field. The first topic refers to the specific event, but we don\u2019t know which one yet. To decode the data we need to obtain ABI of the contract found in the address field.We are interested in items with the type event. Here\u2019s a sample event.{  \"anonymous\": false,  \"inputs\": [    {      \"indexed\": false,      \"name\": \"from\",      \"type\": \"address\"    },    {      \"indexed\": false,      \"name\": \"to\",      \"type\": \"address\"    },    {      \"indexed\": false,      \"name\": \"tokenId\",      \"type\": \"uint256\"    }  ],  \"name\": \"Transfer\",  \"type\": \"event\"}To find out which event the topic refers to we need to compute a signature of each event and find the matching one. Signature is a keccak hash of event name and input argument types, argument names are ignored. For event Hello(uint256 worldId) the signature will be keccak('Hello(uint256)').> keccak('Pregnant(address,uint256,uint256,uint256)')241ea03ca20251805084d27d4440371c34a0b85ff108f6bb5611248f73818b80> keccak('Transfer(address,address,uint256)')ddf252ad1be2c89b69c2b068fc378daa952ba7f163c4a11628f55a4df523b3ef> keccak('Approval(address,address,uint256)')8c5be1e5ebec7d5bd14f71427d1e84f3dd0314c0f7b2291e5b200ac8c7c3b925> keccak('Birth(address,uint256,uint256,uint256,uint256)')0a5311bd2a6608f08a180df2ee7c5946819a649b204b554bb8e39825b2c50ad5> keccak('ContractUpgrade(address)')450db8da6efbe9c22f2347f7c2021231df1fc58d3ae9a2fa75d39fa446199305As we can see, the signature of Transfer event matches the first topic. Now we can decode the data.> types = [i['type'] for i in e['inputs']]['address', 'address', 'uint256']> names = [i['name'] for i in e['inputs']]['from', 'to', 'tokenId']> values = eth_abi.decode_abi(types, log['data'])('0x0035fc5208ef989c28d47e552e92b0c507d2b318', '0x646985c36ad7bf4f3a91283f3ea6eda2af79fac6', 107696)> dict(zip(names, values)){'from': '0x0035fc5208ef989c28d47e552e92b0c507d2b318', 'to': '0x646985c36ad7bf4f3a91283f3ea6eda2af79fac6', 'tokenId': 107696}We can finally read the log. The message says:\u201cTransfer from 0x0035\u2026 to 0x6469\u2026 of token 107696\u201d.Indexed fieldsEach indexed field generates a new topic which is excluded from the data. This allows for efficient search but makes parsing a bit more complicated.Let\u2019s look at another receipt:This one has three topic fields and a small data field. We can already tell that the first topic is Transfer(address,address,uint256) despite the different argument names in this contract.{  \"anonymous\": false,  \"inputs\": [    {      \"indexed\": true,      \"name\": \"from\",      \"type\": \"address\"    },    {      \"indexed\": true,      \"name\": \"to\",      \"type\": \"address\"    },    {      \"indexed\": false,      \"name\": \"value\",      \"type\": \"uint256\"    }  ],  \"name\": \"Transfer\",  \"type\": \"event\"}The remaining two topics are simply indexed inputs. The only value in data is the remaining uint256.> types = [i['type'] for i in e['inputs'] if not i['indexed']]['uint256']> names = [i['name'] for i in e['inputs'] if not i['indexed']]['value']> values = eth_abi.decode_abi(types, log['data'])(5000000000,)> indexed_types = [i['type'] for i in e['inputs'] if i['indexed']]['address', 'address']> indexed_names = [i['name'] for i in e['inputs'] if i['indexed']]['from', 'to']> indexed_values = [eth_abi.decode_single(t, v) for t, v in zip(indexed_types, log['topics'][1:])]['0x00b46c2526e227482e2ebb8f4c69e4674d262e75', '0x54a2d42a40f51259dedd1978f6c118a0f0eff078']> dict(chain(zip(names, values), zip(indexed_names, indexed_values))){'from': '0x00b46c2526e227482e2ebb8f4c69e4674d262e75', 'to': '0x54a2d42a40f51259dedd1978f6c118a0f0eff078', 'value': 5000000000}Note that Ethereum always uses integers to represent numeric values, so we got the value in the minimal denomination. Move the decimal point left by decimals found in the contract, 3 in this case. The message reads:\u201cTransfer from 0x00b4\u2026 to 0x54a2\u2026 of 5,000,000 tokens\u201d.QueryingNow you are ready to do some search. You can query the blockchain using json-rpc api which is provided by full nodes like geth or Parity or a service like Infura. Bloom filters allow you to scan the entire blockchain in seconds and find logs matching the specific topic.You can also specify search range with fromBlock and toBlock, limit the search to specific contract address and omit some of the topics with null which works like a wildcard. The full specification can be found here.Of course, everything described here is already implemented in web3 which allows you to conveniently query the events by name and decodes logs data automatically, but if you care about performance like I do, this approach could save you a lot of time.If you learned something new, clap and subscribe to crypto eli5.", "responses": 7, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Logs", "Blockchain", "Python", "Technical"]}, {"title": "Getting started with INFURA", "post_link": "https://blog.infura.io/getting-started-with-infura-28e41844cc89?source=search_post", "author_name": "Michael Wuehler", "author_link": "https://blog.infura.io/@wuehler", "publish_date": "2016-09-05", "last_modified_date": "2018-07-17", "readtime": "6.87", "claps": 925, "voters": 205, "content": "Getting started with INFURASimple Tutorial using INFURA and the JavaScript Web3 APIMichael WuehlerFollowSep 5, 2016 \u00b7 7 min readUPDATE July 17, 2018: This blog post is no longer up-to-date with the current Infura on-boarding process.Happy Labor Day to our U.S. based friends! In that spirit, why not let INFURA take the work load off of your shoulders when it comes to your Ethereum Dapp development? Let\u2019s take a quick look at how to get started today.Step One: RegisterINFURA is free to use, but you do need to identify your requests sent to our RPC provider endpoints. For that, you need an Access Token. Getting an Access Token is quick and easy. Just visit the INFURA Registration page to quickly register to use our service.INFURA Registration FormYou will notice that the only required field for you to provide is an email address. We will use your email only to provide critical communication regarding service changes in the future that may impact your usage of the service. You can also opt to join our mailing list for ongoing communications and updates of a less critical nature.The rest of the form is optional, however we would really like to hear about how you plan to use our service so we can tailor it to meet your needs as we map out the roadmap. I encourage you to share as much information about your project as you are comfortable with.After submitting your registration, you will be given information on how to access INFURA. It will look something like this:INFURA Welcome NoteThe blurred out part will be your unique Access Token. You\u2019ll also notice that for now, IPFS has no identification mechanism on the URL.Notice that our INFURA provider URLs are all over SSL. Make sure you use https:// when you send requests to INFURA rather than http:// requests. Also note, there is no port on the URL. Our listener is on the standard HTTPS port 443. If for any compatibility reason you need to send requests to INFURA on the standard JSON-RPC port 8545, we support that too, just make sure the HTTP protocol you are using is HTTPS.To our curious user, you might quickly recognize that INFURA works just fine without adding the Access Token to the URL. That is only partially true. While INFURA will work without identifying your requests, these requests will be subjected to more restrictive throttling and filtering of available JSON-RPC methods.Now that you have your provider URLs, let\u2019s get started making a few requests.Step Two: Send a few Ethereum requests via HTTPS POSTINFURA behaves just like a local install of Ethereum running RPC. For a complete set of documentation on the JSON-RPC methods available, you can read the official documentation here.Let\u2019s see how to send a few requests via HTTPS POST using curl. If you are using Linux or Mac OS X, open a Terminal. Windows users will need to download and install curl.What client and version is INFURA running?From the Terminal, enter this command. Remember to replace \u2018MEDIUMTUTORIAL\u2019 with your own unique Access Token from Step One.JSON-RPC Example using curl to query INFURA Ethereum client and versionThis is identical to the official documentation for the web3_clientVersion method, just using your unique INFURA provider URL. You\u2019ll notice the data returned tells you that INFURA is running Geth/v1.4.11-stable/linux/go1.6.2. It is on our roadmap to support many more clients in the future.Easy right? Let\u2019s try one more.What is the latest Ethereum Block that INFURA has seen?For this, we can call the eth_blockNumber method. From the Terminal, enter this command. Again, replace \u2018MEDIUMTUTORIAL\u2019 with your own unique Access Token.JSON-RPC Example using curl to query INFURA Ethereum latest block numberThe result from eth_blockNumber is \u201c0x21a134\u201d. What is that?!? Recall that data passed to and from the HTTP JSON-RPC provider is hexadecimal encoded. Use a converter to convert that to decimal and we see that 0x21a134 in decimal is 2,203,956. That looks more like a block number we would expect!Using curl, we can easily query and post data to the Ethereum blockchain using interactive commands. What if we want to integrate this into a web application?UPDATE: since the publication of this article, the backend has gotten a little more strict in the valid requests it will accept. Therefore, you will need to supply the Content-Type for the POST request as application/json. See below for an up-to-date working example:curl -X POST --data '{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"method\":\"web3_clientVersion\",\"params\":[],\"id\":67}' -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" https://mainnet.infura.ioStep Three: Interact with Ethereum using the Web3 Javascript APIThe Web3 Javascript API is a very useful library that gives you an API to the Ethereum blockchain from within Javascript allowing you to build feature-rich web applications that are able to interact with Ethereum.To demonstrate how quickly you can build a web application, let\u2019s build an Ethereum Account Explorer. Our explorer will do two things, it will print out the block number of the latest block and it will show the balance in Ether for a supplied Ethereum account. Let\u2019s start with a simple HTML for our explorer.HTML Template for Ethereum Account Explorer built on INFURAThe HTML is quite simple. An input field to submit an account that we want to check the balance on, and a few placeholders for where we will print the latest block and the balance of the submitted account. The corresponding HTML follows.Now let\u2019s start adding in the Javascript. First, we need to include the Web3 javascript library. This gives us access to the Web3 API as documented here.Next, we will create a new object called web3 that is an instantiation of Web3. As we do this, we establish our HTTP Web3 provider, that acts as the backend for all of our method calls against that object. This is where INFURA comes in! For the purposes of this tutorial, I am leaving out important error handling logic. For your application, I strongly recommend you review the code shown in the documentation for adding a web3 provider.So far, nothing visible on our page has changed. Now that we have included the Web3 API and instantiated a web3 object. We can begin to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. First, let\u2019s add the latest block number to our page using web3.eth.blockNumber.Let\u2019s take a look at what a visitor to our page sees now.OK, that was pretty easy, right? Now for the last piece, let\u2019s allow the customer to enter an account in the form. To do this, we will create a function called printAccountBalance().There is a lot going on there, so let\u2019s walk through it. The first 10 lines of the function are there so that we can get the value submitted in the form in the account Javascript variable. You don\u2019t need to worry too much about that if you are unfamiliar with Javascript. From there, now that we have the submitted account available in our function, we can use a few web3 methods.First, we call web3.eth.getBalance(account).toNumber(). Per the documentation, we pass an Ethereum Address (account) and it returns a string representing the value in wei, which is the smallest denomination of Ether. We have that value stored in the variable balanceWei, however it is a string. We need to convert that to Ether so will need that value as a number\u2026so we use the method .toNumber() to make that conversion.The web3.fromWei(number, unit) method is a quick and useful way to convert a value in Wei to any other denomination of Ether. We want to know what the value is of balanceWei in Ether, so we use: web3.fromWei(balanceWei, \u2018ether\u2019). We now have a variable called balance that has the account balance in Ether of the provided account. The last two lines of the function print those values out to the web page.The last step is to add the code to call our newly created printAccountBalance() function. With that, let\u2019s take a look at the entire block of code we have put together thus far.Now that all of our code is in place, let\u2019s give it a try. Let\u2019s use our newly built Account Explorer to check the balance of the Ethereum Account that belongs to EthDev: 0xde0B295669a9FD93d5F28D9Ec85E40f4cb697BAe.Wow! That\u2019s a lot of Ether. Let\u2019s confirm that amount at Etherscan.By now you see how powerful the Web3 Javascript API can be. Maybe y0u will be inspired to build your very own Ethereum Block Explorer, or perhaps something else we haven\u2019t seen yet!To see this demo in action and to view the source for your own use, visit http://ethereum.nyc/web3/index.htmlMichael Wuehler (@wuehler) | TwitterThe latest Tweets from Michael Wuehler (@wuehler).

For information on the latest, greatest, see Scaling Web3 with SignTypedData!Developer note: This article discusses a new method available to websites viewed with MetaMask and Mist browsers, called personal_sign. This is replacing eth_sign, and that old method now has a big red warning for your users because it was deprecated for security reasons. It\u2019s left in place only to keep sites running that rely on it.When people get excited about MetaMask, it\u2019s usually because it allows users to interact with the Ethereum blockchain, which usually involves owning some network fuel called Ether, to run programs on a global shared virtual computer, and we think this is great.However, even without any Ether, MetaMask makes some new things possible for websites, because to interact with the Ethereum blockchain, MetaMask had to add private key management to the browser.When the modern browser was first created, it was seen as a linked document browser, and so identity and payments weren\u2019t baked in. This led to the world of password management that we have today, where each website holds a database that includes your account, and maybe credit card, and when you connect with them, you prove who you are with a password.MetaMask lets us reverse this relationship, and explore a web where the browser can secure your identity for you, in the form of a cryptographic key pair.Called a signature because like a pen signature, it can be used to identify who wrote it.One of the basic functions of a cryptographic key pair is signing data. When you sign some data, anyone can see that your signature could only be produced by the person who holds your private key. This is powerful, because it means you can compose a message and prove that you authored it (or at least had it at some point).One example use of this that normal sites could use today, would be for signing a terms of service agreement. The site could submit their terms of service using eth.personal_sign(fromAddress, hexEncodedUtf8Message), and the user will get a MetaMask message like this:MetaMask can now render plain text for signing, so sites can make their signature challenges human readable. We\u2019d like to offer more rich rendering options in the future, and this is discussed in EIP 185.Once the user signs it, the site could store that signature, and later on they could use it to prove that the user signed the message.This means a user doesn\u2019t need to hold any ether to perform a meaningful act with their MetaMask accounts. In the past, when a website would check the current accounts via web3.eth.accounts, the site only really knew that the user intended to appear as that account, but with a simple signature challenge, you can prove they really do control that account. From there, you could give them a browser cookie to stay logged in. That\u2019s account management without any external, third-party services like Facebook Connect or Google tracking your every move.We\u2019re excited to see what\u2019s possible in a web with accounts baked into the browser, and hope that someday account management like this is baked into every operating system, to enable a seamless, personal, distributed web.For DevelopersI\u2019ve created a sample repository for showing how to submit a message & verify it using MetaMask\u2019s injected APIs, mostly using our own utility lib eth-sig-utils. These methods are not yet supported by web3.js (pending this pull request), but that repo has examples for either using the raw provider object directly, or using a new web3 alternative, EthJS.Security NoticeThese methods, personal_sign and its partner, personal_ecRecover have replaced the previous signature methods, eth_sign and eth_recover. That\u2019s because the previous methods signed raw data unmodified, making it vulnerable to chosen ciphertext attacks, as well as potentially signing transactions you didn\u2019t intend to. You can read more about the reasoning behind this change on the go-ethereum repository.Compatibility NoticeWhile go-ethereum was first to implement these methods, Parity has also since released the feature, although it is not presently compatible with the Geth version. Since we had to choose one, we went with the original implementation, so our sign & recovery methods are currently bit-compatible with Geth, but not Parity.We\u2019re as frustrated as you about the lack of unified standards in the application layer of Ethereum, which is why we\u2019re also working towards building an EIP Standards Signaling DAO.

The term blockchain has become a popular topic. Everyone is talking about blockchain and its usages in decentralized applications. But most of the time the underline concept of a blockchain is misinterpreted. Let us try to understand it in simple terms. Blockchain can be considered as a database technology which is used to store data in a distributed manner. It uses hashing algorithms to maintain the integrity of data which is very much similar to Git. Every node in block chain will have its own copy of the data store. The manipulation of records in the data store is prevented by a proof of work algorithm.Processing nodes are connected peer-to-peer and will work autonomously. This enable the elimination of third party player such as banking system the middle of a transaction to manage the risk. Cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin is an example usage of blockchain technology. But it is not limited to Cryptocurrency.BlockchainThe purpose of the blockchain technology is to eliminate the need of having a middle man to facilitate financial transactions. In a typical payment system a bank or a financial institution will minimize the risk of the transaction by acting as a middle man.Typical transaction flowBlockchain technology facilitates payments without a middle player. For example you can transfer digital money from your account to your supplier account without the help of paypal or any other third party payment provider functionalities. So blockchain is simple as that.Direct peer-to-peer transactionDefinition : A blockchain is a peer-to-peer distributed ledger forged by consensus, combined with a system for \u201csmart contracts\u201d and other assistive technologies. Rememner blockchain is not a single technology. It is a collection of technologies.Blockchain TechnologyLets try to understand these technologies.DLT : Distributed ledgers use independent computers (referred to as nodes) to record, share and synchronize transactions in their respective electronic ledgers (instead of keeping data centralized as in a traditional ledger). Blockchain organizes data into blocks, which are chained together in an append only mode.Blockchain is a specific form or subset of distributed ledger technologies. It is the way that the data is stored in the DLT. But the term Blockchain has become the buzz word for the entire technology stack.Peer-to-peer : Nodes in a blockchain are connected peer-to-peer. You can connect a local node running in your laptop to the blockchain network seamlessly.Decentralized : In a decentralized system each node is running autonomously. The main difference with a distributed system is that in a distributed system there are dedicates set of nodes to control other nodes. But in a decentralized system no one takes commands from each other. No concept of client server of master slave. Every one has equal decision power.DecentralizedCryptographically secure: Blockchain uses digital signature (SHA256) algorithm to maintain/verify integrity of the data.Digital SignatureAnonymous: In blockchain an account with a key pair ( public key & private key) is used a wallet for submitting transactions. There is no way of identifying a user or any other personal information by looking at a transaction. It is completely anonymous. For example if you go to etherscan.io which is the central application to view Ethereum blockchain transactions then the from account and to account would be something like below.AnonymousWe will talk about these technologies in more details later. Lets have a look at the history of blockchain.My other publications :Java \u201cHello world\u201d Microservice with Vert.X, Docker and KubernetesOracle JDK is no longer free !!Java Code Convention SimplifiedCreate your own Cryptocurrency in Ethereum BlockchainEthereum Blockchain \u201cHello World\u201d Smart Contract with JAVAGit in Real Life \u2014 GitFlow Branching modelContinuous Integration (CI) toolchain for JAVAJava Web Services with RESTEasy, JSON, TestNG, Mockito & MavenHistory : Blockchain technology has found a solution for the Byzantine generals problem as illustrated in below article.Byzantine generals problemBlockchain: The Byzantine Generals ProblemThere is a problem in computing which until very recently, had no solution.

In an open and public blockchain such as BitCoin or Ethereum anyone can join as a node to the main network. But in an enterprise blockchain such as Hyperledger fabric only authorized nodes can enter into the network.Types of blockchainsThere are many implementations of blockchain technology. We will be discussing about Ethereum.Blockchain ImplementationsBitCoin : October 31st of 2008, a white paper has been submitted by an unknown person called Satoshi Nakamoto on performing electronic transactions without the need of a middle party. This is the origin of BitCoin. The whole purpose of the BitCoin technology was to transfer money between two parties in a peer-to-peer manner in contract to current financial transactions which are performed with the help of an intermediary (like a Bank).BitCoinhttps://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdfEthereum : December 2013 , Vitalik Buterin wrote a white paper on extending the blockchain technology beyond the financial transactions and the idea of Smart Contracts. This is the origin of Ethereum.https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paperhttp://web.archive.org/web/20131228111141/http://vbuterin.com/ethereum.htmlhttps://blockchainreview.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/02.01._final_Ethereum-White-Paper-Made-Simple.pdfVitalik Buterin : Co-founder of EthereumMain components of EthereumEthereum is written using Go programming language. Geth is the command line tool/interface for running a full ethereum node. You have the option of connecting to main ethereum network or create your own private network. If you are connected to main network then entire block chain data (~45GB) will be downloaded to your machine. Therefore we are going to setup our own network with one node.EthereumSmart Contract in ethereum is a piece of code that can be deployed and executed to perform business functions. The compiled code is run on every node using ethereum JVM. Contract has its own account address. The caller should pay ether to deploy and execute smart contracts in nodes. A token (Currency) is also a smart contract. These contracts are written using Solidity language. You can define your own currency as a smart contract.Account in ethereum is a combination of account address, a public key and a private key. Address is used to when performing transactions such as fund transfer. Account address is derived from public key. Private key is used to sign the transactions.There are couple of test ethereum networks available in addition to main ethereum network. Ropsten, Kovan & Rinkeby can be used to test your application before moving into production main network.AccountsWallet is used to create/manage your accounts. Wallet can have multiple accounts.MetaMask is a wallet manager app which can be downloaded as a Chrome extension. You will have to trust them to keep your private key.Remix is an online IDE for solidity language. Remix runs it own ethereum node for testing purposes.web3js is a java script framework which can be used to interact with the ethereum nodeweb3j is a java API which can be used to interact with the nodeMist is a browser to browse dApps hosted in cloud. It can be used as a wallet manage as well.Geth is the command line tool which is used to interact with the blockchainTransaction is the fundamental message structure in blockchain.Ethereum blockchain consists of multiple nodes. Each node will have its own copy of blocks. Nodes are communicated peer-to-peer using a gossip protocol.TransactionTransactionA block contains multiple transactions.BlockNodeBlockchain is a link list of Blocks which are connected with Hash values similar to Git. Changing the content of one block will result in change of Hash values in the chain.BlockchainSet of transactions (Block) will be selected by a node for validations. Each transaction is digitally singed with the private key of the user. The public key is embedded in the transaction so that nodes can use the public key to validate the signatures. Once signatures are validated, the node tries to find the next valid block by solving a hashing puzzle. The puzzle is to find a number called Nonse so that the resulting hash of the block will start from given number of leading zeros. For example in below block Node will iterate Nonse = 0 to n so that when n = 139358, the block Hash contains five leading zeros. This is called mining. Once the correct Nonse is found the Node will send this block for other Nodes for confirmation. After a certain number of confirmations the block is accepted as the next block in the chain. The Node is rewarded with some amount of Ether for finding the Nonse. This is where the computing power matters.MiningA chain of blocks is created by using Hash of the previous block in newly Mined block. The Hash of the previous block is an input for the current block. If the previous block is modified then the Hash of the previous block is changed. This will have a chain reaction in entire block chain. Because changing of previous Hash will impact the next block Hash and the next block Hash and it continues\u2026MiningThis is how blockchain maintains integrity of the data. There is an interactive tutorial on this in https://anders.com/blockchain/tokens.htmlSubmitting a transaction from WalletSubmit TransactionInterfacing with Ethereum : It is possible to interact with ethereum blockchain using web3js java script API.Interfacing with ethereumLets create our own private network with one node.Download & install Geth: Download windows version of Geth from below URL and install it. Geth is the command line interface for the blockchain.https://geth.ethereum.org/downloads/Create genesis block & data folder : You need to create your initial block (genesis block) to start the block chain protocol. Create a new folder in your hard drive and save below content as genesis.json. Change the chainId value from 1 to a different number to avoid connecting to main network. chainId=1 is reserved for the main network.{  \"coinbase\"   : \"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001\",  \"difficulty\" : \"0x20000\",  \"extraData\"  : \"\",  \"gasLimit\"   : \"0x2fefd8\",  \"nonce\"      : \"0x0000000000000042\",  \"mixhash\"    : \"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\",  \"parentHash\" : \"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\",  \"timestamp\"  : \"0x00\",  \"alloc\": {},  \"config\": {        \"chainId\": 10,        \"homesteadBlock\": 0,        \"eip155Block\": 0,        \"eip158Block\": 0    }}Create an empty folder called chaindata to store the blocks. Final state will be as follows.genesis.json & data folderOpen your command prompt from this folder and use below command to initiate blockchain protocol. This will not start any node.geth --datadir=./chaindata/ init ./genesis.jsonInitiate block chainStart your private node : Now you can start your private node using below command.geth --datadir=./chaindata/ --rpc consoleStart private nodeDownload & install wallet manager app : Wallet manager app can be used to create ethereum accounts. An account is a keystore in ethereum with private and public key pair. Keys will be saved in chaindata folder by default. The private key is used to encrypt/sign transactions when submitting to block chain. This key will be loaded by web3j as well. You can use Mist as a wallet manager and to browse ehereum app store. On the other hand wallet manager can be installed as a standalone application as well. https://github.com/ethereum/mist/releases?after=0.4.0We will create two testing accounts using wallet manager app. Download and install wallet manager app from below location.Install wallet manager apphttps://github.com/ethereum/mist/releases2. Launch wallet manager app : Remix wallet manager app will connect to your private node by default. You can see it in below screenshot under \u201cPRIVATE NET\u201d red color label.No need to wait for the sync activity with main network, we are just running our local node. Press the launch application button.Wallet Manager3. Create two accounts : we will do a simple money transfer transaction using wallet manager app. Two different accounts are needed for that. You can create account using wallet manager app. Go to File menu and press new account. Specify your wallet password. This will create your keystore file with private key and public key. Same process can be repeated to create another account for money transfer transaction. The first account will be identified as the main account by default.Create new accountThis is your identity and it should be protected in a safe place. You can locate your kestore files under chaindata/keystore folder.Keystore filesWhat is in your keystore file : https://medium.com/@julien.maffre/what-is-an-ethereum-keystore-file-86c8c5917b97In a real world scenario MetaMask will act as your keystore manager. The MetaMask chrome browser extension will manage your keys and will use the private key stored in your browsers data store to sign the transactions.https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/39954/does-metamask-store-private-key-on-server-or-anywhere-else4. Start Mining : There is not point of having an account without real money (Ether). We can get some free ether to our main account by starting mining process using Geth console. Below is the command.miner.start();You can navigate to wallet manager app to see how ether is added to your account in real time. Ether will be added to your main account.5. Transfer EtherPress the SEND button in wallet manager to transfer ether from one account to another. Select the FROM account. Copy and paste the address of destination account to TO field. Specify the amount. A fee should be paid for the minors to perform this transaction. You can select your fee under SELECT FEE section and press the SEND button. You will be prompt to enter the keystore password of the source account. Once submitted miners ( we have one miner will start the mining process.Transfer EtherPlease make sure that your node has started mining. If not use miner.start(); command in geth console to start it. It is possible to see the status of your last transaction in wallet manager app. 12 confirmations are required to complete the transaction. Once transaction is completed check your account balances to confirm the money transfer effect. Next we will do the same money transfer transaction using web3j library.Lets start coding with web3jweb3j is a lightweight, highly modular, reactive, type safe Java and Android library for working with Smart Contracts and integrating with clients (nodes) on the Ethereum network.web3jCreate an empty maven project and add below dependency.

The actual file name of the keystore file should be mentioned in the code. It will not work if you specify the folder name and not the file name. Use valid destination account address in to parameter. Once above code is executed you can validate the transferred amount in wallet manager app. Miner should be running in your geth console to complete the transaction.Codepackage org.web3j.sample;import org.slf4j.Logger;import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;import org.web3j.crypto.Credentials;import org.web3j.crypto.WalletUtils;import org.web3j.protocol.Web3j;import org.web3j.protocol.core.methods.response.TransactionReceipt;import org.web3j.protocol.http.HttpService;import org.web3j.tx.Transfer;import org.web3j.utils.Convert;import java.math.BigDecimal;public class Application {    private static final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(Application.class);    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {        new Application().run();    }    private void run() throws Exception {        // We start by creating a new web3j instance to connect to remote nodes on the network.

Smart contract will be installed in all nodes in the network. Installation is a one time operation and it has to be submitted as a transaction to the network by spending ether for the miners. Once installed you cannot modify it. It is like a stored procedure in a rational database. You can call functions in the contract by submitting transactions. You can use the Remix browser application to write the smart contract. Remix has an inbuilt ethereum node where you can deploy the contract and test it. Navigate to https://remix.ethereum.org in your browser and write below code.HelloWorld.solpragma solidity ^0.4.16;contract HelloWorld {   uint256 counter = 5;      function add() public {  //increases counter by 1       counter++;   }    function subtract() public { //decreases counter by 1       counter--;   }      function getCounter() public constant returns (uint256) {       return counter;   } }Deploy & test your contract in Remix.Compile your contact using Compile option. Then navigate to Run tab and press Deploy button to deploy it. Your contract will be deployed as a Transaction. Therefore you need to specify the source account address and a Gas limit (amount of ether paid for miners for the execution of this transaction). Once deployed contract will have its own address. This address can be used to call methods in the transaction.Deployed contractYou can execute functions in the contract by pressing add, subtract and getCounter buttons. Press the add button and then press the getCounter button to check the value of your counter.Execute the contractNow we will be deploying the contract using web3j instead of Remix. First we need to compile the contract. The compiled output of the Smart Contract has two parts. The binary file ( which will be executed in ethereum JVM once deployed) and the application binary interface (ABI) which is a human readable definition of the contract represented in JSON format. These output is required to generate the wrapper class uisng web3j. The wrapper class will hide all the complexities of connecting & executing your smart contract. It will act as an interface for the smart contract.Compile ContractCompile the contactWe will be using solc compiler to compile the contract. You can download the windows version of it.https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releasesSolidity: Using solc on Windows \u00b7 Code OozeThe solc command line compiler is a C++ implementation of the Solidity compiler that can output opcodes for\u2026www.codeooze.comsolc compilerDownload and extract the zip file into your hard disk.

The primary building blocks of blockchain technology can be used in enterprise applications such as immutability, anonymity & security. For an example a land registration system can be easily build using Smart Contracts in Ethereum. Any application built using blockchain will leverage one or more capabilities of blockchain.Conclusionweb3j is an effective method of interfacing with Ethereum blockchain using Java language.I just started writing my next article in creating your own Currency (Token) using smart contract.

But it doesn\u2019t have to be that way. Changes are underway that will soon make the decentralized web accessible to everyone.The next generation of decentralised platforms, tokenised ecosystems, dApps and identity management solutions being built will immeasurably benefit all global citizens who rely on the web \u2014 which is pretty much everyone. The value, security and increased sense of identity these innovations will bring cannot be overstated. Such is is the importance of the third, incoming iteration of the web that I believe it should be enshrined as an inalienable fundamental right for all. It may be the geeks and developers who create it, but every web user stands to benefit from it. An innate understanding of its underlying architecture will not be necessary to appreciate that much.Comparison Web2 > Web3Web 3.0: Still Under ConstructionBut first, there\u2019s much work to be done. The first web 3.0 platforms are much like the first mainstream websites that spring up in the 90s: clunky, slow and user-unfriendly. For all the promise that decentralized storage solutions such as Sia and Storj offer, for example, their UX lags behind the likes of Google Drive and Dropbox. IPFS, the peer-to-peer file storage system used by these decentralized alternatives, is the preserve of developers, and not the public, for now. For so long as these decentralized platforms remain unusable on mobile and out of reach of the average web user, they will remain niche tools for those with the aptitude and patience to trade their benefits for their drawbacks.It\u2019s not just decentralized storage solutions that are in their infancy; the same holds true of the entire web 3.0 ecosystem. Just try using a service like Mist, the decentralized Ethereum browser, or P2P exchange EtherDelta without screaming. The interface and accessibility of these platforms and many more leaves a lot to be desired. The revolution is coming, but there are still a few kinks to iron out before it\u2019s ready to be laid before the public at large.It was frustration at the current state of play within the decentralized economy that spurred me on to create Essentia.one. No one, I realised, was going to take to this brave new world if it was uglier than the one they had left behind. As a result, I began brainstorming with my colleagues to devise solutions to this mess, solutions that would make the decentralized web more accessible and safer for all. The answer, when it came to us, was a Damascene moment: we were going to create a unique seed for managing access to dApps, wallets, exchanges and a host of other identities and digital assets. One highly secure seed to rule them all.Turning Ideas Into RealityFor web 3.0 to work, access should be as easy as that of the existing web. Using a dApp should be as simple as logging into Facebook or scrolling through Twitter. Everyone deserves the right to be able to store and secure their data in a decentralized manner without requiring a Computer Science degree to master the basics. While there are some great web 3.0 applications being made, there is still much work to be done. MetaMask is for desktop browsers only; likewise with Ethereum wallet Parity. At present, there is a decentralized web accessibility problem.What Must Be DoneThis is an appeal to the entire crypto industry: web 3.0 is an amazing and untapped opportunity, a once in a lifetime chance to rebuild the web from the ground up, and this time to get it right. It wasn\u2019t the fault of the web\u2019s founding fathers that their creation ultimately became insecure and over-centralized \u2014 we\u2019re eternally grateful to them for everything they did. But times have changed, threats have intensified and the hour has come for a safer and fairer web, one that works for everyone and is owned by everyone instead of a privileged few.If we don\u2019t make web 3.0 as seamless and intuitive to use as the alternatives then the world will stick with the status quo, despite its flaws and holes. We need to make this new paradigm one which works on every device and for every user with UI and UX that is a pleasure and not a chore.The first step towards decentralization began in 2008 with the publication of the Bitcoin white paper. A decade has since passed and it\u2019s now time to accelerate adoption dramatically. It\u2019s time to stop talking and start making. 2018 needs to be the year when we start actually adopting these tools. We need to stop discussing blockchain and decentralization and start using them to better our lives and the lives of everyone around us \u2014 not to mention those of the billions others we will never meet.We\u2019ve come a long way. In 2017 we achieved what had hitherto seen impossible: we got the world talking about the systems we\u2019re building. Now it\u2019s time to get them using them, and not simply trialling them, but adopting them en masse. We need to understand that the typical web users is inherently lazy and inclined to stick with what they know. It\u2019s not their fault; it\u2019s human nature. Thus, the onus is on us to provide these people with super easy and smart solutions, the sort that are as user-friendly as iOS is for web 2.0, but with better privacy and security through decentralization. If we can achieve that, we will enable a wide-scale transition from the centralized web to a decentralized, permissionless, and censorship-resistant one.With the Essentia team we are trying to build a decentralized framework where the average user will be able to access web 3.0 purely from a seed, with no need to submit private identity information such as their phone number, email or name, all of which are targets for hackers on the legacy web we use today. Using a two-click setup, we will furnish them with a multitude of integrated and connected decentralized dApps, services and resources all at their fingertips. By the time we\u2019re done, Essentia.one will be accessible to everyone \u2014 even grandma.To be a part of the change, join the discussion in our Telegram group.Personal Bio, Twitter, FacebookDon\u2019t miss the latest updates about our projects by subscribing to the newsletter.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Web3", "Ethereum", "Essentiaone", "Bitcoin"]}, {"title": "Polkadot Is Coming\u2026", "post_link": "https://medium.com/polkadot-network/polkadot-is-coming-a8b86fde9161?source=search_post", "author_name": "Polkadot", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@polkadotnetwork", "publish_date": "2017-08-23", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-06", "readtime": "2.19", "claps": 437, "voters": 57, "content": "Polkadot Is Coming\u2026PolkadotFollowAug 23, 2017 \u00b7 3 min readWelcome to Polkadot\u2019s Medium, brought to you by the Web3 Foundation. On this blog you will find updates to our project, FAQs, and highlights from both core team members and guest contributors.Introducing: PolkadotWe\u2019ve seen a number of blockchain and crypto projects reach significant milestones. Some are highly functional and open such as Ethereum while others provide strong privacy like Zcash. Others are designed to fulfill the permissioning requirements of enterprise and operate in private.In the future, we see a world filled with diverse blockchains all serving specific and unique purposes. Currently, these blockchain networks exist in isolation with no communication or interoperability between them; this is an existential problem that needs to be addressed in order for a truly trustless ecosystem to develop and thrive.Polkadot is a network that connects blockchains. With Polkadot, various blockchains are able to send and receive messages between each other.This incredibly important development will help bring about the new ecosystem of Web3. A world where decentralized apps (Dapps) may leverage many interconnecting blockchains. Private/consortium and public/permissionless networks and oracles, will deliver new, novel and decentralised services.Wait, But How?Security is pooled within the Polkadot ecosystem, which means that individual chains can leverage collective security without having to start from scratch to gain traction and trust.Polkadot can also ease some of the scalability issues encountered by isolated blockchains. By running transactions in parallel, Polkadot gives the ability to split transactions between multiple parachains (the name given to \u2018parallelised\u2019 chains that participate as part of the Polkadot network).We are creating a blockchain where token holders have complete control over the protocol. All privileges, which on other platforms are exclusive to miners, will be given to the relay chain participants, including managing exceptional events such as protocol upgrades and fixes.This is the groundwork that allows Polkadot token holders to imagine completely new systems free from old models of trust. We aim to create one common network across multiple blockchains. What gets built on top of that is up to you.What will you create with Polkadot?There\u2019s much more to share, and we look forward to doing so in the coming weeks. Stay tuned for details around community resources, our token sale, and important FAQs.In the meantime, we welcome your thoughts and participation in the development of Polkadot.Join us here:Chat with us on Riot: Polkadot WatercoolerCommunity discussion on the subreddit: Polkadot_marketFollow our official updates via TwitterThe Web3 Foundation (W3F) is currently supporting the development of Polkadot.The Web3 Foundation was created to nurture and steward technologies and applications in the fields of decentralized web software protocols, particularly those which utilize modern cryptographic methods to safeguard decentralization, to the benefit and for the stability of the Web3 ecosystem.We will be publishing more information on the W3F in the coming weeks.", "responses": 1, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Polkadot Network", "Ethereum"]}, {"title": "Five reasons why Tezos rocks!", "post_link": "https://medium.com/tokyo-fintech/five-reasons-why-tezos-rocks-322ce8f86419?source=search_post", "author_name": "Norbert Gehrke", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@norbert.gehrke", "publish_date": "2018-10-23", "last_modified_date": "2018-10-26", "readtime": "1.82", "claps": 1385, "voters": 56, "content": "Five reasons why Tezos rocks!Norbert GehrkeFollowOct 23, 2018 \u00b7 2 min readArthur Breitman of TezosThe following are (most of) the slides presented by Arthur Breitman of Tezos at the Web3 Summit in Berlin on Tuesday, October 23.Please see also the following Web3 Summit reports:Ewald Hesse, Energy Web FoundationRobert Habermeier: Implications of InteroperabilityIf you found value in this article, please \u201cclap\u201d (up to 50 times).This article is part of our Tokyo FinTech Publication, please follow us to read more from our writers, like hundreds of readers do every day.

This presentation was an excellent primer on the state of the energy markets today, as well as the case for transformation and disruption, which EWF is well positioned to drive.This is the first time we actually talk to blockchain people about energy, and I would like to give you a picture of the energy market, and how to transform this market, or rather how to help this market transform, which it does by itself already. It is actually a no-brainer, because in energy markets, most of the decisions are based on sensor data. The energy market is filled with sensors everywhere. So if you have a virtual machine, then you can connect it to this data, and you can automate everything through smart contracts. The question is why.The answer to this question is what made us establish the foundation. We created the foundation together with the Rocky Mountain Institute, which has been trying to convince the world for 35 years why running on renewable energy is better than running on fossil fuels. So what we do with the Energy Web Foundation, we are actually building a chain, we are building a product which should constitute the smallest common denominator for the whole energy market around the world. And besides that, which is probably the biggest and most difficult task, we are explaining what kind of new degrees of freedom there are in this technology to our affiliates, 50% of which are large corporations, and 50% startups. Startups get it pretty much, but for large corporations it is very difficult to understand, because there is an abstraction that needs to happen in the business model, and an understanding of the new world, and that is not easy.Transformation in the energy marketSo, the energy market is actually very simple. If you look at electricity, there are basically two things you have: on the one side, it is just \u201cproduce & sell\u201d, and that is also the key performance indicator for most of the utilities out there, produce cheap and sell high. What is difficult is that you can only produce as much as is consumed at the same time. So if you produce more, the wave in between the frequency gets compressed, and if your frequency diverges outside of the tolerance, then you will have a blackout. For example in Europe, we have a 50Hz frequency. If everyone turns off their washing machines right now, the frequency goes down, the wave is stretched, and if it goes below 48Hz, we have a blackout.Now, the frequency is of national interest, and that is the reason we have a regulator there. So the regulator is there to put tools into the market to ensure that the frequency is always stable. And this is making the market very complex, because there is usually one entity in each market that is responsible for balancing the market. For example in Germany that is a transmission system operator (TSO), of which there are four nationwide. These are the companies that operate the high voltage lines, those very big ones going overland, and what these parties do, they buy capacity, very fast capacity in an auction, and they basically switch on and off all the time, as they see the frequency going up or down, they just inject and take energy out again. And of course, the more renewables we have in the energy system, the higher the cost for actually doing this. And the interaction in injecting energy, and taking energy out, has actually been growing exponentially in the last 15 years. Now the question is, imagine me being a TSO, and being responsible for adjusting the frequency, who is actually paying for my cost, and it is actually very expensive to balance the grid.Anyone who wants to trade energy has to register, and they have to send a daily forecast to the transmission system operator, to the balancing authority, as well as any deals they made, here I bought, here I sold, which must balance at the end. And then after two months, they also have to send the actual data from their smart meter points. This is all done on Excel files. In Germany, we have 8,000 of those balancing groups, we have at least 300 traders, they are sending 8,000 Excel files to the transmission system operator. Because the transmission system operator has difficulty managing these 8,000 Excel files per day, and trying to figure out who really deviated from their forecast, there are specific thresholds to participate in this market. There is a minimum product you can trade. The minimum product you can trade in the energy market on a global scale right now is roughly one third of an annual household consumption, so an individual household cannot really participate. It is about 1 MWh or even higher, like 5 MWh. These are very large products, meaning households are not enabled to participate in this market.The energy markets are changingNow imagine you were to allow very small devices to participate in this market. Devices as small as even a laptop. Meaning, if a laptop can participate in the energy market, then it would actually change the nature of electrical appliances, because I could see that this laptop could actually do arbitrage, because there is quite a big spread between the lowest and the highest energy price. So the laptop, or an agent on behalf of the laptop, could buy and sell energy. This will alter any type of appliance. A simple example is an electric vehicle. If you buy an electric vehicle, and the market has established tools that also very small products can be traded, then for an electric vehicle in the future, there will a return on investment. A Tesla Model 3, if you put it on the road in Amsterdam, and it is trading energy for six hours every day, at a cost of EUR 35k for this car, the breakeven point would be reached in roughly 3.5 years. As such, in the future you will buy electric vehicles as an investment, they will earn you money after four years. And the same can happen to washing machines, to fridges, etc. So what is happening is \u2014 and this has nothing to do with blockchain \u2014 that it is becoming more economically efficient to install smaller devices, meaning to produce electricity at the end point, rather than maintaining very large power plants.More and more renewables are entering the energy marketsWhen we started our research into the application of blockchain in the energy sector, which was around the time when Ethereum came onto the market 4.5 years ago, the renewable energy injected into the overall energy market was about 20%. We are now at 25%. When looking at the market development, we can forecast that in the next 20\u201330 years the world will run on 100% renewables. This is great, but it brings another problem: the fewer large generators we have in the network, the less inertia we have, and inertia is stabilizing the frequency. Renewables are very difficult to predict, meaning there will be more and more interactions required to balance the grid. Also, batteries are getting cheaper and cheaper. Compared with 2011, by 2016 the price had nearly halved. My prediction is that in probably 5 to 10 years, manufacturers will use little batteries in their appliances like fridges, washing machines, etc., because, again, you can have a return on investment, as these devices can participate in the energy market.Decentralized energy gridSo, if you look at IT in the energy market, as I said before, 10 or 12 years ago, the whole energy market had basically its own IT infrastructure. All the information was transmitted through proprietary fiberglass installations, they did not even use the internet for communication. And if we are now looking at the market with more and more renewables entering, then we are looking at a completely different market. So, on the other side, you see this tool of a smart contract, and you think \u201cHey guys, you have 8,000 Excel spreadsheets, which is nothing else but sending a data point and then confirming it, if you put all this into a smart contract, then you have compliance upfront.\u201d And then there is no reason anymore to have any thresholds for entering the market, because you are not dealing with those Excel files, it is a smart contract. It is working as it is supposed to work. And this is a very simple thing where you can start taking action, but it is not as easy as it sounds, because the energy market is not quite there yet.Energy Web requirementsFrom all our research at the EWF, there are now over 250 blockchain startups focused on energy, and many of them are our partners and affiliates. So we developed requirements for what the blockchain needs to have, or what the future energy backbone should be able to do. And if you look at all these requirements, it is clear that Ethereum cannot do it yet, a Proof-of-Authority (PoA) chain is already better, but also cannot do it yet.So we have had a chain license for the last year, it is a PoA chain, and we funded the development of that already a long time ago, and one of the first test networks was actually on Ethereum. So we are constantly pushing the next development. And Gavin Wood earlier today showed what will essentially be Energy Web 2.0, where every affiliate, every application developer will have her own chain. As the chain runs right now, we have permissioned validators, and these validators are distributed around the globe, some are our early affiliates, like Tepco in Japan, Singapore Power. We built up the foundation very strategically in terms of validators, so that the network is spread around the globe. All the affiliates can actually chose whether they want to become a validator.The public Energy WebIt is a public network, and that is a very crucial decision we made, that the network is actually public. We are convinced that otherwise innovation will not happen. So we are eating our own dog food. And if it is a closed network that only permissioned parties can access, then there is no token economics inside, and it will be very difficult to determine what the network is actually worth, or how secure it is. We are convinced that if it is a public network, and everyone can mess around with it, then we can also have an indirect measure of security for this.A blockchain paltform for the energy sectorThe majority of the stack that we have out there is being developed by Parity Technologies, and the EWF funded it. And on the use case side, what we actually do is, we have lots of workshops with our affiliates, we try to come up with the smallest common denominator. So a few of our affiliates are using this, and the affiliates are actually helping us to prioritize our funds into tech development. One of the first was of course light client development. Then WASM, Secret Store \u2014 secret smart contracts are not really sufficient for many applications that we have now \u2014 , and block explorer.Energy Web building blocksWhat is actually very interesting is the dilemma on the light nodes and connecting assets. It is one of the most crucial things. So we have developed a couple of light nodes, and we have also worked closely with a couple of smart meter manufacturers. Christoph Jentzsch from slock.it has developed a very light node, and there were a couple of tests how we can actually put this light node into a smart meter, to avoid the necessity that everyone has to build their own data logger. So if you look at the energy startup scene right now, the first thing that everyone has to do, they have to build a data logger to get access to the data. I want to have access to lots of applications, but I do not want to buy 20 data loggers. So the question is, how to overcome this, there is a bit of a dilemma there. If you talk to startups, if you talk to innovators, and you ask them if they are interested in launching their application also on other data loggers, then of course everyone says yes, but if you ask them at the same time, would you be open to opening your data logger to other applications, then they would reject. So we are helping to overcome this kind of paradox situation by building light nodes and so forth.Energy Web GovernanceGovernance is a very, very important topic, because we are in the process of actually decentralizing ourselves, since we do not want to decide on something as crucial as the backbone of the whole energy market as a foundation. Obviously, there are very few people who know everything, there are only a couple of Vitaliks around the globe, and even then you probably do not want them to decide.Then there are app developers, they already know more, and then there are a lot of token holders, who do not know too much about the technology itself. Also, since many affiliates are large corporations, they were concerned with their financial liability if they vote for an update (or do not). We could not answer this question. It is impossible to put a financial number to this, because you do not know how big the network is going to be, and what kind of applications are going to run there.So we came to the conclusion, why not let the application developers decide, those who make the network most useful. Therefore there is a Dapp being developed by Christoph Jentzsch which is measuring gas spendings over time, and the more successful the application, the heavier your vote counts in the upgrade decision. Immediately, there are at least ten arguments anyone can come up with how you could game the system. If you have a Crypto Kitties in this scenario, is now Crypto Kitties deciding everything? We are going to figure it out, we are deploying it, and there are a couple of measures we want to install to prevent that behavior. We are going to test it in the next couple of months. And we are going to bring some Ether through the bridge into the game, and we are going to see how they behave if there is real money involved.So, Energy Web 2.0 is something that Gavin presented today. We believe that the PoA chain is kind of an interim play. If you look at Ethereum, it is roughly at 80% of its capacity. So with PoA, we are roughly at 35x in terms of throughput, and in terms of gas cost, once we launch, probably only 1/1000 of the cost on Ethereum. We believe this capacity will suffice for another year, but not more, because we have seen all the applications from our affiliates, and their requirements in transactions per second. The only way forward is the next development step in the blockchain space, where every application will have its own product chain. And it absolutely makes sense, because there are a lot of applications where you want to do a lot of micro transactions, and a DAG chain is actually very useful for that, but then you need a virtual machine, a lot of logic. So I would be happy as an application developer if I could use different technologies and do not have to decide myself for any of the kind of platforms that are treated as a religion of sorts.Energy startup distributionLooking at the application side, out of the 250 startups and utilities, large corporations, nearly 60% are going into peer-to-peer trading. However, we are probably two to four years away from peer-to-peer trading at scale, in terms of the scalability of the chain. So if you want to go towards peer-to-peer trading, where really price discovery is done in smart contracts, the requirements are simply too high for current blockchains. Think about decentralized exchanges (DEX), that is something the ecosystem is developing towards, but only for one market. In energy, we are looking at thousands of markets. It is simply impossible currently.The second majority is actually going into refinancing assets, and this is an area I think is very interesting. Blockchain so far has been useful in raising a lot of money very fast. So why not do that to refinance renewable assets, tokenizing assets, sharing ownership. Especially for developing countries, a very interesting model. But therefore we need regulations to develop on the security side.Business model disruptionWhat is the most difficult, though, as I said before, is to make people understand what kind of new business models are possible. The above chart is a very famous chart on business model development. And you usually have these three steps. At the beginning, you have a new innovation, then market consolidation happens, and then the next innovation starts to commoditize the previous innovation.Now, if we see that blockchain is kind of commoditizing networks, then the energy market is actually ahead of the networks. So if you listen to the large corporations, or the vendor side, you always here this sentence \u201cwe are building the next Google for the energy market\u201d. The problem is, in the energy market, you are the best trader if you know exactly what is going on right *now*. So if there would be a Google in the energy market, Google would be the best energy trader. And therefore a lot of utilities are very afraid of those parties which have already assets in place and see the data, they are afraid to connect their assets to an analytics company from a large vendor, because there is fear that this vendor in five to ten years could become an energy trader as well.And then there is the alternative possibility, with blockchain you can build a decentralized operating system, you do not have to give up sovereignty over your data. At the same time, we have to explain that there is also evolution in the blockchain happening. So for me, we are now in the second abstraction. The first use case was very simple, that was a currency. The second is kind of a general tool of this, like Ethereum and so forth. And after that, we see all the specialized chains like Hashgraph, IOTA, EOS, etc. and you basically have to decide for one of the ecosystems. Now, for us, what Polkadot does, and Kosmos, is actually the next abstraction, it is commoditizing the blockchains. We do not have to decide for one of them, because now I can use Substrate and choose the technology I need for my application. We have these two developments, on the one side the old mindset of the energy market, and on the other side the very fast paced development in the blockchain space.There are a couple of frameworks we have built. One is the certificate of origin, a very simple framework that puts a light node into an asset and just captures one signal, namely how much energy is injected into the grid, and then puts this number into an order book, and then on the other side of the order book, who took this asset and consumed it. This process is done on paper right now, around the globe, and the smallest product that is being traded right now is 1 MWh. Putting this onto a smart contract, the product can become as small as you want. And it is bringing massive liquidity into this market, and we have just signed a very large deal with one of the large companies in this space, with the idea to establish the registration and trading backend on Energy Web for this entity. So the majority of the applications are either going into creating liquidity in smaller products or making use of assets more efficiently.Energy Web Foundation Founders & PartnersThe foundation was created by the Rocky Mountain Institute and Grid Singularity, and the partners we are working with are Parity Technologies and slock.it. We have the goal to decentralize ourselves, and we have the goal to be as transparent as possible, and therefore there is a Foundation Council which is concerned with the mission of the foundation, and then there is the executive team for the delivery.EWF AffiliatesFor the affiliates, there are very different motivations why they joined the foundation. The majority of large corporations joined to learn, to understand how this might disrupt their business, and what are the new possibilities, what are the new degrees of freedom. Startups typically join for a completely different reason. Startups join because of the license. VCs join because of the token. There is a lot of interaction between those different parties within the foundation. So the reason parties are joining us, and that is how we structured the foundation, joining us and signing a memorandum of understanding (MoU) entitles the affiliate to four things:EWF support with education, frameworks, etc.EWF gives away tokens against paymetn; so, affiliation is actually the token sale.EWF grants a special license; if you start embedding light nodes and data loggers, the GPL3 prevents that you create proprietary software on the light node. So you need something like LGPL. This license if being granted by becoming an affiliate.Parties are also entitled to run an authority.EWF licenseThis is the license. If you want to get rid of the copyleft and the GPL3 on the Partiy client, this is one of the ways, you become an affiliate. It comes with the condition that the application is running on Energy Web.Please see also the following Web3 Summit reports:Robert Habermeier: Implications of InteroperabilityFive reasons why Tezos rocks!If you found value in this article, please \u201cclap\u201d (up to 50 times).This article is part of our Tokyo FinTech Publication, please follow us to read more from our writers, like hundreds of readers do every day.

Most organizations aim to solve it with a top-down solution. We are finding that identity seems to form in \u201cpockets\u201d in the web3 space and a top-down overarching identity solution doesn\u2019t seem to be the right approach.Second, onboarding is rough. A user must download an extension, have ETH, understand gas, etc. We need a way for users to start interacting in a cryptographically backed fashion on page load with no prior knowledge. Finally, when they are incentivized to upgrade their security, they should have a web3 provider that best suites them.TL;DR: I\u2019m helping Civil and Consensys build a web3 abstraction and bottom-up identity solution for the Ethereum ecosystem that developers can incorporate in their website with a single line of code. You will get instant onboarding, web3 provider optionality for their users, and super simple attestation signing/verifying/aggregating. I need your feedback!Instant OnboardingWith a single line of code, a developer can bring in the Kirby package. On page load, an ephemeral key pair (burner!) is generated inside a child iframe for a user and the developer can begin signing messages and storing/validating off-chain attestations. This system could also be used to sign meta transactions for on-chain interactions.Logging in with Ethereum will as easy as kirby.sign(\u201clogin message\u201d)The end user won\u2019t need ETH, won\u2019t have to understand gas, and will be in full control of their identities and how they relate. They will use an Ethereum key pair to cryptographically sign a message. Then, when the user is ready to upgrade their security, they can choose from providers:Web3 Provider OptionalityMany different web3 providers are emerging in the Ethereum ecosystem and we need to allow users and developers the optionality to choose which is best to suit their needs. First, we will use something like eth-provider to detect if they already have a preferred injected web3 provider. Then, we\u2019ll check cookies for any stored preferences. Finally, we\u2019ll revert to web3connect:The web3connect package allows us to bring in all major providers including MetaMask, Portis, Fortmatic, Wallet Connect, etc. After using the default ephemeral key pair, a user can \u201cupgrade\u201d their security to a web3connect provider. An attestation would then be signed to connect the two accounts and a record is added to the DID identity store.Bottom-Up IdentityIt is important that identity is created on a per-service basis first and connections/permissions can be built up and owned by the user.To this end, the identity servers or attestation storage system will need to be distributed; many different organizations can run their own or we could even put it in 3Box! At first we will probably default to a single instance, but developers and users will have the ability to select where their identity exists.These DIDs are used to associate accounts with each other but also provide authentication and verifiable credentials. It\u2019s paramount that the user owns their own data but can give permission to an organization like Civil to build aggregate identity on top of groups of claims.Kirby digesting all of those caloric attestations to deliver a self-sovereign aggregated identity.Simple/Powerful Web3 AbstractionsOur goal is to provide an EIP1193 compliant web3 ethereum-provider to the developer, but also a handful for easy-to-use abstractions for signing, verifying, sending tokens, watching for events, and general smart contract interactions.ArchitectureThis one-line package will bring in a child iframe that can communicate through the postMessage interface. There are a couple packages that demonstrate how to make web3 interactions through iframes and we will use them as reference implementations. Civil has also written some code that might help.Inside the iframe we can route requests in three different ways:Validation/DIDIf the developer is wishing to authenticate, validate an attestation, or authorize an organization, it will load from the ID server/storage.ReadsIf the request is a simple web3 read, this can go directly to Infura or other web3 infrastructure.WritesIf the request is to sign or send a transaction, the ephemeral key pair will be used at first. As the user upgrades, these requests will be passed to their chosen provider from web3connect.PackagesYou\u2019ll notice in our repo that there are a number of extensible packages with the following architecture:Of course, initially, a developer will just be bringing in the SDK and calling functions on it, but eventually, you can start thinking about adding your own branding and functionality to the child iframe itself.First ImplementationThe first implementation in the wild will be by Civil. The Kirby SDK allows Civil to provide a consistent web3 experience to any of the publishers on their Registry.SecurityIt is important that the third party website (parent iframe) doesn\u2019t have full access to Kirby (child iframe). The ephemeral key pair will be stored in local storage, so if multiple sites are using Kirby we will have to create an authentication scheme to prevent any cross-site attacks.When talking with RicMoo he mentioned that the parent should probably bring the child in with some sort of auth token in the url. I think this probably has something to do with Content-Security-Policies. Still researching!Private Key in Local Storage!?!Yes! We are keeping an ephemeral \u201csigning\u201d key in local storage. This is an obvious attack vector but we believe that instant onboarding is worth it. The private key will only be used to sign attestations and won\u2019t hold any value. It can even be burned or removed from a user\u2019s identity if they so choose. The goal is to give a user a method to cryptographically prove their actions and to control their own data on page load without any previous knowledge of Ethereum.Once a user has earned value or created a narrative behind this insecure key, they will upgrade to a better form of signing and burn the ephemeral identity. These \u201cburner\u201d key pairs will always be created on page load like a session and the user has full control of linking ephemeral actions to their colder identity.Open Source & Open To FeedbackThis document is incomplete and we are open to any and all feedback on how to correctly implement this to be as effective as possible for the Ethereum ecosystem.My hope is that a new developer could bring in one line and have a simple \u201csign in\u201d system as a hello world. Their users would be instantly onboarded with a key pair, have the option to upgrade, and be connected to Ethereum.Please reach out directly to @austingriffith on Twitter or Telegram!Our code repository is: https://github.com/joincivil/kirbyTHANKS FOR THE GREAT ADVICE FROM:Pedro Gomes, Moody Salem, Brian Ethier, RicMoo, Pelle Braendgaard, Rouven Heck, Jonny Howle, Matthew Iles, Dan Kinsley, serapath, Jordan Muir, and of course @Mitch_Kosowski#GreatestTraderOFALLTIME\ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\ude0e", "responses": 3, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Kirby", "Identity", "Optionality", "Web3"]}, {"title": "How Patreon Used Bootleg to Turn Live Performances into the Gift That Keeps Giving for Cash-Strapped Musicians", "post_link": "https://medium.com/web3studio/how-patreon-used-bootleg-to-turn-live-performances-into-the-gift-that-keeps-giving-for-672713b4ae36?source=search_post", "author_name": "John Wolpert", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@jwolpert", "publish_date": "2019-01-13", "last_modified_date": "2019-02-07", "readtime": "9.27", "claps": 329, "voters": 38, "content": "How Patreon Used Bootleg to Turn Live Performances into the Gift That Keeps Giving for Cash-Strapped MusiciansAnother Story from the Near Future by ConsenSys Web3StudioJohn WolpertFollowJan 13 \u00b7 10 min readThis story is fiction\u2026for now.Photo by veeterzy on UnsplashEarl Potts is one of a new breed of concert goers. He\u2019s there for the show, for sure. But he\u2019s also there to make art \u2014 and a lot of money \u2014 as a Bootlegger, using his iPhone and Patreon\u2019s latest breakthrough service.A few years ago, Earl would have been thrown out of a concert for doing what he does. But now, he\u2019s the key to liberating bands from the treadmill of having literally to sing for their supper.A Brief History of Music EconomicsDecades ago, musicians could dream of getting a hit on the radio, selling records and reaping the royalties. Then came mp3s and streaming services, which promised even less friction for selling songs. But things didn\u2019t turn out well for musicians, who saw music revenues drop by two-thirds since their peak in 1999. Since then, the music industry flipped from groups playing concerts in order to promote record sales to groups peddling CDs and t-shirts at concerts. Ticket sales became their only real money-maker.This reduced musicians economically to the status of taxi driver. They could make a percentage off ticket sales but gave a lot of that up to ticket outlets and venue organizers. And concerts only generated revenue while the band was healthy and happy to live on the road.Without record sales, they didn\u2019t have a repeatable business model.Patreon, co-founded by legendary musician and Silicon Valley tech exec, Jack Conte, started to flip things back to a recurring revenue model for creators in 2017. Patreon\u2019s first service was a membership model that allowed musicians and other creators to raise funds from people who wanted to support their work\u2026patrons. It was like turning each creator into a mini public radio station (without the bi-annual pledge drives). This started the ball rolling, but by 2019, the model hadn\u2019t replaced the lost revenue of the golden days of record-sales and royalties.Conte and team are true innovators, both in music \u2014 go check out Pomplamoose and prepare to have your mind blown \u2014 and in business. They are constantly experimenting with new ways of increasing recurring revenue for creators.In 2020, Patreon entered into a relationship with Web3 pioneer, ConsenSys to launch Bootleg. And by 2021, Patreon\u2019s Bootleg service was flipping the music world upside down again.Here\u2019s how it worksBootleg is all about scarcity-marketing, a thing that became popular with the advent of blockchain and digital assets. It works in three parts:Bootleg concert\u00a0seating;Submitting a Bootleg video and minting Bootleg tokens;Pay-it-backward \u2014 how the band and everyone who has ever held the token share revenue every time a Bootleg token changes hands.Bootleg SeatsUnlike in the past, when recording a concert risked you getting tapped on the shoulder by security, concerts today designate some seats as Bootleg seats. Venues did this at first by selling the seats at a premium or sometimes giving them away. But nowadays, most of these seats are auctioned to professional and semi-professional videographers like Earl, who use the Bootleg feature on Patreon to scan for these seats and bid on them.Film, Edit, UploadHolders of Bootleg tickets are permitted to film the concert. There are rules for this. For example, they can\u2019t bring in a big distracting rig with lights. Earl just uses his iPhone, but he takes the footage home and adds his own brand of color commentary, trivia and effects. People love Earl\u2019s live concert videos, which he brands \u201cEP3s.\u201dThe Rise of Scarcity MarketingHere\u2019s where things get interesting. Bootleggers like Earl can\u2019t release their content to services like YouTube or iTunes. If a Bootleg is caught on the open Internet, that Bootlegger is flagged and can no longer buy Bootleg seats.Instead, they submit their videos through the Bootleg service to the band. The band can reject the video, request changes, or grant a number of Bootleg tokens (more on the new Bootleg ERC tokens below).The band could grant Earl just one token or thousands. Each is a single right to sell that token \u2014 not the video\u2026the token \u2014 to someone else.Reviewing and approving these videos for bands in order to ensure compliance with band image requirements (and other considerations) has become a service unto itself. Small bands just do it themselves, but the big acts farm it out.Say the band grants Earl 100 Bootleg tokens. Bootleg renders Earl\u2019s footage into one big video file with, effectively, a slice cut out of it. That slice is made into 100 transactions on a sidechain rooted to the Ethereum mainnet, each with a payload containing a unique identifier based on the new Bootleg Token ERC standard. That blockchain record is the actual asset, and it\u2019s what makes the video you purchase unique and rare.Think of this like an artist that makes 100 copies of a print, then destroys the lithography plates and numbers each of the copies. Manufactured scarcity. You own #33 of 100 prints.The process renders the bulk video file unusable without combining it with one of the 100 unique records and the private key of the account currently holding one of those records. The video itself can be stored anywhere\u200a\u2014\u200aon conventional edge servers, Bittorrent, a thumb drive\u2026doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s just a blob of bits without that little extra slice of data sitting on the Ethereum mainnet that transforms it not simply into a watchable video but into Bootleg #33 of 100 of a specific concert. The holder of the account that buys #33 isn\u2019t really buying the video. They are buying a verified, unique digital asset, like a Bitcoin or a Cryptokitty, which confers both ownership rights and the ability to watch the video.Sure, you could buy one of the licenses, then tape the video while playing it and pirate it out, diluting the scarcity, but here\u2019s why you probably won\u2019t:Pay It BackwardWhen you buy #33 of, say, Earl\u2019s video of Pomplamoose\u2019s June 1 concert at the Greek Theater, what you\u2019re really buying is a right to a set of future cash flows, which occur whenever that little slice of the video stored on the blockchain\u200a\u2014\u200athe digital asset\u200a\u2014\u200ais sold. If you buy #33 from Earl\u00a0for\u00a0$10, the Bootleg smart contract will give Earl $8 and send $2 to the band\u2019s account.Each time a sale occurs, the band gets a percentage (say in this example, 20%) and the most recent holder \u2014 the seller \u2014 gets a percentage. Then the second most recent holder gets a percentage, and so on back to the original Bootlegger, Earl.Bootleg right now uses only one algorithm for this distribution, but word is that it\u2019s adding the ability for different payout schemes that bands can use for different purposes. For example, you could have everyone get the same percentage, or each successive holder could get a larger percentage. The percentage the band and the bootlegger take will also soon be something they can change.Concert Videos as Collectible? Really?At first, I never thought I\u2019d actually buy a concert video this way. The major concert videos of my favorite bands are all available on any number of streaming services.But Earl\u2019s awesome commentary and unique way of capturing the performance hooked me. And I love that only a few of us have ever\u200aseen it. Feels like I\u2019m in a special, tiny community. I\u2019m not just buying a tape of the concert I was at. I\u2019m buying Earl\u00a0and\u00a0my\u00a0position\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0chain\u00a0of\u00a0custody\u00a0for\u00a0this\u00a0one\u00a0experience. And now, I find myself buying Earl\u2019s EP3 Bootlegs (and a few others) for concerts I was never at, for bands I\u2019m just getting to know.Bands let Earl build this following, because he can\u2019t infringe on their mass market business model. Thanks to scarcity-marketing, Earl gets to build a lucrative, exclusive, small following that he can manage without being a global powerhouse of distribution maintaining millions of followers.Not all bootleggers do as well as Earl, of course. Earl has been making a living income while doing what he loves. Earl\u2019s main frustration today is that major music bloggers like Alex Ross and YouTube influencers like Jenna Marbles are starting to make their own bootlegs and earning legendary fees. Last month, Kim Kardashian herself posted a single bootleg that went for $25,000.Ed has never cleared more than $500 for a first-turn bootleg. Some of them go up in value (and some go down) with successive turns, but usually the initial sale is smaller. He sees famous people getting into bootlegging kind of like how they got into writing picture books for kids. It\u2019s annoying, and the quality isn\u2019t nearly as good as his work, but at least they\u2019re drawing attention to the craft. There definitely seem to be more buyers of bootlegs since the big names got into the act.Why Is This Good for Bands?The important thing to remember is that Earl and the other bootleggers wouldn\u2019t be allowed \u2014 or have a real incentive \u2014 to do what they do if it weren\u2019t for the modern stateful Internet\u2019s ability (thanks to hybrid public/private blockchain) to manufacture and enforce scarcity without locking buyers and sellers into one vendor\u2019s platform. Patreon is the app I use to buy bootlegs, sure, but the assets are not housed on Patreon\u2019s servers. I could just as easily sell someone my #33 EP3 straight on Ethereum or through any service trading Bootleg tokens. That increases trust that these assets are really mine forever.Any time a band can turn an unused resource into revenue without exploiting their fan base, it\u2019s probably a good thing. Concert goers can still buy recordings of the official concert footage at venue kiosks, usually for $9.95. And those who want to brave retribution can use their smartphone and post YouTube videos of the performance. Not supposed to happen, but it does.But the official concert video is a professional job produced only every-so-often and heavily marketed to get mass audience exposure. And it\u2019s just one asset, sold one time. Even if people tended to sell their recordings to someone else \u2014 which they don\u2019t \u2014 the band sees nothing from that transaction. And of course, the band makes zero off the personal \u201cpiracy\u201d of their fan\u2019s concert videos on YouTube and Facebook.The \u201cpay-it-backward\u201d Bootleg token, on the other hand, earns the band money with every sale, and every buyer has an incentive to sell it to someone else. Pretty neat trick.Future Plans \u2014 Streaming?One thing Bootleg gets asked a lot is how these \u201crare\u201d bootlegs could be set up for streaming. Streaming is a big thing in the age of Twitch having expanded from just games to live streaming everything from the local soccer match to the family dinner fight.The problem for Bootleg is how to keep the value of the bootlegs up for their rarity (which turned out to be the big surprise in the business\u2026it\u2019s amazing what people will pay a premium for if they think it\u2019s rare). If anyone can stream the video, then many people without the \u201cpay it backward\u201d incentive against copying will be able to set up a video-camera and make a copy for Bittorrent or YouTube.Bootleg\u2019s idea is that maybe a kind of reputation/attestation system could work. Each stream could have a digital watermark embedded in the video marking it as the nth owner\u2019s iteration of that #33 token. If that shows up anywhere outside bootleg, then it can be detected and the violator never gets to stream again\u2026you\u2019re locked out. But, of course, then you just create a new account or you run the video through software that detects and scrambles or removes the watermark, so that it\u2019s not obvious it was you. This idea may have to wait until self-sovereign identity is well established.Still, with all the money being made on bootlegs today, the company has a reasonable fund to research the problem and come up with a way for bootleggers to have their cake and eat it too: be allowed to tape the band\u2019s concert on the promise of not competing in the mass consumption business model (which most successful bands wants for themselves) while also getting additional revenue from viewers, not just collectors.Royalties and the Gift That Keeps GivingSales of merchandise are a sure thing, but they are a one-time event with only one asset. For a single concert, there can be hundreds of authorized bootleggers, each pushing their tokens. The band (and the bootlegger) make money not just once at a single point-of-sale but forever, with every turn of every asset. The revenue math on that is more complex than single-payment retail sales, but it is also far more compelling, with real potential to generate multiple streams of long-term cash flow from every authorized bootlegger at every concert.And now, the industry is waking up to the fact that the Bootleg token looks a lot like an ideal way to improve the way creators get royalties.It\u2019s not surprising that the Bootleg token standard (ERC) is now being considered as a foundation for the new global royalty system.The bootleg token model was conceived just for concert videos, but it really has become the gift that keeps giving, finding more and more uses in all kinds of business models in many industries.Web3Studio is a ConsenSys team that conceives and builds novel, innovative uses of blockchain and related technologies, so that the Ethereum and Web3 ecosystem can expand its horizons and build valuable ventures faster.Update: We just selected this as the team\u2019s next project to build open source tools for.

In an effort to make the ideas presented more digestible, we\u2019ve transcribed the video, included the slides, and edited down the text to its core ideas.After presenting Substrate and Polkadot, Gavin builds a custom blockchain in minutes using Substrate on a brand new MacBook Pro.Quick Links:Watch the full videoView the slidesWatch the Dotcon-0 workshopSubstrate Developer Hub & DocumentationJoin the Substrate chatWhat is Substrate and how does it relate to Polkadot?I think there\u2019s some confusion over what Substrate is and how it relates to Polkadot. This is meant to clear up some of that confusion. So how do they relate to each other?Basically, Polkadot is, in many respects, the biggest bet in this ecosystem against chain maximalism. I don\u2019t like chain maximalism in general. I consider it a sort of nationalist equivalent of blockchain. If I can do something helpful for this ecosystem, I would try to convince people that it\u2019s really not such a good plan to back one winner above all others. Even if there were one perfect chain, I don\u2019t think it would stay perfect for very long, and I don\u2019t think it would be helpful in general for people to try to create one. I consider this kind of maximalism basically just barriers to entry. Barriers to entry generally reduce innovation, and they reduce the fun for technologists.So, how do Substrate and Polkadot relate to each other? Well, these are separate technologies. They\u2019re designed to work together, but really, it\u2019s more of an optimization that they work together. It\u2019s not something fundamental about their design.PolkadotIf you want to think about it in analogies, you can think of Polkadot being more like the ethernet protocol and Substrate being more like the general IBM PC or Mac or whatever that uses the ethernet protocol in order to communicate between themselves. Polkadot is a specific protocol. There\u2019s a token associated with it that lets you pay for using that protocol. It\u2019s got many teams building, at least a couple of teams at the moment and hopefully many more, and multiple implementations. (Interested in building an implementation? Apply for a grant.)SubstrateSubstrate, on the other hand, is a technology stack. It\u2019s created originally by Parity Technologies, although since it is open source, I hope that we can sort of attract other people to contribute. We already have a few external community contributors. I hope we can get many more over the coming years. The idea with Substrate is that it\u2019s not used for any single network. It\u2019s used for many different chains with many different tokens and, in principle, could also be re-implemented in other languages.Looking at the Venn diagram, on the one hand you have Polkadot and the parachains of Polkadot. They don\u2019t need to be written on a Substrate stack, but they can be. We\u2019ll make it easy for you to do that but hopefully there will be other technologies that come along and that allow you to make Polkadot chains without using Substrate. Similarly for Substrate, the chains that you build with Substrate don\u2019t need to be used with Polkadot, we make it easy for them to be used in Polkadot, but in principle they can exist perfectly well on their own.This is a somewhat complex schematic. I don\u2019t expect you to understand all of it, but the basic point is that in both the Polkadot protocol and in the Substrate model you have this notion of an embedded runtime, or block validation function in the case of Polkadot. This is meant to be relatively analogous code, they do more or less the same thing, and because of this, we can start to see the sort of the analogous components between both Polkadot and Substrate.So, to give an example, both Polkadot and the parachains need both an RPC, they both need database, they both need synchronization algorithms, they both have a WebAssembly execution engine. These are common components, why should we build them twice \u2014 once for parachains, and once for the relay chain? Doesn\u2019t make any sense.If we go to the model of Polkadot version one \u2014 and this is the thing that I basically laid out in the Polkadot paper, about two years ago \u2014 the basic idea is that you have the consensus algorithm at the very bottom, that\u2019s whatever it is that\u2019s making sure that the chains don\u2019t fork off away from each other. You\u2019ve got the Polkadot runtime environment, which is the thing that looks after execution of the block and knows how to run the transactions. Then you\u2019ve got the relay chain\u2019s runtime, that\u2019s the thing that actually describes what Polkadot is, how it works to the runtime environment. Then you\u2019ve got the things that run sort of within the runtime, like the parachain consensus, making sure that the parachains are all correctly operating, that they\u2019re valid and so forth. That\u2019s on the relay chain side of things. On the parachain side of things you\u2019ve got the authoring and the synchronization mechanisms that actually bring forth the new blocks for the parachains to keep getting bigger, and that runs the parachain runtime environment and then the actual parachain runtime is the thing that decides what it is that the parachain, how it works, how it executes transactions, what the transactions mean, and how it executes blocks.If we go to the version two model of Polkadot, then we see that basically we\u2019re going to merge the parachain runtime and the Polkadot relay chain runtime into the same bit of code. When they become the same bit of code, or more importantly when all of the components around it can interpret them in the same way, then we can put a feedback loop between the parachain runtime and the relay chain runtime. That feedback loop is super important. It has a very particular thing that it achieves. It relates specifically to scalability. Version one of Polkadot can probably handle dozens of parachains, perhaps a 100.In version two of Polkadot the relay chains can be pluralistic where each of the parachains can itself be a relay chain, then we can introduce multiple levels of Polkadot. We end with something approaching this. We might have sort of the main relay chain at the top there. But on the first level there could be other relay chains, copies of that relay chain in terms of its operation. Those relay chains can then host their own 100 or whatever parachains. Some of those parachains might be relay chains as well. Others might be interesting state transition function chains, like maybe a plasma parachain. Maybe an Ethereum 2.0 parachain. Maybe a ZK-Snarks parachain. Who knows.Maybe you get to the bottom and you have a relay chain that\u2019s just full of parachains that are all for one specific consortium. So maybe something like an EWF set of chains but all basically run in a zone together.Now in building Polkadot and in building Substrate, we realized that we will fail in our mission of building a platform that is inclusive if we accidentally come into competition with other next-generation chains. We don\u2019t want that to happen.I believe that the difference between competition and cooperation is pretty much based in the technology, and specifically, based in the neutrality and freedom that you get from working on a platform. If a platform gives you the freedom to do what you would do otherwise, but yet, some additional advantages, perhaps, a speedier development, then you\u2019re more likely to use it.Substrate is generalWe\u2019re designing Substrate to have the maximum level of technical freedom, and you also get security and connectivity built in for free \u2014 with minimum efforts and constraints, and for that matter, the opinionation that can creep in if you\u2019re not careful when you design these platforms. I want to try and convince you that Substrate really is a general platform for building your next blockchain on.Why do I think this is a really general platform? Well, firstly, minor things like the block format. We have an abstract block format. As long as your block format sort of encodes the two or three or four specific values, things like parent hash, then you\u2019re good. You can put whatever else in it that you want. It\u2019s extensible.It\u2019s agnostic to the underlying crypto databases. You can choose our very Ethereum-like Merkle Patricia Tree. You can have another, any of the other crypto databases that we write for the various parachains that we want to make. You can introduce your own, that\u2019s perfectly fine. You can organize these dynamically in any way that you want. If you want to have hierarchical trees, then you\u2019re perfectly at liberty to do that.It\u2019s got an execute block function. Now, in general, blockchains have an execute block function. That\u2019s one of the sort of notable constants of blockchains. And we provide a 100% abstract execute block function. You give it data, like a block, and it executes it. It\u2019s encoded in Web Assembly, which can be targeted from anyone of a number of languages including C++ and Rust. I don\u2019t think it could be possible to make a more general execute block API. But if you have ideas, let me know. It also has extensible networking and extensible CLI and RPC. So if you want to put in interesting things for managing your networking, maybe managing peer sets, maybe introducing your CLI options, introducing your RPC calls, it\u2019s all good.What about consensus? Well, we also have that generalized as well. There\u2019s an API provided. You can sort of roll your own consensus mechanism if you want. We\u2019ve taken quite a lot of time and iteration to make sure that this API can handle probably most interesting consensus algorithms out there. We also provide a few of our own. Rhododendron, which is our blockchain context of PBFT, is in there. Aurand, which you might have heard of if you\u2019ve been using Kovan or any of the sort of a parity POA tools, is probabilistic finality consensus algorithm. We\u2019ve also included GRANDPA, our new consensus algorithm that\u2019s going to power Polkadot, and we\u2019re planning on adding Ouroboros and Proof-of-Work.Substrate\u2019s advantagesIf I\u2019ve convinced you it\u2019s general, then now I need to convince you of its advantages. So what do you get? Well, you get hot-swappable, pluggable consensus. You can change your consensus mechanism on the fly. So if you want to start it with Aurand and then you want to add finality down the line with GRANDPA, that\u2019s perfectly fine. You want to switch it from that to become a parachain? Well, we want to make that work as well.It\u2019s got a hot-upgradable, pluggable state transition function. What do I mean by hot-upgradable? Well, I mean that you can launch your chain and then down the line you can change what it is that your chain does, how it works without a hard fork.It\u2019s got a light client. You just get a light client for free. You want to use it on mobile, you\u2019re good. It can work. You get chain synchronization, Pub/Sub RPC, transaction queues, all that sort of general stuff, pervasive and secure networking by virtue of the libp2p protocol. You get a Javascript implementation if you like Javascript, and you get our runtime module library, which lets you take from our library, I think there\u2019s about a dozen modules now, and that\u2019s growing all the time in order to build your perfect runtime. Of course, you get interchain connectivity by virtue of the Polkadot protocol.The SRML, which is our Substrate Runtime Module Library, this is the way that you can sort of take off the shelf components, plug them together, and build yourself a blockchain that does what you want it to do. We have a bunch of components already made. The idea is to get each of these audited in turn so that they can be used as common building blocks. They can have UI sort of analogs as well so that you can plug in common Javascript components in order to make really easy, really rapid developed applications.You\u2019ve got things like accounts and balances so that you can make a cryptocurrency. That was one of the many use cases. You can also use sessions. There\u2019s a staking algorithm so you can use proof of stake. It\u2019s got things like treasuries, which is a little bit like the DAO. It\u2019s got a smart contract module, so if you want to put smart contracts in there, you just include that. It\u2019s got various things to do with on-chain governance. At the moment we have a couple of modules for referendums and managing a sort of delegated council. You want to add arbitrary fungible assets, we\u2019ve got a module for that as well. But, as I said, these things are being constantly developed and we want to turn this into a very reasonably large library.So the problem is that when you\u2019re coming up with these platforms, these APIs and protocols, you end up with a trade-off. On the one end you\u2019ve got like minimum effort like, I want everything just done for me. I can configure it with a JSON file and like choose which bits I want and that\u2019s it, all sorted. Then on the other hand, you also want to provide maximum freedom, which is like well, I really want to do X, Y, and Z, and maybe you didn\u2019t think of that when you designed the protocol, when you design the APIs, so how is it that I can do that.Really, we want to get both: maximum freedom with minimum effort. The way to get both at least that we\u2019re using is to have a multi-layered architecture. At the top level there is where you\u2019ve got like the maximum amount of freedom but also the maximum amount of effort that you have to put in. That\u2019s for stuff basically you start with Substrate Core. That gives you a bunch of stuff but it makes your life of building a blockchain a lot easier than it would be if you started from scratch. But you don\u2019t get anything really finally made for you.In the middle you\u2019ve got the Runtime Module Library. So that basically means that you can use Core, add the runtime modules to it, and you end up with something that\u2019s much easier to get something working, and still has a decent amount of freedom. You can make your own runtime modules if you want. You can hack up a code if you want, that\u2019s fine. But it is more opinionated so you have to fall in with the architectural decisions that we made in that library.Finally, that is Substrate Node, which is our sort of maximum ease, maximum opinionation. You configure it with a JSON file, it kind of does what you expect. It deploys a blockchain pretty easily.If you have the Bare Polkadot sort of parachain, then you give a block validation function, which has to be in WebAssembly. Then you give it some collator nodes, which basically provide these candidate blocks and you have to do everything. You have to do RPC databases, syncing, all of that stuff.If you use Substrate Core, then you start to provide this execute block function written in basically in Wasm. You can write in Rust, C++ whatever you want, but you still have to sort of write it all yourself. And you also have to provide any networking block authoring stuff if what we give you isn\u2019t sufficient, and you get a bunch of stuff. You get RPCs, databases. You get telemetry. You get the light client, pluggable consensus, upgradability and a bunch of other things.If you go for the Substrate Runtime Module Library, then you get a bunch of modules to select from, but you have to select them, you have to configure them, give them parameters, and you get a load of front-end help. You get block authoring and transaction queue. You get the ability to have a JSON configuration file automatically made for you that just works with your eventual executable. You get a chain explorer that will work with all of your runtime modules. You get event tracking, which I\u2019ll probably touch on in the workshop.Finally, if you just use Substrate Node, then you provide a JSON config file and you get a blockchain.So, with regards to Polkadot and Substrate, there are basically three options that you get. You get a solo chain, a solo chain and a bridge, or you get a parachain. There are differing levels of sovereignty and connectedness.Solo chain is self-sovereign. It doesn\u2019t connect to anything else. It just lives on its own.Solo chain with a bridge to it (basically bridges are modules the solo chain listens to) can listen to Polkadot, and basically provides a level of intercommunication between the two. It retains its sovereignty and it\u2019s up to the bridge to basically explain to Polkadot what that sovereignty means. Problem with it, of course, is you don\u2019t get the security that Polkadot would otherwise offer.Finally, as a parachain, you get to use the relay chain\u2019s consensus or any of whichever one that you put it on, if it\u2019s not the top-level relay chain and it uses the validation for that. You don\u2019t need to incentivize your users economically. That job\u2019s already done because you\u2019re piggybacking on the relay chain\u2019s consensus. It\u2019s sovereign over state transition still. It\u2019s just not sovereign over finality.Next I want to very quickly talk about parachain set governance with Polkadot, since that seems to be something that people are quite interested in knowing. Version one of Polkadot probably hosts several dozen parachains, perhaps, let us say perhaps up to 100. So, that\u2019s limited capacity, 10 or 20 slots to be reserved for some of the future chains, leaving perhaps 80, and they\u2019ll be leased. So, it\u2019s not a sale, it\u2019s a lease. You put in some DOTs and you get the DOTs back when the lease is over. The idea is that there\u2019s a quadratic curve. It\u2019s a polynomial curve and it goes up as fewer parachain slots become free.Parachains can be added through edict of referenda. So, you can just have a referendum to say, \u201cYeah, we, the people, the coin holders, believe this parachain should be introduced.\u201d Or you can take up one of those slots by putting down DOT tokens, and you specify desired lease period. Once the leases can be exchanged, i.e. if a parachain comes to the end of its period you can create an arrangement whereby you take the lease off them, and once it\u2019s ended, the chain is retired. If all of the slots are leased, it goes to an auction. If they\u2019re not, then it just gets added back into the free slots and the effective price for taking a parachain goes down.So, the roadmap: We\u2019re very close to releasing PoC-3, Substrate is going to have a release once we\u2019ve integrated our new consensus, and that will be called the 1.0 Beta. PoC-4 is scheduled for some time between January and February next year, and that will include inter-chain communication, and we are also planning on making the 1.0 release candidate for Substrate, with the 1.0 candidate following basically after the key components have been audited.Things get a little bit more difficult to predict the future, but basically PoC-5 should see something of a bringing together of Polkadot parachain collator software and the Substrate software. So basically the Substrate can start to be the collator nodes that can start off a parachain consensus. While that\u2019s going on, we\u2019ll be working on the things like the Ethereum bridge and a few other infrastructure components with a hopeful date for a 1.0 release candidate beginning of July next year and still on for a genesis block at some point between September and October. So get Substrate and launch your chain.Go more in depth on Substrate. Watch the Substrate workshop from Web3 Summit:Ready to start experimenting with Substrate?

Right around the time the platform became mired in scandal for doing what most knew what it was doing anyway \u2014 selling users\u2019 intimate data to the highest bidder \u2014 it was announced that Facebook had banned all promotion of posts relating in any way to cryptocurrency or digital currency. \u201cThis policy is intentionally broad while we work to better detect deceptive and misleading advertising practices,\u201d noted Facebook\u2019s statement.Exacted under the banner of inhibiting scam ICOs from luring vulnerable Facebookers into parting with their hard-earned BTC or ETH in fraudulent token launches, the draconian move has in effect stymied the communication capacities of thousands of genuine and worthwhile startups by inhibiting the promotion of content that features any phrase even vaguely related to blockchain and decentralization in its headline.Next came Google Ads. Then Twitter. And then Mailchimp! What\u2019s resulted is an effective blockchain marketing blackout on platforms that make up much of the internet experience for most of the Western world. A blanket ban on all promotion of blockchain-related pages, regardless of whether they represent an ICO at all, functions less as a safety measure and more as an unprecedented act of censorship against a whole technology that should cause alarm to anyone watching how fast this late period of Web 2.0 is unraveling.The situation has elicited a spectrum of reactions from around the blockchain world. Many have come out against the move. Some take the high road, claiming either that the industry needs to be exorcised of its scammier demons or that we don\u2019t need those aging 2.0 platforms anyway. Almost universal, though, is a sense of surprise at the sheer breadth and severity, particularly when companies like Facebook and Google are purportedly looking into blockchain technology themselves, and an understanding that this is just another sign that there is still lots of building to be done to make the world in the image of decentralization.\u201cCentralized platforms give themselves this right because of how they are architected,\u201d says Ariella Steinhorn of Blockstack. \u201cWe voluntarily hand over data that should be our own, and agree to their terms because there are no other options. But instead of seeing this as an obstacle, Steinhorn says \u201cBlockstack is focused on funding decentralized projects and promoting usage of decentralized apps that including private messaging platforms, word processors, social media networks, and wallets.\u201d Inspiring as this vision of a blockchain world is, it comes with an implication that the building will be done in spite of or in opposition to the legacy internet rather than with it.Blockstack\u2019s growing suite of decentralized apps aims to create updated versions of social tech stalwarts.How did we get here? The situation is a goopy melange of monopoly, censorship, and enterprise gamesmanship. Facebook has long since manipulated its algorithms to require professional pages \u2014 be they DJs, politicians, blockchain startups \u2014 to spend more and more to reach audiences. In fact, achieving reach within Facebook\u2019s audience analytics widget by pumping dollars into the right demographic (dare we say \u2018psychographic\u2019?) is now the major tenet of the whole digital marketing profession. Ads drove over $40 billion in profit for Facebook in 2017, and the platform has become the de facto information source for many of its 2.1 billion users.Facebook\u2019s monopolistic hegemony over information led Rolling Stone\u2019s Matt Taibbi to state last week: \u201cWe need to break up Facebook, the same way we broke up Standard Oil, AT&T and countless other less-terrifying overgrown corporate tyrants of the past. The moral if not legal reason is obvious: A functioning free press just can\u2019t coexist with an unaccountable private regulator.\u201dFacebook\u2019s reach algorithms and censorship policies are conducted in secret, with minimal accountability transparency despite its role as the informational regulator of the western world for people aged 18\u201345. This means that the company\u2019s blind spots, missteps, and oversights result in very real problems offline. Case in point: If Facebook went after Russian hackers with half the vigor with which it has gone after crypto, we likely would not have found ourselves in the dire political situation we\u2019re in today. It is, in fact, easier to advertise illegal opioids, sketchy diet pills, and hate speech on Facebook than it is to market a blockchain app. Something is very wrong here.All of this isn\u2019t even to mention the red herring of scam ICOs in the first place. Yes, phishing, scamming, and a general lack of accountability and ethics are legitimate problems in the blockchain space. But for some total newbie to get scammed by an ill-intentioned ICO advertising on Facebook \u2014 the problem that Facebook\u2019s ham-handed blanket ban alleges to solve \u2014 that newbie would have to create an account at Coinbase, link their bank, buy ETH, wait a week, create a wallet, learn at least the basics of transacting on the blockchain, and then participate in a live token sale for the scam to even kick in.Photo via Rodon KutsaevAlthough platforms like Facebook and Twitter garnered most of the headlines in banning advertisement of blockchain projects, email automation giant Mailchimp took things one step further by banning blockchain-based clients entirely. The story first broke when it came out that Week in Ethereum, a long-running stalwart of sober and informative blockchain development news, was to be booted from the platform.\u201cWe recognize that blockchain technology is in its infancy and has tremendous potential,\u201d Mailchimp PR rep Lauren Lloyd communicated via an official statement. \u201cNonetheless, the promotion and exchange of cryptocurrencies is too frequently associated with scams, fraud, phishing, and potentially misleading business practices at this time\u2026 It\u2019s important to note that this update to our policy does not prevent the discussion of related topics in messages sent through our platform. For example, journalists and publications may send cryptocurrency-related information as long as they\u2019re not involved in the production, sale, exchange, storage, or marketing of cryptocurrencies.\u201dThe last line in particular, which was not included in their initial statement, suggests there may be some wiggle room in what Mailchimp deems appropriate. Unfortunately, that was not the case for Week in Ethereum. Evan Van Ness, who has run Week in Ethereum for two years, was magnanimous despite the obstacle: \u201cI\u2019m sympathetic to the fact that they want to remove scammy clients. That can affect their core business,\u201d he explained. \u201cAs for Week in Ethereum, I\u2019ve been with them for almost two years. The fact that they were too lazy to do any sort of filtering for an account with a 66% open rate and 0% reporting spam is what I find ridiculous. They\u2019re, theoretically, a tech company after all. To be honest, I wanted to quit Mailchimp anyway. They\u2019re expensive for the services they provide, and this is an opportunity to find a better partner.\u201dAnd those better partners are popping up. Creative-focused upstart email automator ConvertKit is offering a discount code for blockchain businesses thinking of switching over. \u201cI was really surprised to see so many tech giants exact such wide ranging measures on a technology that\u2019s clearly becoming a key part of how things get built in the world,\u201d says Barrett Brooks, COO of ConvertKit. \u201cWe want to be a viable alternative, an email provider for the future, not the past. A huge part of the future of commerce and creativity is going to be built on blockchain technology. We understand that. By no means do we think that we need to outlaw anything to do with blockchain to make sure our platform remains secure. We\u2019re gonna be here for the creators using blockchain productively to create value in the world, and we\u2019re making sure we shut down accounts that are takers and fraudulently taking people\u2019s money.\u201dPhoto via Rami al-ZayatNow, does this mean there is some terrible and evil deep tech conspiracy to block out blockchain tech before it has a chance to flourish? Probably not. At least explicitly. More likely, tech, social media, and community platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Mailchimp suffer from a general distrust of the blockchain movement. With the outlook of tech giants suddenly blotted by the struggles of their solutions growing so big that they have become part of a whole new problem, this new wave of technology undoubtedly presents a scary proposition. There may be no conspiracy, but there will be no quarter given either \u2014 at least until they figure out how they can profit from it.So the question still has to be asked: What are social tech giants so afraid of? Web 2.0 tech giants have built their world-beating business models from creating an attention economy, commodifying users, surveilling their usage, and owning the data. Web3 platforms, from BAT to uPort to SingularDTV to Civil, chip away at this business model. Each blockchain project that decentralizes a little bit of agency or value or control back into the hands of the users is a threat to the status quo. If 2018 has shown us anything, it is a clear public desire for control over digital identity, footprint, and the creation and transaction of value online. Web 2.0 platforms exist to maintain control over such things.The decentralized evolution is happening. Whether or not Facebook or Twitter try to control its course, when blockchain platforms begin to come good on their potential, Web 2.0 will already be a thing of the past. That\u2019s just how it goes. Remember AOL? And the blockchain world is fighting back. Already, blockchain coalitions ranging from Russia to China and South Korea have banded together to file lawsuits in the US against four social media giants, and more are on the way. Meanwhile, according to The Economist, the European Commission and countries like France and Germany are readying legislation to limit Facebook, and Attorneys General from a handful of states including Missouri, have opened up inquiries into Google\u2019s monopoly on information.In truth, oversight of the circus-like atmosphere around speculative and shady ICOs is a good thing. Regulatory bodies are catching on \u2014 some faster than others \u2014 to the fact that blockchain and digital currency should be sensibly developed rather than marginalized. As more blockchain applications provide real world benefits and more people grow wise to ICO scammers, legacy social media platforms won\u2019t be scrambling to inhibit the promotion of blockchain tech on their platforms; they\u2019ll be scrambling to integrate the tech itself.Wanna learn more about the future of the entertainment industry?Check out SingularDTV.com, read our Blog, like us on Facebook. and take part in creating a decentralized entertainment economy\u2026", "responses": 2, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Facebook", "Social Media", "Technology", "Decentralization"]}, {"title": "The R_Block team", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@zinc_ship/the-r-block-team-32583a017cc6?source=search_post", "author_name": "Luke Shipley", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@zinc_ship", "publish_date": "2018-01-23", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-20", "readtime": "2.51", "claps": 272, "voters": 16, "content": "The R_Block teamLuke ShipleyFollowJan 23, 2018 \u00b7 3 min readR_Block is a decentralized anonymous careers network, powered by a blockchain based referencing dApp. We believe in the world of Web3.0 everybody will be rewarded for sharing their time and data.

This contains your contract bytecode, which you\u2019ll use below.Now you have the bytecode for your contract, let\u2019s deploy it!Deploy your ContractThis is really easy using the GoChain Wallet:Go to https://wallet.gochain.io/In the top right, choose TestNetClick Open WalletPaste your private key for your testnet wallet that has the GO you got from our TelegramClick Deploy ContractCopy the contents of MyToken.bin into the Bytecode fieldClick Send!After a few seconds your contract will be deployed and you\u2019ll get a contract address, copy the address and save it somewhere. That address is what people will use to interact with your contract.Next StepsAfter you\u2019ve deployed your contract, you\u2019ll want to use it. There are many ways people can interact with your contracts, whether it\u2019s sending GO directly to it, using the GoChain Wallet, using MyEtherWallet, or using a DApp that uses it. We won\u2019t go into that in this post as we could write several other posts on that part and it depends on what your contract does.We know it can be intimidating to know where to start when you first get into developing smart contracts, I hope this post helps you see how easy it can be.More documentation at: https://github.com/gochain-io/docsLearn more about GoChain at https://gochain.ioJoin our Telegram GroupFollow us on Social!TwitterMediumRedditCrunchbaseInstagramFacebookBitcoin Talk", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Gochain", "Smart Contracts", "Solidity", "Blockchain"]}, {"title": "Identity: The Elephant in the Enterprise Blockchain Room", "post_link": "https://medium.com/hackernoon/identity-the-elephant-in-the-enterprise-blockchain-room-6f31ed8d4132?source=search_post", "author_name": "Jesus Rodriguez", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@jrodthoughts", "publish_date": "2019-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2019-04-04", "readtime": "6.68", "claps": 73, "voters": 19, "content": "Identity: The Elephant in the Enterprise Blockchain RoomJesus RodriguezFollowApr 4 \u00b7 7 min readThe adoption of permissioned blockchain technologies in the enterprise is a road full of challenges. The so called Web3 stack based on decentralized ledgers is still fundamentally immature to enable sophisticated enterprise business processes. Among the building blocks missing from enterprise blockchain platforms, identity raises to the top of the list as one of the omnipresent challenges of this new generation of enterprise solutions. At Invector Labs, we are regularly faced with the challenges of enabling identity management capabilities in permissioned blockchain solutions. As a result, we have developed certain ideas of the key capabilities and models of an identity layer for enterprise blockchain solutions which I would like to outline in this article.Over the last five years, the identity management space experienced a renaissance with the emergence of a new generation of technologies that transition from complex systems such as CA or Microsoft Active Directory to more open, API driven platforms like Okta, Ping Identity, One Login as well as the corresponding stacks in the cloud platforms like AWS, Azure or Google Cloud. These platforms shifted the capabilities of identity from proprietary systems to open protocols such as SAML, OpenID Connect and others. However, this doesn\u2019t mean enterprise identity management technologies are simple and easy to use. Quite the opposite, with the evolution of identity capabilities it also came an increase in the complexity of the requirements of identity management solutions. If look at the current spectrum of identity management architectures in the enterprise, there are a few characteristics that are worth highlighting:\u00b7 Based on Centralized Identity Providers: Enterprise identity management solutions typically rely on centralized identity providers that receive some form of user credentials as input and output an identity token.\u00b7 Based on Identity Protocols: At the moment, a significant percentage of enterprise identity management solutions leverage protocols like SAML, OAuth2 for its interactions.\u00b7 Fractionalized: The identity of users in enterprise environments is spread across different line of business systems or user directories. As a result, different applications tend to interact with different representations of a user\u2019s identity.Fundamental Frictions to Enable Identity in Permissioned BlockchainsPutting all these pieces together, we get a picture in which the identity of users in the enterprise is distributed across many systems but enforced by central identity providers. When comes to identity, there are two fundamental frictions that need to be addressed between the current architecture of enterprise systems and the universe of blockchain technologies.\u00b7 Consensus vs. Identity\u00b7 Centralized vs. Decentralized Identity AssertionsConsensus vs. IdentityEnabling identity management capabilities in permissioned blockchain scenarios goes beyond a technical challenge creates a friction with one of the fundamental principles of decentralized layers. The biggest contribution of blockchain technologies was that, for the first time in the history of computer science, we have a model in which we can trust math and cryptography instead of centralized parties. Using that principle as a foundation, blockchain architectures evolved based on consensus protocols such as proof-of-work(PoW) or proof-of-stake(PoS) that rely on computations in order to make decisions. In that decentralized world, identity hasn\u2019t been a fundamental building block as the dynamics of the network should arrive to an optimal decision-making process.The computation-based consensus models of blockchain stacks fundamentally contrasts with the enterprise solutions in which the identities of the participants are well known. In that sense, you can argue that consensus protocols deliver very little in a world of known identities.Centralized vs. Decentralized Identity AssertionsThe current architecture of enterprise identity management systems relies on centralized gatekeepers to create assertions about user\u2019s identities. Reconciling that model with distributed ledger architectures in which the assertions will be distributed across a network of participants is far from trivial. Ideally, we need a model in which identity assertions are placed on-chain encoded in a cryptographically secured way and distributed to the relevant network entities.The Building Blocks of Decentralized Identity in Permissioned BlockchainsTo address some of the challenges listed in the previous section, there are a few technological components that we have found incredibly relevant in permissioned blockchain architectures.Proof-Of-AuthorityProof-Of-Authority(PoA) is a type of consensus mechanism that relies on identity as a first class citizens. In PoA networks, consensus is achieved by referring to a list of validators (referred to as authorities when they are linked to physical entities). Validators are a group of accounts/nodes that are allowed to participate in the consensus; they validate the transactions and blocks. PoA doesn\u2019t require solving computationally expensive puzzles to commit a transaction. Instead, a transaction simply has to be signed off by the majority of validators, in which case it becomes a part of the permanent record.When adapted to enterprise blockchain scenarios, PoA consensus is very relevant as can leverage the existing identity of users and systems instead of relying on computational puzzles. There are several implementations of PoA consensus that are relevant to permissioned blockchains including Parity\u2019s and Microsoft AzureDecentralized Identity ProtocolsThe emerging field of decentralized identities looks to leverage decades of technological progress in identity methods and standards in the new world of decentralized runtimes. To achieve that, identity needs to be reconstructed using an architecture moves a lot of the traditional identity dynamics into a decentralized network of participants.Microsoft has been one of the leaders in the identity management space for the last 20 years but even they realize that blockchain runtimes require a new identity models. Inspired by DIF, Microsoft recently proposed a forward-thinking architecture to enable decentralized identities in blockchain runtimes. The Microsoft architecture includes the following components:\u00b7 W3C Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs): IDs users create, own, and control independently of any organization or government. DIDs are globally unique identifiers linked to Decentralized Public Key Infrastructure (DPKI) metadata composed of JSON documents that contain public key material, authentication descriptors, and service endpoints.\u00b7 Decentralized systems: DIDs are rooted in decentralized systems that provide the mechanism and features required for DPKI.\u00b7 DID User Agents: Applications that enable real people to use decentralized identities. User Agent apps aid in creating DIDs, managing data and permissions, and signing/validating DID-linked claims.\u00b7 DIF Universal Resolver: A server that utilizes a collection of DID Drivers to provide a standard means of lookup and resolution for DIDs across implementations and decentralized systems and that returns the DID Document Object (DDO) that encapsulates DPKI metadata associated with a DID.\u00b7 DIF Identity Hubs: A replicated mesh of encrypted personal datastores, composed of cloud and edge instances (like mobile phones, PCs or smart speakers), that facilitate identity data storage and identity interactions.\u00b7 DID Attestations: DID-signed attestations are based on standard formats and protocols. They enable identity owners to generate, present, and verify claims. This forms the basis of trust between users of the systems.In the context of permissioned blockchain implementations, decentralized identity protocols present a clear bridge between traditional enterprise identity management systems and blockchain DApps.The Zero-Knowledge Proof Identity StoresThe concepts of attestations or claims as well as decentralized hubs are some of the most important principles of decentralized identity models. One interesting idea is to combine decentralized hubs with zero-knowledge-proofs protocols such as zk-SNARKs to add another level of privacy to the DIDs while allowing other protocols to validate identity attestations. I like to call this concept zero-knowledge identity stores and has been embraced by protocols like uPort.In the zero-knowledge identity store model, the assertions related to the user\u2019s identity will be encoded using zk-SNARKs and published on-chain. Smart contracts can validate assertions about the user\u2019s identity without revealing anything about the underlying user\u2019s identity which maintains the execution on-chain while enforcing high levels of privacy.Some Decentralized Identity Solutions you Should Know AboutThe space of decentralized identity is certainly very nascent but there are already some relevant efforts that might serve for inspiration to security token protocols. Here are some of my favorites:\u00b7 uPort: uPort has been steadily building a series of protocols and solutions for managing identities in decentralized applications. The current stack is compatible with Ethereum smart contracts and can be leveraged in permissioned blockchain applications\u00b7 Azure BaaS: The Azure team has done a remarkable job extending the core protocols of different blockchain to leverage Azure Active Directory identities. A recent example of this work was the implementation of the proof-of-authority consensus protocol in Ethereum applications.\u00b7 Sidetree: It is a composition of code-level components that include deterministic processing logic, a content addressable storage abstraction, and state validation procedures that can be deployed atop Layer 1 decentralized ledger systems (e.g. public blockchains) to produce permissionless, Layer 2 DID networks.\u00b7 Hyperledger Indy: If you live in Hyperledger land, Indy offers one of the most complete stacks to enable identity management capabilities. The current version of Indy includes tools and libraries that implement some of the most common patterns in decentralized identity solutions.Identity is one of the fundamental building blocks of permissioned blockchain applications and one that needs to be addressed in order to enable the mainstream adoption of these technologies. Efforts such as the decentralized identity foundation(DIF) are leading the way to bridge the gap between traditional identity systems and the new world of blockchains. Although there are some protocols and tools in the space, enabling identity capabilities in enterprise blockchain solutions is still a fairly complex endeavor.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Ethereum", "Cryptocurrency", "Hyperledger", "Invector Labs"]}, {"title": "Ethereum Wallet: Gi\u1ea3i M\u00e3 File UTC JSON", "post_link": "https://medium.com/vischub/ethereum-wallet-gi%E1%BA%A3i-m%C3%A3-file-utc-json-dc62a5c2ce53?source=search_post", "author_name": "LE QUOC VIET", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@vietlq", "publish_date": "2017-10-14", "last_modified_date": "2018-04-29", "readtime": "4.56", "claps": 22, "voters": 16, "content": "Ethereum Wallet: Gi\u1ea3i M\u00e3 File UTC JSONLE QUOC VIETFollowOct 14, 2017 \u00b7 5 min readKhi t\u1ea1o v\u00ed Ethereum b\u1eb1ng Geth, Parity, Web3.js, hay trang MyEtherWallet (MEW), b\u1ea1n ph\u1ea3i cung c\u1eadp m\u1eadt kh\u1ea9u s\u1ebd nh\u1eadn \u0111\u01b0\u1ee3c file UTC c\u00f3 \u0111\u1ecbnh d\u1ea1ng JSON.

I had a chance to tinker with Ethers.js recently and was impressed with it. In this post/tutorial, I show how you can use Ethers.js to build a simple dapp. I hope this helps you evaluate and get started using Ethers.js for your next project.In this tutorial, we will create a simple Voting dapp (very similar to our popular \u2018Hello world voting dapp\u2019 many of you might know!). The Solidity contract will be the same but we will use Ethers.js instead of Web3.js for the frontend. The application is extremely simple, all it does is initialize a set of candidates, let anyone vote for those candidates and display the total votes received by each candidate.If you are new to Ethereum, here are some courses that can help you get started.The goal of this tutorial is to:1. Set up the development environment2. Learn the process of writing a contract, compiling it and deploying it in your development environment3. Interact with the contract using ethers.js through a nodejs console4. Interact with the contract using ethers.js in a simple web page to display the vote counts and vote for candidates through the pageIf you have already worked through the \u2018Hello world voting dapp\u2019, you can skip to Step 3.This is how I would visualize this application we are going to build.1. Setting up the development environmentInstead of developing the app against the live blockchain, we will use an in- memory blockchain (think of it as a blockchain simulator) called ganache. Below are the steps to install ganache, ethersjs, solc (to compile our contract) and start the test blockchain on a macos. The exact same instructions work on linux as well.zastrin@macbook$ brew updatezastrin@macbook$ brew install nodejszastrin@macbook$ mkdir -p ethereum_voting_dapp/chapter1-ethersjszastrin@macbook$ cd ethereum_voting_dapp/chapter1-ethersjszastrin@macbook$ npm install ganache-cli ethers solc@0.5.3zastrin@macbook$ node_modules/.bin/ganache-cliGanache CLI v6.0.3 (ganache-core: 2.0.2)Available Accounts==================(0) 0x5c252a0c0475f9711b56ab160a1999729eccce97(1) 0x353d310bed379b2d1df3b727645e200997016ba3(2) 0xa3ddc09b5e49d654a43e161cae3f865261cabd23(3) 0xa8a188c6d97ec8cf905cc1dd1cd318e887249ec5(4) 0xc0aa5f8b79db71335dacc7cd116f357d7ecd2798(5) 0xda695959ff85f0581ca924e549567390a0034058(6) 0xd4ee63452555a87048dcfe2a039208d113323790(7) 0xc60c8a7b752d38e35e0359e25a2e0f6692b10d14(8) 0xba7ec95286334e8634e89760fab8d2ec1226bf42(9) 0x208e02303fe29be3698732e92ca32b88d80a2d36Private Keys==================(0) a6de9563d3db157ed9926a993559dc177be74a23fd88ff5776ff0505d21fed2b(1) 17f71d31360fbafbc90cad906723430e9694daed3c24e1e9e186b4e3ccf4d603(2) ad2b90ce116945c11eaf081f60976d5d1d52f721e659887fcebce5c81ee6ce99(3) 68e2288df55cbc3a13a2953508c8e0457e1e71cd8ae62f0c78c3a5c929f35430(4) 9753b05bd606e2ffc65a190420524f2efc8b16edb8489e734a607f589f0b67a8(5) 6e8e8c468cf75fd4de0406a1a32819036b9fa64163e8be5bb6f7914ac71251cc(6) c287c82e2040d271b9a4e071190715d40c0b861eb248d5a671874f3ca6d978a9(7) cec41ef9ccf6cb3007c759bf3fce8ca485239af1092065aa52b703fd04803c9d(8) c890580206f0bbea67542246d09ab4bef7eeaa22c3448dcb7253ac2414a5362a(9) eb8841a5ae34ff3f4248586e73fcb274a7f5dd2dc07b352d2c4b71132b3c73fHD Wallet==================Mnemonic: cancel better shock lady capable main crunch alcohol derive alarm duck umbrellaBase HD Path: m/44'/60'/0'/0/{account_index}Listening on localhost:8545Notice that the ganache-cli creates 10 test accounts to play with automatically. These accounts come preloaded with 100 (fake) ethers.2. Simple voting contractWe are going to use the solidity programming language to write our contract. If you are familiar with object oriented programming, learning to write solidity contracts should be a breeze. We will write a contract (think of contract as a class in your favorite OOP language) called Voting with a constructor which initializes an array of candidates. We will write 2 methods, one to return the total votes a candidate has received and another method to increment vote count for a candidate.Note: The constructor is invoked once and only once when you deploy the contract to the blockchain. Unlike in the web world where every deploy of your code overwrites the old code, deployed code in the blockchain is immutable. i.e, If you update your contract and deploy again, the old contract will still be in the blockchain untouched along with all the data stored in it, the new deployment will create a new instance of the contract.Below is the voting contract code with inline comment explanation:Copy the above code to a file named Voting.sol in the ethereum_voting_dapp/chapter1-ethersjs directory. Now let\u2019s compile the code and deploy it to ganache blockchain. Follow the commands below to compile the contract.zastrin@macbook$ node_modules/.bin/solcjs \u2014 bin \u2014 abi Voting.solzastrin@macbook$ lsVoting.sol Voting_sol_Voting.abi Voting_sol_Voting.binWhen you compile the code successfully using the command above, the compiler outputs 2 files that are important to understand:1. Voting_sol_Voting.bin: This is the bytecode you get when the source code in Voting.sol is compiled. This is the code which will be deployed to the blockchain.2. Voting_sol_Voting.abi: This is an interface or template of the contract (called abi) which tells the contract user what methods are available in the contract. Whenever you have to interact with the contract in the future, you will need this abi definition. You can read more details about ABI hereWe will now use ethersjs library to deploy our application and interact with it.First, run the \u2018node\u2019 command in your terminal to get in to the node console and initialize the ethers object. All the code snippets below need to be typed in the node console. To compile the contract, load the bytecode and abi from the file system in to a string like shown belowzastrin@macbook$ node> ethers = require(\u2018ethers\u2019)> bytecode = fs.readFileSync(\u2018Voting_sol_Voting.bin\u2019).toString()> abi = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(\u2018Voting_sol_Voting.abi\u2019).toString())Next is to initialize the provider which is a generic interface to connect to the blockchain. Since we are running the blockchain locally, we will use the JsonRPCProvider to connect to it. If you wanted to connect to a real blockchain, you have many other provider options. Once connected, you can test the connection by querying ganache and listing all the accounts. Running the below commands in your nodejs console should list 10 accounts.> provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider()> provider.listAccounts().then(result => console.log(result))The next step is to initialize the signer which is used to sign the transactions. We can select which account we want to use (we have 10 accounts ganache in setup) by passing the index to getSigner as shown below. Once the wallet is intialized, create a contract factory and deploy the contract as shown. The deploy function takes an array of arguments that is passed to the constructor of the contract. In our case, we pass in the names of the candidates. We have to explicitly convert string to bytes32 because our contract takes bytes32 as argument.> signer = provider.getSigner(0)> factory = new ethers.ContractFactory(abi, bytecode, signer)> contract = null> factory.deploy([ethers.utils.formatBytes32String(\u2018Rama\u2019), ethers.utils.formatBytes32String(\u2018Nick\u2019), ethers.utils.formatBytes32String(\u2018Jose\u2019)]).then(\u00a9 => { contract = c})If you successfully deployed the contract, your contract object should have all the details of the deployed contract. There are hundreds of thousands of contracts deployed on the blockchain. So, how do you identify your contract in that blockchain? Answer: contract.address. When you have to interact with your contract, you need this deployed address and abi definition we talked about earlier.3. Interact with the contract in the nodejs console> contract.totalVotesFor(ethers.utils.formatBytes32String(\u2018Rama\u2019)).then((f) => console.log(f.toNumber()))> contract.voteForCandidate(ethers.utils.formatBytes32String(\u2018Rama\u2019)).then((f) => console.log(f))> contract.totalVotesFor(ethers.utils.formatBytes32String(\u2018Rama\u2019)).then((f) => console.log(f.toNumber()))Try the above commands in your node console and you should see the vote count increment. Every time you vote for a candidate, you get back a transaction id: Example: \u20180xdedc7ae544c3dde74ab5a0b07422c5a51b5240603d31074f5b75c0ebc786bf53\u2019 above). This transaction id is the proof that this transaction occurred and you can refer back to this at any time in the future. This transaction is immutable. This immutability is one of the big advantages of blockchains such as Ethereum.4. Webpage to connect to the blockchain and voteNow that most of the work is done, all we have to do now is create a simple html file with candidate names and invoke the voting commands (which we already tried and tested in the nodejs console) in a js file. Below you can find the html code and the js file. Drop both of them in the ethereum_voting_dapp/chapter1-ethersjs directory and open the index.html in your browser.You should now see the vote counts and you should also be able to vote for candidates.If you are using a wallet like Metamask, you will need to use a Web3 provider instead of JsonRPCProvider we used earlier. To do that, simply change the provider in your index.js to:provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(web3.currentProvider);If you want to interact through Metamask, you can\u2019t just open index.html and interact in your browser anymore. You have to server the file through a server. So, install a simple webserver and start like belowzastrin@macbook$ npm install http-serverzastrin@macbook$ http-serverYou can now go to localhost:8080 and interact with your application. Below is a quick demo which includes loading test ether account into metamask.I hope you were able to follow along and get the application working.If you run into issues getting the application working, feel free to DM me on twitter @zastrinlab or email mahesh@zastrin.com.Thanks to Richard for the feedback.If you liked this tutorial, check out more interesting real-world project based courses", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Dapps"]}, {"title": "Microsoft and Gitcoin Team Up to Turn the Traditional Hackathon Model Upside Down", "post_link": "https://media.consensys.net/microsoft-and-gitcoin-team-up-to-turn-the-traditional-hackathon-model-upside-down-19fdeb531b89?source=search_post", "author_name": "ConsenSys", "author_link": "https://media.consensys.net/@ConsenSys", "publish_date": "2019-04-16", "last_modified_date": "2019-04-27", "readtime": "2.68", "claps": 92, "voters": 17, "content": "Microsoft and Gitcoin Team Up to Turn the Traditional Hackathon Model Upside DownFor the next 2 weeks, the Ethereal Virtual Hackathon is bountying challenges and rewarding Web3 developers in ETHConsenSysFollowApr 16 \u00b7 3 min readConsenSys Labs is on a mission to rethink hackathons.Yesterday, we launched two challenges as part of the Ethereal Virtual Hackathon. Both are focused on upending the orthodoxes of finance and banking. Both hope to find new opportunities through Decentralized Finance, and both are part of a bigger quest to find new ways to incentivize hackers to not just exercise their code muscles, but also their entrepreneurial instincts.We think, with a more flexible structure and new expectations, the hackathon model can be rethought to create not just interesting tech and product builds, but strong signals from ideas and people worth investing in.So we\u2019re piloting something new. We call it Nights & Weekends.\u201cWe think tomorrow\u2019s big breakthroughs will come from the nights and weekends of top software engineers today.\u201d\u2013Kevin Owocki, Founder / Chief Janitor of GitcoinSo what is it?A remote-first buildathon for hackers and entrepreneurs.We\u2019ve always believed the competitive advantage of building a decentralized company comes from creating greater access outside of the typical concentrations. So we\u2019re focusing on building a remote, and virtual, system to make sure people with the ambition to make something can participate, wherever they are.Longer duration for better signals.We think the point of early products are signals. Traditional hackathons tend to run in a couple short days or evenings, and the most you can get to is a quick build or a quick pitch. We want to see what happens when you give participants the time and expectation of finding real experts, real communities with the problems they\u2019re trying to solve, and getting real feedback.Our pilot will last 15 days, but we\u2019ll explore longer cycles, with the intention of giving hackers the space to not just build, but test and validate the market.A program of support and collaboration.Finally, Consensys Labs will be running daily office hours, open to all participants, to help them move forward, and connect to the right people at the right times. We think a hackathon can be part sprint, part jam session, and part accelerator. At each stage, the Labs team will be available to support everything from idea generation to expert interviews, design, research, and growth. We think creating more collisions between people and expertise will create better outcomes for all.The Ethereal Hackathon has already kicked off, but it\u2019s not too late to get started. It runs from April 15th to April 30th, just ahead of the Ethereal Summit on May 10\u201311. Hackathon winners will be invited to join us in New York to present their winning work live in front of 600+ guests interested in building the future of the internet.If you\u2019re somebody who can\u2019t help but build, and wants to find new solutions to old orthodoxies through Web3, we\u2019d love to meet you.

The audit found 0 Critical, 0 High, 2 Medium and 9 Low level issues, all of which have been resolved in the latest commits to the code.The Polkadot Claims contract is an Ethereum smart contract allows holders of the DOT allocation indicator token to claim their balances of DOTs to a Polkadot public key ahead of Polkadot genesis.In order to launch Polkadot in a transparent and decentralized way, an Ethereum smart contract was required to hold data necessary to the genesis of Polkadot including the Polkadot public key to associate to a specific allocation, the index of the public key, and the vested status of the allocation.Submission of this data to the Ethereum blockchain enables the community to generate and verify the genesis chain specification themselves in an independent manner. It is an integral piece to the launch of Polkadot in a transparent way.For this reason, the security of the contract was of the utmost importance, especially regarding the certain immutability of the state of the contract after claiming actions have taken place.To guarantee that the Claims contract is secure and functionally correct, Chain Security formally verified the contract\u2019s code with respect to its intended specification. In more detail, Chain Security formalized 12 critical functional requirements and verified them using their state-of-the-art tool for formal verification. Examples of the properties that were verified include the immutability of the state after the initialization, access-control requirements, and safety of the contract set-up period.In addition to the formal verification, the full audit report details each of the issues that were found in the categories of Security Issues, Trust Issues, and Design Issues.

The world needs a new way to serve static web pages!\u201dThat\u2019s exactly what we said. No\u2026not really.What we really said is that it would be cool to try building a service that uses Ethereum smart contracts and ENS to translate human-readable stuff you type into a browser into IPFS locations (hashes), go pull the data at those locations, and serve it back up \u2014 hey, Presto \u2014 into the user\u2019s browser.And we also said it would be especially cool if we did this in a way that could help our sad and lonely devops guru, Michael, with stuff like A-B testing by using the service to apply rules via smart contract to that translation.

So as long as the person who wrote the page wasn\u2019t Dr. Evil, you\u2019re good.

With Soy, you can deploy new versions all the time, and keeping every version available and reference-able makes caches easier to manage.The pattern also makes it straightforward to do things like time traveling: what did the site look like at a specific date or what will it look like in the future?Community CallIt\u2019s not like we\u2019re the only ones to ever make an IPFS/ENS \u201cwebserver\u201d. Eth.show, Metamask, and a bunch of other chrome extensions do it just fine. What we provide on the Web3Studio Github Repo is one way \u2014 albeit a super awesomely nice, totally open source way that works for IPFS rather than Swarm \u2014 of not having to use an extension for the purpose.The whole reason for our team is to provide open source (Apache2) code, designs, and stories to help more people make more things. So, we set up the Github repository as a way to say, \u201cFork Me!\u201d [Um\u2026that doesn\u2019t sound right\u2026maybe something more welcoming? How about: \u201cJoin our merry band of contributors and maintainers! #meritocracy.\u201d]What\u2019s in the Box?Soy consists of 3 parts:An ENS resolver. Think of this like DNS, but it\u2019s Turing complete because it\u2019s a smart contract. The record resolves to a contenthash (an IPFS location) given a set of inputs, the name (obviously) as well as any other variables programmed into the contract or any other input provided by Ethereum like the date, block-height, or \"randomness\". This gives us the ability to do things like blue/green deploys, a/b testing, slow rollouts, time-traveling, and dark launches.A node library to interact with the contract. Web3js is still a pain, unit conversion is a pain, writing scripts that you copy everywhere is a drag. Common actions are put here and are easily run in CI/CD environments.A gateway. This is a shim until browsers support distributed file systems natively. The gateway rewrites requests from the browser to a specific content hash.What Soy Isn\u2019t Good AtAt least for now, the Soy pattern is a choice against some essential features needed by many sites:Can\u2019t handle dynamically rendered pages. Soy can let you create routing logic via a custom smart contract, but if you need to do more than route between different static pages, Soy won\u2019t work for that. (Until you chip in and help us figure out to do it!)Can\u2019t handle private content. Because the pages Soy serves up are on IPFS, it\u2019s all out there for anyone in the public to query.Can\u2019t really handle forms, though you are probably using an api server for that anyway.The Near FutureWhether it\u2019s Soy or some other variant of the pattern, sooner or later the unstoppable web is going to be a thing. Edge computing is coming. Cloud, mobile and broadband companies are getting into the act.Your content is coming to a device near you.Or we should say, to many devices near you\u2026the more you and people near you call up the same content.Distribution allows devs to focus on the content and the user rather than their infrastructure. Setting up a global cache, CDN, and web server in today\u2019s world is a pain. It can take a while, and it can fail in complex ways. Using the Ethereum world computer for what it\u2019s good for keeps you focused on more important things.In the world of the near future, there are IPFS nodes everywhere. They\u2019re in everyone\u2019s browser, they\u2019re run by ISPs next to large population centers, and they\u2019re run in every home router. As content gets accessed it stays and moves closer and closer to users. When content is requested, it moves from peer to peer, always keeping users next to their content. Distribution is easy because everything is hash addressable. Updating it is as easy as updating a contract. After that, the world computer handles propagation.We now have a world where we don\u2019t copy the same jquery file on thousands of origin servers. The content lives where people are using it.Big Things Start SmallThe more of us that use and contribute to patterns like Soy, the faster and smarter our friends building browsers and managing internet standards will be in supporting it and making it easy for users to find and access content on the unstoppable web.So, hop on the GitHub Repo.

Smaller entities follow the path of the larger technology companies, using similar methods of operation. In this way, the current internet could be described as centralized.The Problem with CentralizationA few companies control most of the action on the internet, and they are known as the FAANGs (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google, with other companies like Microsoft and Twitter rounding out the oligopoly). Together, they effectively control the internet. This can be seen in two related areas: data privacy and control of information.We share billions of pieces of personal data daily online and the vast majority are stored in giant servers owned by the FAANGs and located in just a few places across the globe. This data is valuable to advertisers and market researchers, as well as less credible actors, who can gain access to it and influence our lives. There are just a few large platforms that drive most internet traffic to online news sources. These platforms have enormous influence over what sources of information we consume on a daily basis. Centralized data storage and control is also vulnerable to direct attacks, such as hacking.What is a Decentralized Web?A move from centralization to decentralization would be a significant change in how information is stored and shared online. A decentralized internet would not use centralized servers. Instead, it would rely on a network of many computers and widely distributing data. Each computer acts as a \u201cnode,\u201d contributing power and memory to a distributed storage network system. The data is not stored in any one privately-owned silos. Thus, there is no central point to hack and no way for an oligarchy of entities to take control of it.This model of a peer-to-peer infrastructure of nodes is used by a blockchain\u2019s distributed ledger and is why blockchain could be the solution to the challenge of how to create a decentralized web.Could Blockchain Power a Decentralized Web?On blockchain networks, data storage is shared across the nodes in the blockchain. The blockchain includes a ledger of transactions and smart contracts that can be executed automatically when certain conditions are met. Though not essential in this use case, a blockchain network also usually has a native coin or token that helps to verify transactions and data onto the chain and afford voting or governance rights to network participants. This technology is appealing because, in theory, it is less corruptible and more resistant to corporate or political regulation.Exploring AlternativesInternet creator Berners-Lee has been working on a solution to the problems with today\u2019s centralized internet. He has created the \u201cSolid\u201d platform, which uses existing web protocols but allows users to control their own data and store it in a single \u201cdata pod\u201d that can be used to integrate with various applications or platforms.For example, a user moving from a web search engine to a social media platform would use their single, self-stored Solid data pod to verify transactions within each application. In each case, the user would only reveal the data they need to perform the activity they were pursuing (e.g. posting to social media or making an online purchase).Blockchain-Based Decentralized Web on the Horizon?Blockchain technology faces challenges that could impact its use as a foundational technology for the internet. Currently, different blockchains struggle to communicate with each other and share data. This functionality is known as \u201cinteroperability,\u201d which is necessary for the technology to move forward. Currently, no single blockchain is powerful enough or independent enough to be a base for the entire internet. If blockchains solve the problem of interoperability then many difference chains could be interconnected and pose a solution viable for Web3.However, scalability is also an issue. Even the most advanced blockchains, like Ethereum, can only process a limited number of transactions per second. Ethereum can process 10\u201315 transactions per second. Until this processes capacity is vastly increased it won\u2019t be possible for any blockchain network to gain widespread adoption.Each search engine query or social media post would create a blockchain transaction. Widespread adoption would multiply the number of blockchain-based transactions exponentially. In this sense, blockchain has a ways to go before it could realistically power the web.Mina Down - Hacker NoonRead writing from Mina Down in Hacker Noon.

What\u2019s essential? What\u2019s the priority? What can we live without, and what will bog us down and confuse our users if we try to keep it in?I know this. I know that products can\u2019t be all things to all users. I make products. But it doesn\u2019t stop me from constantly signing up for app subscriptions and then dumping them for lack of something I need\u2026or just really want.Todoist \u2014 An Awesome App Begging to be ModifiedI use a wonderful task list app called Todoist. I use it, because it\u2019s the only task manager I\u2019ve found that allows me (sort-of) to put tasks that take time to complete directly on to my Google calendar.Most task lists, including Google Tasks, will at-most show tasks in the \u201call day\u201d section of a calendar. They are, from a data perspective, in a completely separate world to the events that let you block time out in your day to do a meeting or\u2026to get things done.That\u2019s why I use Todoist, because it lets me quickly set up tasks, nest them below each other and set up projects to contain them. And it lets me not only drop the tasks on my work calendar but 2\u2013way sync them, so that if I move an entry in my calendar, the change is reflected in Todoist\u2026and vice versa.Todoist is great. But it\u2019s missing one thing that drives me crazy. While each task has a start time, there is no end time\u2026because there is no field in a Todoist task to contain that value. And that means you have to set a default duration for all Todoist tasks in order for them to sync to Google calendar, which does require an end-time in order to place something on the events display.So even though you can change the duration of a Todoist task once it\u2019s on the calendar, that change isn\u2019t reflected in Todoist, because there is no place to put the new ending time.This also limits the app\u2019s ability to add other useful features, like project planning or time-based dependencies, where a task doesn\u2019t get on the calendar until the task it depends on is complete.And Then Came ModicumBefore Modicum, my recourse for this was to tweet, post Reddit entries, and sometimes go directly to the company to plead for them to prioritize what I wanted. This usually resulted in a representative replying with, \u201cThis is a great idea, and our team will add it to our backlog.\u201d A year later, same answer\u2026even if a cacophony of others had joined in, practically petitioning for the feature.You can\u2019t blame the product team.Once a product launches \u2014 and usually long beforehand --the team is beset by a crushing load of technical debt, quality issues, bugs, and unfilled features that were promised from the get-go.It\u2019s rare in my experience to see a team get out from under that and focus on new features or attributes like that end-time field, which I\u2019m obsessing about.But now, not only do I not have to wait around for Todoist to add the damn field, I can make real money adding it myself.Todoist is part of the Modicum movement. So I can register with Modicum, get the Todoist code, and make my changes.Meh, you say: \u201cThat\u2019s just open source.\u201d But behold! This isn\u2019t just open source. I mean, sure, yeah\u2026it\u2019s open source, but with special sauce. Read on!First, Todoist would never reveal it\u2019s source code under normal conditions. Not everything should be open sourced. They worked hard on this app, and they don\u2019t want to make it easy for competitors to appropriate their best work. And look \u2014 I\u2019m an open source acolyte from 90\u2019s era, but even I don\u2019t think everything is right for unfettered open source.Modicum gets me access to the Todoist codebase by tracking my reputation and insuring Todoist against me appropriating their work. I pay a small $35 fee, which I assume covers this. And I sign an OpenLaw agreement that stipulates \u201cmod-only\u201d terms.Using the Modicum Chrome plugin for GitHub, I fork the Todoist repo, make my mods, and then hit the deploy button.This is where the magic happens. There is now a running Todoist mod running on Microsoft Azure. And thanks to that OpenLaw Smart Agreement (and a little blockchain magic) I am now a Franchisor of Todoist\u2026level 1.Level 1 means two things:I don\u2019t have many users yet;Todoist is not yet sanctioning my mod as \u201cCanon\u201d --meaning they are tolerating my mod\u2019s existence and playing wait-and-see.I go up levels as I get users, my mod proves it isn\u2019t a nest of bugs, and the Todoist team gives me \u201cmerit badges\u201d for higher levels. The higher the level, the more money I get.In my mod, I added that end-time field. And then I added some UI components and modified a few of the workflows, so that a user can set the duration of their task. And that\u2019s it. The task is on the calendar, set to the exact block of time I want to carve out of my day to work on it.While I was making these mods, I found a few problems with the Todoist code, which I fixed and submitted as pull requests to the main Todoist branch. Free work for them, but it will benefit me.Todoist likes Modicum and has a healthy attitude about these mods, so they put a section right on their site that lists all the different mods, with a big giant \u201cuse at your own risk\u201d sign, of course. It\u2019s like if a beta program had a baby with an app store.If a user buys my mod of Todoist, they pay a 10% premium. I get that fee. (Todoist shares some of their fee to Modicum to run the mod program.) If they wind up not liking my mod, they can go back to using the core Todoist at no extra charge. Todoist uses Modicum to keep track of which features are being modded and which are gaining popularity.If my mod, for example, gets popular enough, not only will I be making money but I run the chance of getting absorbed into the Todoist main app. If that happens, they pay me 10x the amount I had collected until that time\u2026with a minimum threshold of $20,000!Modding ModsHere\u2019s the funny thing. After my mod was out there for a couple months, I got modded. Someone else was annoyed that my version didn\u2019t have an easy way to chop up a task into a series of different time blocks. So they added that feature. And it\u2019s gratifying to me that they didn\u2019t choose to mod off the main branch. If my modifications weren\u2019t of high quality, or if they were too easy to just re-implement off the main branch, then there would be nothing stopping someone from circumventing my branch.So now, I\u2019m not only getting money when someone selects my branch, but I\u2019m also getting 20% of the take from this second mod. Pretty good. Gives me an incentive to make my mod really easy for others to mod.What\u2019s Modicum doing in all this?Aside from making the Github Chrome plugin that permissions access to the code repository and makes deployment a one-click affair, Modicum does a lot of the grunt work of ensuring nobody games the system and ensuring everyone gets paid properly.Todoist doesn\u2019t want to have to deal with managing all these different runtimes or with managing the marketplace of all the mods. It can get confusing. Modicum makes all that turnkey for them.Modicum also maintains the chart of accounts that allows the developer and the modders to keep straight who gets what percentages from user fees, especially when these are subscription-based. Modicum uses a blockchain SRNFT smart contract integrated via OpenLaw into both Azure and a subscription payments platform for that. Each mod has a release. Each release has a checksum. This checksum is published and tracked in an Openlaw contract, and each payment linked to it is tracked.Modicum also provides services to watch for rule breakers\u2026folks who used the code without permission.What I Wish Modicum DidI think Modicum is a great step forward. But it still could go further in making modding easier. And maybe it will. (Or maybe someone will Mod Modicum!) It took me three days of pretty focused effort figuring out the Todoist code. Their docs sucked. Maybe Modicum should offer \u201cdoc-unsuckage\u201d as a service for a few more points of revenue.Do I Think Modicum Will Survive and Thrive?It\u2019s early, but because Modicum integrates so well with Github and Azure to make one-click runtime deployment easy, they seem to already have more than a few titles on their catalog. A few of these have nice mods. I did see a couple terrible mods, too. I figure the big thing to watch for isn\u2019t the number of titles but the number of high-quality mods and whether those drive either revenue or accelerate the speed to market for product improvements and new features people want.The App Multiverse?In the era of the Marvel Cinematic Universe\u2019s Phase IV, featuring the \u201cmultiverse\u201d \u2014 watch Spider-Man Into the Spider-Verse and you\u2019ll understand \u2014 Modicum seems right with the times.It\u2019s a coordinated multiverse of options, making modders into franchisers, growing the market for the original makers, giving a wider set of user-tested options to merge into the main app when they work out, and giving the modders a chance to tap into demand for a mature title like Todoist without having to build distribution for themselves on a totally different codebase that otherwise would have to compete with the product that inspired them.We hope you enjoyed this story from ConsenSys Web3Studio.

BlockParty has your back.KickbackEvent no shows? No problem. Kickback reduces no shows by asking registrants to put some skin in the game.kickback.eventsThe dilemma of free events.The upcoming Berlin blockchain week during ETHBerlin is already packed with many eventsLike last year\u2019s DevCon3 and upcoming Berlin BlockChain week, we expect that many companies are going to plan events in Prague during DevCon4.And as an event organiser, you will face some dilemma. If you let anyone come, your event may get overcrowded or run out of food and drink, making everybody unhappy. But, if you try to strictly manage using traditional ticketing system like meetup.com or eventbrite, people try to get spots regardless of their intention to come, or not. Your event may become full very quickly but you (and your sponsor) may face the disappointment on the day of the event with low turn out and wasted food. The most pragmatic approach is to charge a small fee ($5~10), but you may lose out to other events which offer free events. Also offering free events really shows off your support to its community members.But we have some good news: BlockParty is your solution to all of these problems! So if you\u2019re planning an event around DevCon4, or any other upcoming blockchain-related events, we want to hear from you!The upcoming Berlin blockchain week during ETHBerlin is already packed with many eventsDuring DevCon3, we provided a social event calendarWhat BlockParty can offerFor those of you who are not familiar, BlockParty is an Ethereum-based event management smart contract. It\u2019s very simple: you pay a small deposit when you RSVP, and you lose your deposit if you don\u2019t turn up. If you do show up, you get your deposit back + we split the deposit of those who did not turn up. You go to a party and may end up getting more money!We have used BlockParty at DevCon2 (Shanghai), DevCon3 (Shanghai), EDCON 2017, and Ethcc conf (both in Paris) as well as at my local meetups (London Ethereum Codeup, piloting at Ethereum London), and at ENS Hackathon. Also back in June, Josef Jelacic bravely deployed the smart contract and gave away some free spots using BlockParty all by himself.Using BlockParty, the average no-show rate drops down to around 10%, as opposed to the 50% we see at most free events (see this article for more detail).In addition to preventing no shows, BlockParty brings a bit of excitement in terms of finding out who actually didn\u2019t turn up. In traditional events, turning up to empty events is not cool, and a disappointment to participants, but it is welcomed with BlockParty. We jokingly often say that \u201cunfortunately, everybody turned up!\u201dBlockParty x Status IncubateUntil recently, I was a bit wary of opening up BlockParty to other events, as BlockParty was more of a proof of concept only maintained and ran by me.With the recent announcement of BlockParty being backed by Status Incubate, we finally have a chance to do it properly. We will be working hard to make the Dapp scalable to be able to host multiple events.We will be looking for several other (brave) meetups to host free events using this bleeding edge BlockParty prior to/during DevCon4.By hosting your meetup on BlockParty, you (and your participants) will have a chance to experience the future of free events based on Cryptoeconomics, and thus stand out from the crowded DevCon4 event space.How much is the gas cost?In terms of gas cost (which you pay to Etherem miners), it depends on the gas price.In the lucky scenario of gas price being 1~5gwei, it will cost around 1~5 USD to deploy the smart contract (show below as create ). The marking attendees (shown below as batchAttend) linearly increases depending on the number of participants.As a participant, you need to call register and withdraw which will cost a few cents each.

Her grandmother lost everything to a shady blockchain investment scheme (an ICO that had a fancy whitepaper with plenty of vague, inspiring language but a team with zero intention of doing anything but taking peoples\u2019 money). And it happened while Emma was working for a major crypto investment fund.Emma struggled with guilt after listening to Grandma say, \u201cBut honey, you were doing so well with the blockchain, and I just wanted to be part of that. Your grandfather spent his whole life being too conservative.\u201dGrandma was right. She should be allowed to be part of things. Why did the largest upside potential of innovative new ventures have to fall solely to rich \u201caccredited investors?\u201dEmma had the answer to that. It was because accredited investors could afford to research early-stage deals, and they could afford to lose 100% of their investment. But even so, Grandma had room in her budget to risk something, just not everything.Crowdfunding\u2019s Promise and ProblemsEmma remembered that in May of 2016, the SEC had finally provided the rules for the 2012 JOBS Act and Title III Crowdfunding. On the surface, Title III seemed to do exactly what Emma was thinking. It let startups sell shares to non-accredited investors, any US citizen worth less than one million dollars or making less than two-or-three hundred thousand a year.But in 2018, Title III wasn\u2019t being used very much. Maybe one-hundred million raised, which could mean as few as 100 startups all-up. The reason was in the fine print of the regulation:Startups couldn\u2019t raise more than $1 million dollars from crowdfunding, and in order to offer shares, a startup had to engage costly legal services and auditing firms to validate their books \u2014 which would eat up a lot of that paltry $1 million;There were strict rules about how much someone could invest in crowdfunding opportunities in a given year, and there was no easy way to know whether someone had already exceeded their limit when they invested in something new;Crowdfunding could only be managed through broker-dealers or accredited funding portals, a new type of SEC-regulated financial intermediary. And these took on the risk of non-compliance if Grandma went over her annual limit or something went wrong\u2026so they took hefty fees of 3\u20136%, further increasing the cost and friction of raising funds this way;While it was possible to have more than 500 investors in a crowdfunding sale, it was tricky and costly to do so, which meant that to raise a million dollars, each investor had to be in for an average of $2,000. That was pretty close to the maximum amount a person with a net worth of $107,000 could invest in an entire year. And yet, a couple-thousand wasn\u2019t exactly penny cash for Grandma to invest in a single risky startup.Wouldn\u2019t it be awesome, Emma thought, if equity crowdfunding were so friction-less and safe that Grandma could invest in startups as easily and often as buying a lottery ticket?So Emma created ICGoUsing her experience and connections in blockchain finance and her background in securities law \u2014 with a little help from her friends at OpenLaw \u2014 Emma created a special kind of funding portal. ICGo now offers Title III crowdfunding and brings startups and investors together, like any other accredited funding portal. But it uses Web3 technology and practices to vastly reduce the frictions and costs.Here\u2019s how it worksStartups use the ICGo site to list their offering, but included in the portal is an automated system that takes the effort of financial and legal compliance off the back of the resource-strapped startup. At first, ICGo just ate the cost of engaging accounting and legal services, but now it has turned that into a low-friction marketplace where firms and qualified individuals bid to review deals and earn tokens for validating each others\u2019 work. ICGo also uses AI technology to further ensure that irregularities are spotted quickly. Signals from the AI are sent to the ICGo validation marketplace for verification, and that is fed back into the AI as training data. ICGo gets smarter every day, and the SEC has begun to notice. Recently they issued a positive statement about easing Title III restrictions based on ICGo\u2019s data, which shows that investor risk is much reduced from initial estimates.On the investor side \u2014 Grandma uses the ICGo app on her mobile phone to review the market of validated deals and make one-click investments. She can purchase as little as $10 worth of a given company\u2019s equity.At first Grandma could only invest about 1/2 of the total amount allowable by Title III rules for her stated net worth. But the level increased as she connected ICGo to additional sources of financial and identity validation \u2014 her bank, for starters, but things got really easy when Grandma got a self-sovereign identity vault in 2022 and connected it to the IRS. As Emma puts it:ICGo is like having TSA pre-check for venture investing.ICGo doesn\u2019t just rely on this, though. \u201cBad Grandma\u201d could be sneaky and find ways of overstating her income, over-buying by using separate funding portals, or she could just make mistakes in her taxes. Those mistakes could cost ICGo dearly if an audit found they were selling Grandma more securities than Title III allowed.ICGo Leads StandardsEmma realized as early as 2019 that to make ICGo work financially and safely, she needed to work with the SEC. Together with a team of industry and regulatory experts, she helped establish two key standards in 2021:The creation of a blockchain-based investor registry, sanctioned by the SEC. It tracks the issuance of securities to all non-accredited investors engaging in crowdfunding. Funding portals today must integrate with the registry in order to operate legally. This reduces the chance of Grandma using multiple, separate portals to invest more than her annual maximum. (The blockchain registry only returns a true/false flag to a portal when Grandma tries to invest. If false, the registry is essentially saying she has maxed-out and can\u2019t buy any more Title III securities. This acts as a black box, providing accountability but preventing information about the internal activities of the different Portals leaking to the public or to each other.)ERC 2021 is now the official crypto-token standard on Ethereum for Title III securities. The magic of 2021 is that a token complying with this ERC is incapable of completing a sale unless all of the digitally-enforceable SEC rules for Title III are met. For example, an ERC 2021 transaction will fail automatically unless the Title III registry returns \u201cTrue,\u201d indicating that Grandma has not exceeded her maximum investment limit \u2014 no matter how many portals she may have used. (If she uses a portal that isn\u2019t integrated with the registry, she \u2014 and that portal \u2014 are breaking the law.)Turning Standards Leadership into Great ToolsEnsuring that a Title III sale is legal is just the tip of the iceberg. Ongoing reporting and monitoring requirements for both the ventures, the investors and the portals mean that ICGo\u2019s primary business is providing better and better tools to ensure that everyone is in compliance while exerting the lowest possible effort.\u201cThey have streamlined a process and made it work in a really compelling way,\u201d said Aaron Wright, CEO of OpenLaw. ICGo uses OpenLaw to digitally handle the legal documents and smart contracts involved in listing, buying, selling and reporting on the platform.That focus is starting to pay off for everyone. The SEC is likely to adopt new rules in 2023 that significantly increase the amount ventures can raise while reducing \u2014 and in some cases eliminating altogether \u2014 the need to use expensive lawyers and accounting firms. And by 2025, there is a chance that ICGo\u2019s platform will be allowed to include both non-US investments and non-US investors.Just as Uber\u2019s driver ratings reduced the need for expensive taxi-driver-style licensing while increasing overall driver quality control, ICGo\u2019s behind-the-scenes analytics are proving to be far more powerful at reducing fraud and non-compliance than the most expensive accounting audit.Making venture investing easy, global and inexpensive enough to allow one-click $10 trades was anything but easy. It took patience and a willingness to work with government on creative approaches to old problems. This was Emma\u2019s great contribution. Grandma would be proud.But Wait \u2014 There\u2019s a TwistWhat I didn\u2019t tell you about Grandma at the beginning of this story is that she was, in fact, an accredited investor when she got fleeced by the unscrupulous token-scheme. She had a net-worth over one million dollars. So it isn\u2019t surprising that once ICGo got traction, everyone started using it, especially angels trying to keep track of their investments. Even ventures that don\u2019t opt for Title III funding use the platform to manage compliance and cap tables.Even though she could invest far more, Grandma uses ICGo\u2019s \u201cself-control\u201d feature to prevent over-investing by letting her set a limit. And she only invests in companies on the ICGo marketplace in order to avoid shady deals.Today, Emma and Grandma are doing well, thank you very much. :)ConsenSys Web3Studio\u2019s team of designers, developers and writers create user experiences \u201cfrom the near future\u201d as a way to explore novel and (we hope) unexpected ways of using web3 technologies to change how people live and how businesses organize themselves.

Loopring and Dolomite both use QuikNode infrastructure to achieve high-performance and comfort while building their products. Today, we will deep-dive into Loopring\u2019s inner workings, and also look to understand Dolomite, its neat interface and modular approach to building a decentralized exchange (DEX).The Loopring ProtocolLoopring is the name of restless innovation to build a decentralized exchange protocol. If you follow their development, you will understand Loopring\u2019s thirst for problem-solving in the DEX protocol space.A few months back, Loopring introduced protocol version 3.0. In this version, Loopring is leveraging a Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) system to achieve high-transaction throughput. The key idea is to use Ethereum\u2019s blockchain as data storage (efficiently), and the ZKP system to validate the system\u2019s transitions.To achieve scalability, Loopring designed a Merkle tree. Every participant in Loopring\u2019s ecosystem will have an account in this Merkle tree. The Merkle tree also maintains the token balances, as well as trading history for all the participants using the Loopring protocol.By maintaining balances off-chain, updating balances becomes cheap and fast, as we do not need to create a blockchain transaction whenever we update the balance.This Merkle tree\u2019s data persists on Ethereum blockchain to provide data-availability, and anyone can re-create the whole Merkle tree by processing the state transitions stored in Ethereum\u2019s blocks.Loopring\u2019s Merkle TreeHow Does Loopring Work?A Maker creates a buy order. This order goes into an Exchange\u2019s centralized order book. Once this order is matched, an Operator will step into the picture for further processing (*an Exchange can be an Operator too).The Operator\u2019s task is to validate the order and create a Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) for the trades, so Loopring Smart Contracts can perform trade settlement.Let's stop here and first understand the role of an Operator in detail:What is an Operator?In Loopring\u2019s ecosystem, an Operator\u2019s task is similar to that of a miner (e.g. a Bitcoin miner in Bitcoin\u2019s protocol). At any given point in time, this Merkle tree represents the state of the whole Loopring protocol. The state of the Merkle tree transitions to new states when an Operator creates a block.Every block (remember, this is not an Ethereum block) represents a state transition. Deposits, withdrawals, and trades (like events) need to be updated in the Merkle tree by using these state transitions.Operators combine multiple trades and other information in a block and commit these blocks to the Ethereum blockchain. This process is speedy and cheap, but remember this state transition is still not verified.To verify that an Operator has followed the correct rules for creating a block defined by Loopring, the Operator needs to generate a proof for the committed block. This proof will be produced using zk-SNARKs (a Zero-Knowledge system), which is a time-consuming and computation-heavy task.So we now have a \u201cCommit and Verify\u201d system. In the Commit part, an Operator creates a block and commits it on-chain, so other Operators can start building on this newly committed state. In the meantime, the Operator begins working on the proof generation (Verify part). Once the proof is generated, the Operator commits the proof on-chain and the block is verified. This verification is the real finality, as this state can\u2019t be reverted if block is verified and all its previous blocks are also verified in sequence.Loopring Smart Contracts verify these blocks and allow state transition. Once the state is transitioned, Loopring Smart Contracts emit events. Exchanges listen to these events and inform traders about trade settlements.Operators or Exchanges Going RogueA question always comes to mind: what if an Exchange or Operator do not perform their duties, or create a hostile situation? Loopring\u2019s protocol design also prevents these types of cases:To create an Exchange, you need to stake LRC tokens. In a situation where an exchange goes rogue or shuts down abruptly, Loopring protocol starts slashing its stake.Let\u2019s say an Operator does not verify its committed blocks in a given time, Loopring protocol starts withdrawing its committed blocks.Loopring Performance in NumbersUsing off-chain balances and zk-SNARKs, Loopring has the potential to become the fastest DEX protocol in whole Ethereum ecosystem. In Loopring 3.0, it has achieved a high trade throughput with minimum on-chain cost.Loopring Performance ResultsLoopring Token ModelThe most fascinating part is Loopring\u2019s token incentive change. There are two significant changes from previous versions:LRC is no longer a fee-token for trades.LRC can be staked to provide security, reduce trade fees, earn reputation, and reap participation rewards.Protocol FeeIn version 3, Loopring introduced a protocol fee, from 0.001% up to 0.255%. The protocol fee is applied to the token being bought, on the amount bought.Yes, now LRC is not a fee-token anymore. This is not only an improvement in LRC token\u2019s utility model, but will also help in DEX User-Experience (UX). Traders needn\u2019t worry about the protocol fee as DEXs will be responsible to pay this fee on behalf of traders.Protocol Pool Staking (Global)Now, anyone can stake LRC and get a part of 70% of the protocol fees of all exchanges built atop the Loopring protocol.Who: AnyoneHow much: User receives an amount proportional to the amount staked + how long it is stakedHow long: Each token needs to be staked for at least 90 days.Protocol fee pool distribution70% to LRC stakers20% to the yet-to-launch Loopring DAO10% burnedThis model gives a huge incentive to hold LRC as you can stake them to earn protocol fee.Security and Fee reductionAn exchange built atop Loopring needs to stake LRC tokens to operate. This up-front stake ensures user security as DEXs will be punished for their irregular behavior. A DEX can also stake LRC to get a discount on the protocol fees, as well as earn reputation. For more details, read here.Loopring version 3.0 design has been stress-tested and the numbers are fascinating. If you want to understand Loopring\u2019s new design in detail, read here.Now let\u2019s talk about Dolomite DEX!Dolomite DEXNow that we understand how Loopring is going to change the DEX landscape, let\u2019s also look at Dolomite, a decentralized exchange built using Loopring v3!What is Dolomite?Dolomite is a decentralized exchange with goals to solve scalability and UX problems (common among DEXs), using the Loopring protocol. Dolomite takes a modular approch for building a DEX and aims to build all the blocks which will provide for a complete trading experience for traders.How does Dolomite work?Let\u2019s understand Dolomite in comparison to a centralized exchange (CEX).In a CEX, exchanges take the custody of your funds. With Dolomite, Smart Contracts take custody of your funds (these Smart Contracts are openly-verifiable and audited).When you create an order on a CEX, it goes to a central CEX database. With Dolomite, it\u2019s the same. A cryptographically signed order will go to Dolomite\u2019s centralized database.When an order matches, the CEX executes the order and updates your token balances. In Dolomite, when an order matches, Dolomite sends the request to Loopring\u2019s protocol, which then settles the order.The main point to notice here is that Dolomite will never have control of your funds, eliminating the security risk. Funds are controlled by Smart Contracts created by Loopring and governed by the Ethereum blockchain. If a user wants to withdraw their funds, the protocol ensures that no one restricts the withdrawal.Why is Dolomite different?Most DEXs suffer from a liquidity problem. Ethereum process around 15 transactions/second and every dApp built atop Ethereum has to share this transaction throughput. Dolomite and Loopring both understand this problem and use the Ethereum blockchain optimally (only for final trade settlement).By using the Loopring protocol, Dolomite is ready to achieve >200 transactions/sec throughput, which is quite remarkable (as most DEXs process around 2\u20135 transactions/second). Loopring not only provides high transaction throughput but also solves the front-running problem with Dual Authoring.The front-running problem paralyzes DEXs, where an order is fulfilled by entities who are responsible for processing the order/transaction (e.g. Miners, Relayers, Ring Matchers, or Operators).Dolomite TechDolomite has one of the fastest matching engines, built using the Akka framework (written in Java/Scala). It enables Dolomite to process more than 5 million trades/sec.Dolomite Portfolio ManagerDolomite has also built a Portfolio Manager, which shows their commitment to building an open & transparent DEX solution, and providing all useful tools to their users. Even if you don\u2019t do crypto trading, you can still use the Portfolio Manager as a stand-alone solution. It shows all of your transactions and trades in a single place, with beautiful visualizations. The best part is that Dolomite does not retain this information.Try DolomiteDolomite is currently in beta stage, but you can check out the platform and play around with it. Dolomite also created APIs for third-party apps, so if you are a developer, you can build cool things with Dolomite.DEXs & Traders using QuikNodeQuikNode is used by DEXs and traders alike.DEXs require speed to deliver a fast & fluid user experience. QuikNode dedicated Ethereum nodes are some of the most performative Ethereum nodes in the ecosystem.With 8 node locations around the world, dApp operators can minimize network hops and latency by spinning up a node closest to their web/app servers and users.Most web3 and eth APIs (httpProvider or websocket) are supported, including txpool and pendingTransactions, as well as event subscriptions (PUB/SUB) and transaction batching.Receive data quicker, react quicker.Traders also use QuikNode to their advantage when the Ethereum blockchain becomes congested (or public node services are degraded), also giving them the ability to push more transactions per block.QuikNode and Web3 InfrastructureQuikNode is all about helping developers and entrepreneurs build applications for the Web3 ecosystem. We worked with both Loopring and Dolomite to provide powerful Ethereum node infrastructure, and also reducing their business and developer costs for maintaining Ethereum nodes in-house.QuikNode Ethereum nodes provide a high-performance API endpoint so Web3 products can deliver the best user experience to their customers.QuikNode is fully committed to providing the most high-performing and reliable Web3 infrastructure, and supporting the ecosystem in every manner.About QuikNodeQuikNode.io is building infrastructure to support the future of Web3. Since 2017, we\u2019ve worked with hundreds of developers & companies, helping scale dApps and providing high-performance Ethereum nodes.

The internet now connects more than 3.2 billion people around the globe, which represents 55% of the global population. This number only continues to grow and it\u2019s not hard to imagine that one day, everyone in the world will have consistent, regular internet access.Already, the internet has provided a massive evolution in the way humanity learns and collaborates. Just like the revolutionary Gutenberg Press gave substantially more people access to books, the internet has presented humanity with a wealth of interconnectedness and information like never before. Having access to all of the world\u2019s knowledge in your pocket used to be a science fiction dream; now it\u2019s reality.While the raw amount of data being transferred is definitely growing, the time we are spending processing it scales at almost the same rate. We are connecting to the internet earlier and more often than ever before, further cementing the web as a critical, central component of our lives. Primary schools have implemented web navigation and strategies into their curriculum, and online access is becoming increasingly necessary to early and continuing education. Some children are even learning coding concepts in elementary school, a clear sign that the internet is empowering individuals of all ages and the consumption of data starts much earlier than it did a decade ago. It is a very powerful and advanced tool that has the ability to change the world for decades to come, and everyone should have an equal opportunity to connect.When the internet was first created as a research project connecting universities, no one could have predicted how it would grow, morph, or transform into what it is today. A huge part of this exponential growth and adoption is that the internet gives everyone the ability to join and create. There\u2019s no access fee and there\u2019s no tier structure; if you have internet access, you can directly communicate with anyone else with internet access. This free access regime caused an explosion of creativity, opportunity, and new ideas. The creators of Google, MapQuest, Wikipedia, Craigslist, eBay, etc., didn\u2019t need permission to start their life-changing projects.Unfortunately, this open, transformative power is under threat and may start to become curtailed.Net NeutralityYou may have heard of \u201cnet neutrality,\u201d or the idea that all sites and services on the internet should be granted equal access to any internet user. Net neutrality proponents aim to keep all internet traffic democratized and ensure data from a small, one-man startup is treated with the same consideration as that of today\u2019s Google, Microsoft, or another cloud giant, just like Google had when it was starting out.Net neutrality activists seek to preserve the right to freely use your internet access for whichever services you like. Net neutrality prevents ISPs from giving preferential treatment to certain services, such as big cloud corporations, that pay the providers an incentive to provide enhanced speed to their content. If we lose net neutrality, these ISPs could throttle bandwidth when accessing other, smaller websites and services that provide better prices, products, or enhanced utility. While this is great for big businesses, it limits innovation because these smaller platforms cannot generally afford to pay the premium costs to these providers, even if the service they offer is better than others. Imagine what would\u2019ve happened if Facebook was difficult-to-impossible to access in its early days because MySpace had paid for preferential treatment.A loss of net neutrality affects content providers as well. Without net neutrality, ISPs have the ability to charge extra fees for any services they want. In this scenario, if an end-user is using a media streaming service like Netflix or YouTube, Netflix or YouTube could also be forced to pay additional fees.Just imagine surfing an online store and, while scrolling through the articles, suddenly the internet connection is throttled (on either end) because of \u201cunusual usage metrics\u201d or because the service you are using doesn\u2019t pay your ISP a premium to use its \u201cfast lane.\u201d This may degrade your experience or even prevent you from buying the items you were searching for (at the price you wanted), because you simply cannot access the site offering it.ISPs Bandwidth Caps Slow the Flow of Data OnlineThe potential loss of net neutrality isn\u2019t the only threat to a free and open internet. Bandwidth caps constitute an additional, and often artificially imposed, limitation that impacts the future potential of the internet. Bandwidth caps are often applied evenly to all websites, and so they do not typically garner the same attention as discussions around net neutrality. That being so, bandwidth caps still have the ability to impose an unnecessary stifling effect on the growth of internet innovation.Many ISP plans nowadays advertise their impressive bandwidth speeds, which any consumer would aspire to take full advantage of, especially as the amount of data we consume online continues to increase. Bandwidth caps can have a huge impact on ISP customers, depending on location, costs, and common practices employed in each region.Without calling out specific ISPs and making a more formal comparison, we have found that in more and more locations gigabit fiber lines are being offered with a mere 1 TB traffic cap for private usage. Doing a quick estimate, this would only allow for a maximum of 380 KB/s or 3 Mbit/s of bandwidth usage for the entire month, if we want to avoid hitting this invisible ceiling. ADSL connections over phone lines in 1998 were up to 2\u20134 times faster! If the full gigabit of throughput were constantly utilized, the bandwidth cap would be hit in just 2 hours and 25 minutes. To put it in perspective, users are offered a 1000 Mbit/s plan to access the web but are limited to using only about 0.3% of its maximum capabilities.Bandwidth caps disproportionately affect decentralized applications, and in many cases, ISPs have implemented bandwidth caps to reduce the usage of peer-to-peer software. Peer-to-peer applications often use more \u201cedge\u201d traffic, instead of the typical \u201chub-and-spoke\u201d model used by centralized services today, where client computers only talk with a handful of central servers (\u201cthe cloud\u201d).Though it\u2019s a common practice for an ISP to try and limit peer-to-peer software usage, it would be in any ISP\u2019s interest to work more closely with peer-to-peer services. These services typically pay upfront capital expenditures (one-time costs) for their networks, and only pay operational expenditures (ongoing costs) for traffic that leaves their network for other networks. ISPs could benefit significantly by encouraging users to use peer-to-peer services that prioritize keeping traffic within an ISP\u2019s network, which would help the ISP skip the ongoing operational expenditures for inter-network traffic.Web 3.0\u2019s Impact on the Way We Use the InternetThe throttling and bandwidth-cap problems that impact the internet now will compound with web 3.0, as the interaction with each service gets more bidirectional. In the early days of the internet (web 1.0) almost all use was \u201cread,\u201d in that we didn\u2019t interact with one another or services much \u2014 if at all. With web 2.0, we began to \u201cwrite,\u201d with services like social media, blogs and other platforms that allowed us to begin interacting with one another. This began to create an environment where we begin uploading data, in addition to downloading, starting the trend of bidirectional usage. Web 3.0 will take this to the next stage, creating an internet that is programmable.Throttling and bandwidth caps have the potential to impact one\u2019s ability to interact with this emerging programmable internet that is web 3.0. Without the ability for everyone to consume these new web offerings freely, the goal of web 3.0 cannot be fully realized and those that do not have access will be left behind.Net neutrality legislation has strived to keep the internet free and open, but removing bandwidth caps is also an important topic to address. Net neutrality ensures all participants are treated equally; eliminating bandwidth caps ensures that all technologies and network architectures are treated equally.In the US and other countries, net neutrality legislation has been shut down, essentially putting the power back into the hands of internet service providers. ISPs use this power to limit data transfers for specific applications and throttle users\u2019 ability to access data once they hit a certain usage level, which hurts consumers and stifles innovation. Bandwidth caps get less focus, but have also been creeping up significantly in the last decade.Impact and Opportunities for Storj\u2019s Decentralized Cloud StorageStorage is the foundation to the cloud and now that web 3.0 development is starting to really gain momentum, our decentralized cloud storage network will be a critical component to this evolving future. Our platform stores our users\u2019 personal, client-side encrypted data across many nodes spread all over the globe, rather than in a single, siloed data center, which would be more prone to natural disasters or attacks and costs several million to build and maintain.To achieve maximum performance and resilience in file storage over the upcoming decades, some measures are required to ensure that node failures, network outages and similar problems, will not cause data loss. In our newly released V3 white paper, we outline how our new network aims to achieve much better bandwidth efficiency by switching from predominantly using replication across many nodes to pure erasure encoding (see our recent blog post here). The goal is to use only the bare minimum of bandwidth needed to maintain the above-mentioned metrics and to reserve most of the available bandwidth for fast download and (especially) uploads of our users\u2019 files.While net neutrality will help support the web 3.0 future, our new network is designed to minimize possible delivery bottlenecks by fetching and streaming data from many different locations across the world. The power of using small fragments called erasure shares (in the small kilobyte range) helps our platform succeed regardless of what conditions are placed upon the internet on which it runs.Storj Labs remains committed to fighting for the free and open internet, both in support of net neutrality, and in support of fighting unnecessary bandwidth caps, both of which present huge hurdles to humanities ongoing quest to innovate. With web 3.0 on the horizon, it is critical that we consider how failing to address these problems could affect people in less developed countries, impede individual innovators with little power and influence, and slow down the ever-evolving internet.By Stefan Benten, Strategy R&D Engineer at Storj LabsOriginally published at storj.io on December 13, 2018.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Net Neutrality", "Web3", "Cloud Computing", "Innovation", "Decentralization"]}, {"title": "There are almost definitely more \u2018cryptokitty\u2019 moments yet to come", "post_link": "https://medium.com/metacartel/there-are-almost-definitely-more-cryptokitty-moments-yet-to-come-18caf053d7fd?source=search_post", "author_name": "pet3rpan", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@pet3rpan", "publish_date": "2018-12-30", "last_modified_date": "2019-04-26", "readtime": "3.60", "claps": 164, "voters": 7, "content": "There are almost definitely more \u2018cryptokitty\u2019 moments yet to comeHidden truths of social facing web 3.0pet3rpanFollowDec 30, 2018 \u00b7 4 min readCryptokitties launched on the 28th of November 2017 and within under one month, their platform soon averaged just under 18,000 trades per day \u2014 where for a short while, the platform completely congested the Ethereum blockchain. Not long after, they are soon backed by a16z and Union Square Ventures, raising 12 million dollars. So, the million dollar question is:Why did digital cat trading become one of the first major applications of Web 3.0?Why did digital cats take off?Did it ride the wave of hype around crypto at the time? Was it driven the community\u2019s enthusiasm with unstoppable web3 technologies \u2014 where this was just one of the more engaging demos that had been produced? Or was this craze another absurdist expression of internet culture?While I believe all such factors definitely played a large role behind the success of the Cryptokitties, through my own observations, I am inclined to believe that there is a more subtle truth to the cryptokitties craze.What is the point of digital cats?Crypokitties don\u2019t solve a well defined hard problem or provide any specific value to people. It is a toy, open for interpreted use and play. There is no point to it really. And for that exact reason is why I think it is such a fascinating product to observe.Yet despite that, people: Show off their cats to others to earn respect, trade it to earn money off the internal economy, send cats as a proof of affection \u2014when I browse through the marketplace for cats to buy, I am on a bus with nothing else to do, scanning a filtered selection of the cheapest cats available. I look through the various attributes, colours, shapes, stylings and descriptions of the cats. And when I find an interesting looking cat which I kind of like, I buy it.The self-explanatory nature of the Cryptokitties gives way to a personal expression of individualism and creativity. Driven by an amorphous spirit of the internet culture, Cryptokitties was able to act as a figurative blank canvas, teasing out the curiosities of human behaviours and motivations surrounding the mental model of digital collectables.\u201cI am PICKING this cat because I personally like it. I am CHOOSING to send this cat to you because I think it fits you\u201dThe reasons why people buy and play with Cryptokitties are almost endless and dramatically unexpected at times. But I ultimately hypothesize that at the crux of it, it is a creative form of human expression. But was this new form of expression influenced by the underlying use of Web3 3.0 tech?While on the surface you could probably call out how a typical database could of served the needs of the platform, but could you argue how our awareness of the underlying tech changed the mental model in which we perceive it as well as how we approached the use of the Cryptokitty collectible?I think yes \u2014 but in an extremely subtle manner.Such an example begs the question about what other web3 technologies, once framed in the right way, can lead to new ways in how we socially communicate with each other through a global distributed state machine.How will Web 3.0 technology enable new interactions, value, behaviours?I think at this point, especially with so much user experience infrastructure now made readily available, we can readily begin to further understand our digital culture in relation to web3. And this starts with experimentation of new web3 products and greater observation around our relationship with it. Besides Crypokitties, we have also seen many more hints surrounding what our relationship with Web3 technology will look like in the future:ICOs \u2014 Broke the psychological \u2018fourth wall\u2019 of money and investing. People have never been this much control and intimacy with their own money.FOAM \u2014 People like staking real life geo-location points on an interactive digital map! Remember how fun Google Earth was? While we are inherently fascinated with our real world (Pokemon Go) and the planet we live on, what fascinates each of us so much about it through Web3?SuperRare \u2014 Why do artists like producing for the platform? Is it due to the fact that their artwork lives on forever? What draws people to want to create NFT art works as well as buy them?While many of the products listed are used out of novelty and superficial reasons, I think the reason why they have captured some level of attention, if not fascination, are due to the rather hidden reasons for which we cannot yet comprehend.Is a non-obvious truth simply staring us in the face all this time? Are we missing anything here?Being a rather more paranoid product person, I beg others to also question the state of web3 interactions and also to dig deeper beyond the surface.The truth is subtle and is yet to be properly understood but will come with time. Food for thought.The next big thing will start out looking like a toyOne of the amazing things about the internet economy is how different the list of top internet properties today looks\u2026cdixon.orgWinner Takes MostThe history of the Internet and mobile is that in many categories the winner takes most of the market: Search - Google\u2026avc.com", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Cryptokitties", "Web3", "Ethereum", "Cryptocurrency"]}, {"title": "Polkadot Governance", "post_link": "https://medium.com/tokyo-fintech/polkadot-governance-8d81e91ea975?source=search_post", "author_name": "Norbert Gehrke", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@norbert.gehrke", "publish_date": "2018-12-05", "last_modified_date": "2018-12-05", "readtime": "3.16", "claps": 45, "voters": 8, "content": "Polkadot GovernanceNorbert GehrkeFollowDec 5, 2018 \u00b7 4 min readGavin Wood presenting on Polkadot governance in TokyoParity Technologies and the Web3 Foundation Team stopped over in Tokyo and gave a series of highly educational presentations at the Polkadot Meetup, with Gavin Wood in particular focusing on governance. In addition, Ryan Zurrer provided a comprehensive assessment of the state of Web3, and Robert Habermeier explained Substrate.The Polkadot governance mechanismPolkadot proposes various ways in which motions can be proposed. A key element of the governance structure is the council, for which 12 or 24 representatives will be elected on a rotating basis so that the term for the council members ends up to be a full year. Gavin also highlighted that the votes for runner-ups will be carried forward, so that it is much more of continuous election, whereby votes can be accumulated over time, and the highest ranking candidate will get her turn during the next cycle.The council may cancel a motion by unanimous vote, e.g. in cases where it is obvious to all that the technical implementation of a proposal is impossible or detrimental to the overall system. Individual council member may also veto a motion, but only once, which would lead to a 2 or 4 week cooling-off period during which further debate is possible. This feature is intended to be used if one council member feels strongly against a motion, and the rest of the council might be lukewarm for it, so it provides for a little more time to convince the majority.Polkadot voting mechanism with voluntary lockingThe power of votes in the Polkadot governance system is determined by the willingness of voters to lock up their tokens for specific periods of time. The longer the lockup, the more the vote counts. In the example on the top of the above picture, Alice has one vote, but is willing to lock up her token for four periods (8 weeks), so her vote counts four. Bob has three tokens, which he is willing to lock up for three periods (6 weeks), so his vote counts nine. Charlie has four tokens that he only locks up for the standard period. With a weighted vote of nine for (Bob) and eight (Alice & Charlie) against, the motion is accepted and will be implemented after a cooling off period of two weeks. That two-week delay allows those that have lost the vote to exit the system (sell their tokens) if they desire to do so. Also, only the winners\u2019 tokens are locked up, not the tokens committed to the losing vote. The example at the bottom of the picture shows a corresponding win of the vote against.Adaptive quorum biasingLastly, Polkadot implements adaptive quorum biasing. What sounds terribly complicated, is simply taking the voter participation in consideration when determining the majority needed to win (positive turnout bias) or reject (negative turnout bias) a motion. The lower the voter participation is, the higher a majority of the participating vote is required to win the motion. Naturally, with 100% participation, a simple majority suffices. Once participation drops to 50%, 59% of the turnout, equalling to 29% of the total population, is required. The curves for positive and negative turnout bias are simply mirror images of each other.This article was intended to highlight just a few aspects of Polkadot governance that have been discussed at the Polkadot meetup.

Today we\u2019re announcing a major upgrade to the Cent ecosystem that puts us squarely on the cutting edge of decentralized UX.Up until now, you\u2019ve always needed to use something like Metamask, or Trust Wallet, or some other Web3 Wallet extension or browser in order to access Cent. Personally, I\u2019ve always hated the fact that this has been necessary. Normal people don\u2019t download extensions to use websites. Normal people go to websites, login, and use them. Having to download some separate thing to use a thing makes the whole thing feel way too esoteric and complicated.So, last night, in the culmination of months of work, we launched our integration with the awesome team from Fortmatic. Anyone can now use Cent from any browser, without needing a Chrome extension, or a dApp browser. It\u2019s hard to express how huge this is for Cent\u2019s mainstream adoption.Goodbye extensions, hello future.Internally, we\u2019ve had a process going we called \u201cKill The Fox\u201d (referring to the Metamask logo). We\u2019ve wanted to make Metamask and things like it unnecessary, but for a long time there were no solid technical solutions to getting around the need for them. But humans are amazing and now it\u2019s possible thanks to the team at Fortmatic. Just login with your mobile number and email, and you\u2019re good to go. Use Cent from mobile Safari, your Android phone, your 2005 Palm Treo, or whatever.Using the new Cent is super simple. When you access it from a new device for the first time, you\u2019ll receive an SMS verification message in order to login and verify your Fortmatic account. Every subsequent Fortmatic login on that device will be a 6-digit pin (with no SMS). Logged in, users will be asked to click a simple button that verifies their account when they want to seed, bounty or do anything with their money. It\u2019s one click \u2014 super easy, super scalable, super accessible to normal people. We\u2019re so excited.Thank you to the entire Fortmatic team for being so great to work with, looking forward to continuing to collab with you all.Note: This is only Part I of our Spring Update. If you can believe it, we have an even larger release coming very soon \u2014 one that will change the scope of Cent forever.

"Here\u2019s Who Built on Quorum at ETH DenverA smooth web3 experience with permissioned features, a security token platform with privacy features, and a supply chain use-case on Quorum.Matt WrightFollowFeb 21 \u00b7 5 min readETHDenver \u2014 oh, the land of Bufficorns and Ethereum developers!The Quorum team was lucky enough to make it out to Denver, Colorado to meet with all kinds of interesting people BUIDLing for web3 and beyond. The amount of projects buidl-ing on top of Ethereum, MakerDAO, POA, Zeppelin \u2014 to name a few \u2014 were just mind blowing.I\u2019ll tell ya, if you\u2019ve been to one of these Ethereum ecosystem events, you know the feeling. The thrill of being around the Ethereum community and truly experiencing a future with distributed technologies first hand \u2014 and without just discussing it all day \u2014 can make your brain numb. I could go on all day about how amazing the event was, but I\u2019ll let you read about it, here.That being said \u2014 we were excited to work with teams that wanted \u201cbuidl\u201d on Quorum.We offered three (3) bounties to give developers a little incentive. We were looking for projects that had the best use of Quorum\u2019s privacy features, best use of Quorum\u2019s performance/ transaction speed, and the best use of any public Ethereum tools with Quorum.And we received some pretty awesome submissions!1. TidbitsTeam Members: Bradley Clarke, Gabe Ibarra, Taylor DawsonTidbits Architecture via Bradley ClarkeTidbits is web3 with no extensions, no modals, just flow. That being said, you can offload the tricky stuff to the network. This is a simple game with a simple experience where you assemble brief poems like word magnets. Visitors to the site who arrive without an in browser wallet are given a key. A unique contract then manages gas for the user, ensuring that there is always just enough (test) ETH in their wallet to keep playing. Tidbits is a great use-case for Quorum, and ended up making it to Top 20 on the main stage!Here\u2019s their full tech stack:Dapp runs on Quorum POA networkCustom Oracle using ION protocol bridges Rinkeby to POA networkDecentral Key / Transaction manager accepts login from OAuth provider (Google) to create keys for user.

RTokenTeam Members: Shane Jarvie, Elena De La Paz, Ryan HallRToken Architecture via Shane JarvieRToken is a token issuance and trading platform combining the open source R-Token compliance standard for digital securities with the institutional grade privacy features of the Quorum blockchain. This security token platform leverages the R-Token protocol and Quorum for global regulation while preserving issuer and transaction privacy. Yeah, it\u2019s a mouthful \u2014 but it\u2019s pretty awesome nonetheless.For the compliance aspect, they implemented the industry standard ERC-20 method of transfer() and transferFrom() with an additional check to determine whether or not a transfer should be allowed to proceed. The implementation of check() can take many forms, but a default whitelist approach is implemented by TokenRegulatorService. Token and participant-level permissions, when used in different combinations, can be used to satisfy multiple regulatory exemptions. The ServiceRegistry is included as a mechanism to facilitate upgrading the R-Token check logic as rules change over time. This R-Token then leverages the Quorum privacy platform by allowing issuers to share knowledge of state while remaining agnostic to each other\u2019s trades.This allows for issuers to only view their own token balances and state, while querying a global regulator service when attempting to make a transaction, and for no public entity outside of the regulator to be able to view all issuer transactions.The RToken team also built a stunning user interface which you should definitely try out!Here\u2019s their full tech stack:QuorumSolidityReactDockerGithub: https://github.com/sjarvie/rtoken_quorum3. GeoHunterTeam Members: Bryce Doganer, Andy Watt, Gareth Oates, Colin McCrae, Lucas HenningGeoHunter is a tracking DApp in treasure hunt format that consists of a series of QR codes which must be scanned by users in the correct order. Each QR code has an associated picture stored on IPFS which shows its location, with the IPFS hash (and all user and tag data) stored on the blockchain. The fastest user to scan all the QR codes in the correct order wins. A leaderboard can be viewed showing the fastest times, and the status of players currently on the treasure hunt. The DApp is hosted on a Quorum node on AWS. What\u2019s cool is that this project is the basis for a supply chain item tracking DApp which is in line with UN Sustainable Development Goal 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth.

No, Lennon wasn\u2019t a futurist or a techie, but he understood the human need to make a positive impact on the world.Most of us have lived through the tremendous impact of Web2. The global changes have been transformative. To attempt a recap would exhaust us all. But like any other innovation, Web2 is reaching its growth limits and users want more. Luckily, Web3 is on the horizon proposing a new internet architecture and a new way to connect \u2014 peer-to-peer, without intermediaries, using distributed systems, employing a new trust infrastructure. In Web3, individuals will be able to participate in a real and meaningful way in changing the world around them. By leveraging blockchain\u2019s built-in trust infrastructure, we can create a \u201chuman-centered\u201d internet that can transport us from \u201ceCommerce\u201d to \u201cweCommerce\u201d, from \u201ccompetition\u201d to \u201ccoopetion,\u201d and from \u201cnothing at stake\u201d to \u201cproof of stake.\u201dThe move from centralization to decentralization offers us all a chance to change the world \u2014 to develop a Web3 that is owned by everyone, where everyone is incentivized to create value.This shift from a centralized Web2 to a decentralized Web3 is important for companies to understand because it signals a radical change. The \u201cnature of the firm\u201d \u2014 the reason firms exist and how they provide value to their customers \u2014 will fundamentally change. Firms will need to reconsider how their company delivers products and services or they will perish. In order to remain viable, firms will need to adopt open protocols, such as public blockchains, that allow anyone to participate.So why do we need to get to Web3 and how do we do it? Here\u2019s why and how.RevolutionFirst, let\u2019s consider that Web3 is a revolution and consumers are already preparing to strike. Articles like this one, \u201cYes, You Should Delete Facebook,\u201d make a strong case for unsubscribing from Facebook and other platforms that try to control and benefit from our conversations. If you haven\u2019t already noticed, \u201cFacebook\u2019s product is not the platform, it\u2019s us. If the product is what a business sells to make money, then Facebook\u2019s product is our attention and data. We are the product. And Facebook\u2019s customers are the companies buying ads based on that attention and data.\u201d Our data is sourced for profit. Our minds sourced for manipulation.Today, companies like Facebook and Google have too much control over users and the internet. We know this because back in June 2017, the European Union fined Google $2.7 billion for manipulating search results. The issue was that search results favored Google\u2019s own services rather than rival shopping services. Bad news for small business with manipulation and control at its best.But consumers are getting savvier and increasingly have more choices over which service providers to choose and how they communicate. One fresh choice over Facebook, for example, is blockchain-based social media company Steemit, which rewards content creators and curators for contributions to its blogging website. Anyone adding value to the site gets paid in tradeable, digital STEEM tokens. The more posts and upvotes (likes) you get, the more tokens you receive. When was the last time Facebook paid you to post a status update?Another new choice is uPort, which allows users to control their own data. Now we can decide where our data goes and how it is used. It will be our choice whether to revoke rights to other and thereby break the connection to our profiles. With uPort, consumers decide where and how their data is used. In classic power-to-the-people revolutionary style, uPort believes that \u201ceveryone has the right to control their own digital identity \u2014 how it\u2019s shaped, shared and sustained.\u201d Users can register their own identity on the Ethereum blockchain, send and request credentials, sign transactions, and securely manage keys and data. This is what rebellion + blockchain looks like in Web3.EvolutionOk, if you think the revolution analogy is a bit much, then consider Web3 architecture as the natural evolution of human behavior. Through social media, Web2 allows us to connect and interact like never before. In an instant, we can read the latest news, watch videos from around the world, and communicate with like-minded people anywhere. Add Web3 and we can now use blockchain technology to change the world.Take blockchain-based ixo.foundation, for example, which was created to track and value the impact of contributions on people and the planet. It\u2019s now possible to go from centralized Web2 organizations focused on commerce and profit to cost-effective, highly impactful projects that enable anyone to become a stakeholder in the projects they believe in. One ixo project, Amply, uses a mobile app built to track attendance in pre-schools in South Africa.The mission of ixo.foundation is big, hairy, and audacious. \u201cWhat if we could end poverty, protect the planet, no person gets left behind?\u201d But that\u2019s the promise of Web3 \u2014 to support us in achieving the next level of evolution.Go Far\u201cIf you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.\u201d ~African proverbAnother great Web3 business model is blockchain-based Kambria. Kambria is leveraging the power of community to go far instead of fast. It is choosing \u201ccoopetition\u201d over \u201ccompetition\u201d by creating an open innovation protocol that allows developers to work on frontier technology projects together. Unfortunately, today a lot of development work is fragmented or siloed across different environments such as university research, where millions of dollars of waste are created after projects are left unutilized. Moreover, stand-alone companies often invest heavily into R&D and then build a moat of patents and secrets around their inventions to prevent others from innovating on top of their ideas. And tech developed by startups that go belly up is lost forever.Projects keep pieces of the puzzle to themselves since there is no mechanism to benefit from sharing. That\u2019s what Kambria is trying to change. Kambria is creating repositories for hardware and software components spanning many tech verticals such as robotics, artificial intelligence, drones, self-driving cars, space technology, biomedicine and more. The repositories will be linked to foster collaboration across verticals. For example, autonomous robots will share certain technology components with self-driving cars.Kambria\u2019s founders developed their own telepresence robot under a company called OhmniLabs, so they understand the hard work of innovating from scratch. Rather than keep all of the tech from that project to themselves, they are contributing it to the Kambria platform. All technology on Kambria will be open and free to use for personal and R&D purposes, with the option for a licensing fee for commercial and enterprise purposes. This collaborative, open approach \u2014 managed on the blockchain \u2014 is truly the next wave in innovation.Go Far, QuicklyWhile blockchain technology is not a viable solution for every company, it is sufficiently important to consider. How can you take part in the revolution by helping customers participate in the collective action of business? Can you employ smart contracts as \u201cautomated trust\u201d to facilitate the interactions your customers value? Can you secure customer records or data on an immutable blockchain?Recently, Forbes committed to regularly publishing content on the blockchain through a partnership with Civil. One possible outcome is that doing so will increase trust with its audience and lead to new forms of engagement. Forbes is one of the oldest and well-known brands in journalism. It is also one of the most innovative.And earlier this month, Microsoft chose to open-source over 60,000 patents as a member of the Open Innovation Network. Joining the open-source community, which Microsoft shunned in the past, demonstrates a new way of thinking for the tech behemoth. In the 80s and 90s, Microsoft was the world\u2019s largest software company. But the \u201cWindows Era\u201d has come and gone, and today, over 60% of web servers run open-source Linux. Microsoft even runs Linux on about one-third of Microsoft cloud computing service, Microsoft Azure. The server war goes to the Linux army.Microsoft has learned its lesson. It could not compete against the biggest cooperative software effort on the planet developing free, powerful software with no strings attached. This is what Web3 looks like \u2014 open, distributed, consensus-based. Awesome.So how do you get to Web3? Re-examine the way your company delivers its products and services. Take a look at how you incentivize customers. And figure out whether you\u2019re more of a David or Goliath, Microsoft or Linux.As an extension of Web2, one war that will be waged in Web3 is the war over data capture. The firms who have the most data will win. At least that\u2019s what Google hopes as it continues to create data farms; currently, Google has over 2.5 million servers. Similar to Facebook, Google profits from acquiring user data and selling that data to advertisers. Will you be able to compete against giants or will you need to adopt an open approach to innovation? The choice is yours.In 1970, Gil Scott-Hereon wrote a poem and a song entitled, \u201cThe Revolution Will Not be Televised.\u201d The song\u2019s title comes from a popular slogan used in the 1960s Black Power movement in the United States. It has been referenced in pop culture ever since. Here is the Web3 version.The Revolution Will Not Be CentralizedYou will not stay siloed, brotherYou will not be able to plug in, turn on, and cash outYou will not be able to addict your viewers through scroll and streamSell out your audience to sell more commercialsBecause the revolution will not be centralizedThe revolution will not be centralizedThe revolution will not be brought to you by FacebookOr by a Netflix binge without commercial interruptionThe revolution will not publish news about you and your friendsMaking money on clicks garnered by listening to conversationsConfiscated from private data and days of attentionThe revolution will not be centralizedLaura Guy for the Kambria NetworkWebsite: https://kambria.io/Whitepaper: http://bit.ly/2JbuET7Telegram (ENG): https://t.me/kambriaofficialTelegram (KOR): https://t.me/KambriaKoreaTelegram (VIE): https://t.me/KambriaVietnamTelegram (CHN): https://t.me/KambriaChinaTwitter: https://twitter.com/KambriaNetworkFacebook Page: https://facebook.com/KambriaNetworkFacebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/kambria/Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/KambriaOfficial/Medium (ENG): https://medium.com/kambria-networkMedium (CHN): https://Medium.com/kambriachinaSteemit: https://steemit.com/@kambrianetworkWeibo (CHN): https://www.weibo.com/kambriachinaEmail: info@kambria.io", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Web3", "Thought Leadership", "Kambria", "Cryptocurrency"]}, {"title": "FanClub Turns Fans Into \u201cFanchises\u201d", "post_link": "https://medium.com/web3studio/fanclub-turns-fans-into-fanchises-ba58e42be521?source=search_post", "author_name": "John Wolpert", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@jwolpert", "publish_date": "2019-08-29", "last_modified_date": "2019-08-30", "readtime": "5.58", "claps": 65, "voters": 3, "content": "FanClub Turns Fans Into \u201cFanchises\u201dAnother Web3 Product Story by ConsenSys Web3StudioJohn WolpertFollowAug 29 \u00b7 6 min read(All Web3Studio stories are fiction\u2026until they aren\u2019t. This story is based on a world where the Ethereum blockchain was already around in the early 90s and could enable FanClub to support a young Derek Jeter in high school.)Photo by Steshka Willems from PexelsDo I know Derek Jeter? Let me tell you about Derek Jeter. I\u2019m not just his #1 fan. I was literally his #1 fan from the beginning. Don\u2019t believe me? Go check out his FanClub token on the Ethereum mainnet (yeah, we\u2019ve been at this so long that our token is on the root coordinating chain of the Internet, not a sidechain or shard).See the account number right at the top? That\u2019s me. Here\u2019s my Selfie ID to prove it. And you\u2019ll notice that my membership seat has never changed hands. I never lost faith, and I never sold my seat. I\u2019m an original. And partly thanks to FanClub, that faith has paid off in many ways.Derek wasn\u2019t always the player we know today. He struggled. Played minor league ball. Worked his ass off. Had setbacks. But at least he had us, his fanchise, the Jeter Giants.Why do we call ourselves the \u201cJeter Giants\u201d? Jeter, because, duh, and Giants, because the first ten of us who bought seats on his fanchise were friends and family who saw him play (and learned to believe in him) when he was at Kalamazoo Central High School. Go Giants! (Yeah, I know\u2026little confusing for a Yankees fan, but it\u2019s true \u2014 Derek was a Giant before he was a Yankee.)Like a lot of budding athletes, Derek had a ton of expenses. Through hard work and a supportive family, the Jeters managed to cover many of these, but thanks to the funds in the Jeter Giants fanchise, Derek was able to get special coaching and several key trips funded when he was still in high school. (The way the FanClub contract works, it doesn\u2019t violate NCAA rules, so budding athletes get the support they need without jeopardizing their eligibility to play college sports.) And the backing helped even more when he was slogging away through the minors.More Than GoFundMeThis is something I really like about FanClub. It\u2019s about supporting our Stars \u2014 that\u2019s what we call them. In that way, it\u2019s kind of like Kickstarter or GoFundMe. But FanClub gave us a lot more incentive to kick-in, because it wasn\u2019t just giving Derek money out of the goodness of our hearts. It gives back through ownership in the Derek Jeter Fanchise, a legal entity that can take in and distribute revenue to us, the Franchisers, according to a royalty distribution formula in our smart contract on the blockchain.Here\u2019s How I Make MoneyAs one of the founding members of the Jeter Giants, I don\u2019t have to pay an annual membership to keep my seat. But everyone below each of the ten founders does, every year. And that fee is set by the market. You can imagine what a seat on Derek Jeter\u2019s fanchise goes for these days!There are a very limited number of fanchise seats. It\u2019s capped at 1610. The ten Tier-One members can have up to ten Tier-Two members under them. The Tier-One members get a percentage of the member fees of the Tiers below them. Each Tier-Two member can have up to five members below them. Finally, each Tier-Three member can have two fee-paying members.FanClub fanchises are small and can\u2019t grow beyond 1610 members, ever. In the first two years, the fanchise is limited to 110, two tiers (T1=10, T2=100). After two years, and under specific rules, a third tier of 500 can be added, and ultimately, if the Star has gone pro, and if there is demand, then a final Tier of 1000 can be added. The Jeter Giants reached the \u201c1610 club\u201d years ago.As one of the ten in the club\u2019s top tier, I get a percentage of annual membership fees of all the members in my cohort\u200a\u2014\u200aten directly under me, and the five that each of them manage, and the two that each of those guys manage\u2026160 memberships.Today, every year, I get a pretty sweet payout from my cut of all those membership fees, which each club member must re-up at market rates or sell. FanClub runs a seat auction every year, and members get a discount, but they can also make the seat available for auction and pocket the difference.More Fanchise CashflowsThe Fanchise also gets a cut of other revenue streams, such as ad-dollars from Jeter videos and other content. In the old days, it was hard to negotiate this without putting a new player\u2019s relationship with a signing team in jeopardy, but now it\u2019s pretty standard.In addition to the member fees from the members below us, we get cuts of these other revenues, too.The FanClub Product and Service RegistrySomething important to know about FanClub is that the Fanchise never pays the Star directly. The money we raised to support Derek in the early days was spent via the FanClub Registry. This is a registry of all kinds of vendors, from makers of bats and mits to hotels and transportation companies.So the Star can\u2019t just get a bunch of money from the fanchise and blow it. In fact, nobody can actually touch the money directly, which is why the NCAA today allows fanchises to support young athletes. They can track the money and be confident that the club only covers expenses that don\u2019t violate amateur eligibility rules. FanClub restricts the funds from our membership dues to products and services that can receive direct payment through the club\u2019s blockchain smart contract. And in the early days, that meant we had to reach out to every coach, equipment vendor and hotel we wanted to spend club funds on.The vendors were the easiest, because they were usually small outfits, and the onboarding was easy enough, thanks to OpenLaw. FanClub also provides a bank account to the franchise that is accessible by Ethereum smart contracts, making it possible to really track and verify spending. It\u2019s possible to game the system, but very hard and easy for FanClub to detect.Getting the coaches to get onboarded and agree to take payment by smart contract took some convincing, but most got it within a month or two. The hotels were hardest, but the FanClub global organization helped a lot. Of course, today nobody worries about whether they can pay a vendor by smart contract, but for the first decade or so of FanClub, every club rejoiced when someone managed to get another vendor onto the blockchain, because that meant we all had instant access to them.Vendors wanted to sell stuff to FanClub Stars like Jeter, so it really wasn\u2019t as hard as we thought it would be in the beginning\u2026most of the time. When it was a problem, we\u2019d just select a competitor. The athletic supply industry might not be filled with innovators, but they live on the edge financially and they know word travels, especially among FanClubers.The key was how FanClub made it easy to get on the system and start getting paid. And showing up in the FanClub marketplace was also a big bonus, once fanchises started popping up all over the sports scene and then into all kinds of entertainment.FanClub Over the YearsThe front end application has changed over the years. In \u201990, we had the Internet and blockchain, but mainly AOL. Web browsers were still a few years away, and forget about iPhones. That was the stuff of science fiction. But it never mattered. Different front-ends, even a couple different companies providing the user experience and services like onboarding and oversight, came and went, but because all the club rules, our money, and our history were on the blockchain, we never had to worry about switching or having some new company take over the old provider and messing everything up. In fact, I use a fanclub application called Fantaztic, and I know others prefer Clubz. Doesn\u2019t matter. Everything just works. Yay, \u201cblockchain Internet\u201d!ConsenSys Web3Studio is now into Phase II: MagicBus, which is all about how to use the public Ethereum Mainnet to conduct private, confidential business.

En este blog podr\u00e1n encontrar actualizaciones de nuestro proyecto, Preguntas Frecuentes y piezas destacadas de nuestro equipo y colaboradores invitados.Presentando: PolkadotHemos visto un gran n\u00famero de proyectos de blockchain y criptomoneda alcanzando hitos muy significativos. Algunos son altamente funcionales y abiertos como Ethereum, mientras que otros brindan alta protecci\u00f3n a la privacidad como Zcash. Otros est\u00e1n dise\u00f1ados para cumplir con los requisitos de permisos de empresas y operan en privado.En el futuro, vemos un mundo lleno de diversas blockchains todas sirviendo prop\u00f3sitos espec\u00edficos y \u00fanicos. Actualmente, estas redes blockchain permanecen aisladas sin comunicaci\u00f3n o inter-operabilidad entre ellas; esto es un problema existencial que necesita ser resuelto para que cualquier ecosistema verdaderamente seguro y sin necesidad de garant\u00edas se desarrolle y crezca.Polkadot es una red que conecta blockchains. Con Polkadot, varias blockchains pueden enviar y recibir mensajes entre ellas.Este desarrollo excepcional contribuir\u00e1 a traer a la luz el nuevo ecosistema de Web3. Un mundo en donde las Aplicaciones Descentralizadas (Dapps) pueden hacer uso de muchas blockchains interconectadas. Redes privadas/consorcios, p\u00fablicas/sin permisos y oracles, podr\u00e1n brindar nuevos, novedosos y descentralizados servicios.\u00bfEspera, pero c\u00f3mo?La seguridad es compartida por todo el ecosistema Polkadot, lo cual significa que las cadenas individuales pueden hacer uso de la seguridad colectiva sin tener que comenzar de cero para conseguir tracci\u00f3n y confianza.Polkadot tambi\u00e9n puede mejorar algunos de los problemas de adaptabilidad que se presentan en algunas blockchains aisladas. Llevando a cabo transacciones en paralelo, Polkadot brinda la habilidad de dividir transacciones entre m\u00faltiples parachains (el nombre que se le otorga a las cadenas paralelas que participan de la Polkadot network).Estamos creando una blockchain en la que los poseedores de tokens tienen el completo control sobre el protocolo. Todos los privilegios, que en otras plataformas son exclusivos de los miners, les ser\u00e1n otorgados a los participantes de la relay chain, incluyendo el manejo de eventos excepcionales como upgrades del protocolo y reparaciones.Este es el trabajo que permite que los poseedores de tokens Polkadot imaginen sistemas nuevos completamente libres de los arcaicos modelos dependientes de confianza.

We have only begun to also observe similar emergent behaviours and clues pertaining to the nature of web 3.0 \u2014 especially in respects to how it will foreseeably influence us socially and financially.

Today\u2019s kingmakers are picking horses. The race is on for robust IoT holonic architectures. These must facilitate the plethora of messaging and events required to communicate and adapt based on the flow of data. With both entities (or things) and the interface technologies being diverse and disparate, next-gen networking or Interweaving is clamouring for solutions.At the same time a new breed of analytics models are required, also quality, security, and of course metering and payment solutions to name a few. The market will shape as previous nascent markets have formed. A few large players will emerge and attract an ecosystem of mid-market and SMB players. The difference in IoT is the sheer multiplicity of nodes and node types. Herein are the opportunities for today\u2019s entrepreneurs. The game is speed to market. There is someone in an organization somewhere who has a pay-to-play goal and budget where you might just be their answer. Build what you know is needed.The IoT is about the interactions amongst the participants who can be multivariate in fit, form, function, interface and interoperability. I\u2019m not the most knowledgeable on this topic, but it doesn\u2019t take much study to recognize a long-game play that Intuit would be smart to have on their roadmap. If I were the CMO of Intuit I would be driving an integration play as is evidenced by the purchase of itDuzzit. I would also be looking to cover the acquisition costs, deepen market penetration and expand outside of the current customer base \u2014 all the Marketing 101 stuff. Beyond that, I would be driving a completely future looking agenda to win the accounting needs of the IoT with expansion into metering, billing, reporting and payment while the field is open for play.Not too dissimilar, the funding of IFTTT with eyes on the IoT is more than a leading indicator, the investors are acquiring a stake in an ecosystem during its eminent build out. Responding to messaging and events is a small piece of what is required, so expect to see other complementary services that are poised to be funded, acquired, or spun up. Beyond simple messaging the need and the ability exists to manipulate the data based on complex combinatorial factors. A holarcy formed of such capable holons, themselves characteristically autonomous and cooperative, defines architecture useful for IoT or M2M goals. In a holonic model each entity\u2019s value derives from individuality and uniqueness and the capacity to engage and interact with others.An infrastructure of nodes or holons that are fully capable of adapting and communicating through complex event-based relays coupled with data-centric meta-programming capabilities makes sense for the IoT or M2M alike. We feel like we are working on the right stuff with the long-game clearly in focus.No longer simply nice-to-have, interoperability is demanded for modern apps that are integrations of multiple disparate services and for the Internet of Things and M2M which must facilitate discoverable, addressable and invocable members of the Interweave. Future apps must become self-organizing cohorts of autonomous yet cooperative components and/or things.

My trip ended at Berlin Blockchain Week. Berlin is an incredible city with a values-driven tech community that is focused on changing the world for the better. The crypto community there is no exception (just spend one day at Full Node there and you\u2019ll see).Most of my time in Berlin was spent at the Web3 Summit where the conversation seemed to be dominated by DAOs. Ryan Zurrer unveiled his thinking behind the new DA0, and I was able to participate in a whiteboarding session on this one. There are still many open questions on incentives, regulations (AML is a nightmare when you can\u2019t compromise on open pseudonymous participation), fund flows (anyone want to figure out the tax effects here?), and governance. However, as Zurrer mentioned in his talk, DAOs are worthwhile experiments.We\u2019re creating new systems for the coordination of human and financial capital and it won\u2019t come easy. During my favorite presentation of the week, Juan Benet gave a brilliantly woven and impassioned speech that reminded attendees why we\u2019re working on Web3, but how difficult the road will be.Here are Web3\u2019s values according to Juan and how they manifest in technological development:Freedom of Speech \u2014 secure data publishing and distributionFreedom of Assembly \u2014 secure networking#OwnYourData \u2014 secure data storage and sharingWithout central control \u2014 decentralized connectivity and computationAll interactions are verifiable \u2014 authenticated, provable, irreversible transactionsReader & Writer privacy \u2014 oblivious content routingDependable & trustless \u2014 decentralized incentivized infrastructureSelf sovereign identity for all \u2014 cryptographically controlled identityAfter spending a couple of years investing full time in crypto, I have experienced waves of emotion ranging from excitement to jadedness. The word \u201cscam\u201d is probably the most used word on Crypto Twitter besides Bitcoin, and if you survived the 2017 ICO boom, you\u2019ve probably encountered at least one or two. We\u2019ve seen dozens of teams promoting scalability with sufficient decentralization, but none have yet delivered.To date (as I\u2019ve mentioned before) the killer use case in crypto remains speculation. Centralized exchanges are the new financial gatekeepers, and while #DeFi promises financial inclusion, it\u2019s mostly used for leveraged trading.Naturally, this has led many \u201ccrypto enthusiasts\u201d back to the mother coin, Bitcoin, to join the chorus of maximalists who believe that nothing else under the sun matters.But the truth is that Bitcoin can become a global SoV AND Web3 can exist.As Amara\u2019s Law states, we tend to overestimate the effect of technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run (shoutout to Tom Lombardi on this one).We\u2019re in the thick of it now, stuck in the weeds, and there is admittedly still a lot of bull shit out there. However, thousands of developers, guided by the principles of Web3, are working diligently to solve extremely hard technical problems.At the end of his presentation Juan reminded us that:Crypto systems are HARDP2P systems are HARDEconomic systems are HARDWe\u2019re trying to recreate all three.My visit to Berlin gives me renewed confidence that we will.Note: Juan\u2019s talk is not yet available, but you can watch this one from last year\u2019s Web3 Summit to get the drift.Things to ReadElementus delivered an in-depth analysis of the fund flows from the Plus Token scam that I mentioned last week. According to this report, Plus Token absorbed 10 MILLION ETH (worth $2b at today\u2019s prices).Meanwhile, it looks like some key members of Harbor\u2019s executive team left to start a new company called Internal. This doesn\u2019t seem to bode well for the company once though to be the frontrunner in the STO space. STOs may eventually become a huge market, but I still feel we are years away from finding real product-market fit (or maybe that\u2019s just Amara\u2019s law in action again).Macro uncertainty continues. Existing systems are bending to trade disputes and unprecedented sovereign debt levels. Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, delivered a speech on the challenges of monetary policy in today\u2019s macro environment all but calling for the end of US Dollar hegemony in a global world. I liked this gem from the speech:\u201cWe would do well to think through every opportunity, including those presented by new technologies, to create a more balanced and effective system.\u201dEventsThis WeekSpecial CryptoMondays LA \u2014 ERC 1155 (Free)When: Monday, August 26th, 6\u20139PWhere: Upstairs Space 1212 Restaurant on 3rd Street Promenade in Santa MonicaSpeakers include Jodee Rich (nft.kred) giving an overview of the NFT ecosystem + smart contract developer Kseniya Lifanova on Ethereum token standards + Andy Anderson on the development in EnjinBlockchain for Social Good \u2014 What Can You Trust (Free)When: Tuesday, August 27th, 12\u20132PWhere: Anita\u2019s Studio 6th / Rose Avenue \u00b7 Venice, CADiscuss how blockchain technology can be used for social goodBlockchain Consensus Mechanisms (Free)When: Thursday, August 29th, 7\u20139PWhere: BOLDFACE 1013 1/2 190th Street \u00b7 Gardena , CAOpen discussion on the most commonly used consensus mechanismsBitcoinIs Hosted by NFL Pro Bowler Russell Okung ($75\u2013500)When: Sunday, September 1, 2019,Where: The Hudson Loft, 1200 S Hope St, Los Angeles, CA 90015Hosted by NFL Pro Bowler, Russell Okun, Bitcoin Is_ is a one day conference with the intention of educating and onboarding new Bitcoiners.

Blockweek being a festival of events held in NYC, drawing over 6,500 people in 2019 from around the world to discuss the latest developments of blockchain and web3, and headlined by the Coindesk Consensus Conference.Having attended the 2017 and 2018 NYC blockweeks but not being able to attend 2019, I was eager to learn about how this years event was received by the Melbourne community. This curiosity partly driven by the craziness of last year\u2019s Blockweek as 2018 was an incredible year, highlighting the extremely good and extremely bad aspects of the industry via the fundraising efforts of inspiring entrepreneurs against a backdrop of the peaks of the previous cryptomarket bull run.Alex from Flex Dapps kicking off the eveningWhat I heard from those who attended was Blockweek continues to be a strong indicator of the global state of blockchain and web3 technology. 2018 was dominated by investment pitches and party\u2019s fit for a movie highlighting the extremes of Wall Street affluence. 2019 seems to have been a more sober conference, with a strong focus on regulation and enterprise adoption: a sign that the technology continues to mature and be taken extremely seriously on the global stage.This message was delivered strongly from Simon Harman (Loki) and Prof Jason Potts (RMIT Innovation Hub). According to Simon from Loki, the conference was over represented by government (regulators), corporate firms, and service providers compared to entrepreneurs or those building blockchain or web3 products. Prof Jason Potts took this as an optimistic signal, pointing out that this attendance is a strong indicator of technology maturation and adoption.Overall the message is clear: Blockchain and Web3 technology continues to see extremely strong global uptake. And it\u2019s great to see so many Australian\u2019s front and centre on this technology wave.Well done to the Flex guys (Alex and Tom) who continue to bring the community together in fantastic ways: And well done to those who spoke, including Austrade, Jason Potts, James Simpson, Simon Loki, Bec Martin.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Ethereum"]}, {"title": "A brief release history of the web", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@peteramckay/a-brief-release-history-of-the-web-aeef5bb3b814?source=search_post", "author_name": "Peter A.

McKayFollowMar 12 \u00b7 4 min readSir Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide WebAs an aficionado of Web 3.0 tech, I realize that putting version numbers on the World Wide Web is an inherently arbitrary, somewhat messy undertaking. After all, the web isn\u2019t corporate-owned software like Windows with official release dates, but an open technology with several billion users, developers, and other stakeholders shaping it everyday. That\u2019s the very beauty of it.In that spirit, I\u2019m going to run through a quick timeline below of the web from birth to version 3.0, using just six key dates that I believe defined the (very unofficially) numbered stages so far.Now is a great time to do this, as the web is celebrating its 30th anniversary this week. Plus, a simple chronology may help clarify for newbies what I\u2019m yammering about with all the \u201cWeb 3.0\u201d jazz the rest of the time around here. \u263a\ufe0fHere goes:March 12, 1989: Tim Berners-Lee, a physics researcher at CERN in Switzerland, launches the first web server in order to better share documents with his colleagues. To do this, he creates several new software tools, including a coding system called Hypertext Markup Language to allow research papers to link directly to previous works cited. This is effectively the Big Bang of the Web 1.0 era, which is defined by document sharing. For over a decade to come, people primarily envision the web as a series of \u201cpages\u201d referring to one another.February 1991: America Online ships the first version of its web \u201cportal\u201d software. We\u2019re still squarely in the Web 1.x era here, but this event bears mentioning as a crucial step toward bringing the web to the masses. (Maybe we\u2019ll call it Web 1.3?) Through the \u201990s, AOL and its competitors Prodigy and CompuServe will connect millions of people to the web for the first time, mostly through traditional copper phone lines to their homes and offices.Aug. 9, 1995: Netscape Communications, maker of the popular Navigator web browser, completes its initial public offering of stock, making millions for the company\u2019s early investors. We\u2019re still in the web\u2019s early growth stage here \u2014 let\u2019s call it version 1.6 at this point \u2014 but this IPO is another truly seminal event. Widely regarded around Wall Street as the start of the first \u201cdotcom boom,\u201d the Netscape IPO validated the web as a viable platform to do business at massive scale. It thus paved the way for other wildly popular tech IPOs to come throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, including Google, Amazon, and so on.Aug. 1, 2003: MySpace launches. This marks the start of Web 2.0, defined by people\u2019s use of the web to communicate directly with one another via social networks. Though it\u2019s easy to forget now, this was a pretty radical departure at the time from approaching the web merely as a tool to view relatively inert pages of information. Facebook and other competitors would eventually eclipse MySpace, of course, but history will always have to credit them as the first breakout success of the social era. Also notable: Of all the unofficial web \u201cversions\u201d discussed in this post, the term \u201cWeb 2.0\u201d is by far the most popularly known and accepted, as it\u2019s been widely used in the press over time as shorthand for all things related to social networking.Nov. 12, 2006: New York Times tech reporter John Markoff does a story on Web 3.0 \u2014 the earliest known reference to the term in a popular, global publication. He mentions a budding movement among technologists to adopt things like artificial intelligence and data tools that add semantic meaning to web content.Oct. 31, 2008: A mysterious author (or authors) publishes under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto a whitepaper describing the technology behind bitcoin, which soon after goes into production and becomes a global phenomenon. To me, this is the true start of the Web 3.0 era \u2014 after the proto stage that Markoff ably documented \u2014 as bitcoin brings the concept of decentralization to the fore in a big way. Unlike previous web technologies, which were built to rely heavily upon distinct servers like the one Berners-Lee ran from his desk at CERN all the way back in 1989, bitcoin uses novel encryption techniques to store transaction data for each bitcoin token on a peer-to-peer network. This eventually opens the way for even more full-fledged distributed computers \u2014 like the Ethereum network created by Vitalik Buterin \u2014 that can run entire applications without the use of traditional servers.Of course, decentralization runs counter to the very nature of the web as most of us currently experience it in 2019, dominated by just a few big services like Facebook and Google that increasingly abuse us. That\u2019s why any shift toward decentralization warrants a whole new \u201cversion\u201d number for the web.I believe recent technical advances, coupled with rapidly rising skepticism of Big Tech among consumers, suggest the decentralization trend will run on quite awhile longer. That should lead to more user control of our personal data, greater market competition among companies, more innovation, and other benefits.Which isn\u2019t to say there won\u2019t be more bumps in the road, mind you. There are probably still more privacy scandals to come involving abuse of centrally hosted data \u2014 like this story that Wired just broke about Foursquare.But in general, I\u2019m optimistic as the web turns 30. No, its worst actors haven\u2019t decisively been defeated yet. But momentum is on the side of the users and upstarts.This post originally appeared on Indizr, my blog about Web 3.0.

You don\u2019t know what bootleg is? You must not be living in the near future with the rest of us, where bootlegging has become a major thing. To get up to speed, read the original bootleg story and check out the new bootleg kit.We\u2019d show you the video, but here\u2019s the thing: That\u2019s not how bootleg works. The point of bootleg is digital scarcity. Only three people have access to that concert footage \u2014 the people who paid to be added to the token\u2019s franchisors list: Joe Lubin, Jesse Grushack and one mystery user who now owns the rights to sell a franchise seat to someone else. If they don\u2019t choose to do so, those three people (plus the band and the bootlegger) are the only ones who will ever see the footage of that evening.This \u201clive ammo\u201d test of the Bootleg smart contract made real money for the band, which donated 10% to its charity.The Shared Royalty Non-Fungible TokenBootleg is made possible by a new token framework called the shared royalty non-fungible token (SRNFT), an extension of the ERC721 of Cryptokitties fame. The framework, expected to be submitted as an Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) shortly, adds a franchisor array, a payments array, a royalty distribution interface, and a way for a franchisor to withdraw the percentage of their cut from payments. (For Ethereum smart contract developers, withdrawal is done cleverly to avoid gas limits that could prevent withdrawals under certain conditions.)The SRNFT provides an economic incentive to anyone who has purchased access to the video not to leak it to YouTube or some other public platform, because as a franchisor, you didn\u2019t really buy the video. You bought rights to a percentage of all future payments made when you sell it, and then they sell it, and so on\u2026forever. Leak the video, and you potentially harm your future cashflows.decentralized Off-chain Non-transferability (dONT)The other key component that makes Bootleg work \u2014 still a work in progress and looking for open source contributors \u2014 is dONT, a watermarking and encryption scheme that ensures that if you do leak the video file, it can be identified as your print and nobody else\u2019s.Commercial Interest in BootlegSeveral companies that attended the SXSW event reached out, and at least one music studio is now reportedly in active efforts to use the open source bootleg code to build their own bootleg service. Other organizations are reportedly using the code to develop ventures that do very different things but which rely on the same basic pattern, using the SRNFT or the dONT components to get a leg up on development.Bootleg Can Be Your CompanyThis is yet another example of how ConsenSys, the world\u2019s premier blockchain venture studio, is giving back to the Ethereum and Web3 ecosystem, conceiving audacious ideas, articulating them, and then building the foundation of the code to catalyze them into real ventures.Not only are the codebase and all the ideas behind Bootleg (including the name) completely up for grabs under the most liberal open source license, the leadership of the code repository on GitHub that houses the project is open for anyone to assert leadership of the work and become a maintainer. Contact Web3Studio if you are interested in staking a claim to the Bootleg leadership by serving the community.What\u2019s Next For Bootleg?The Web3Studio team is already onto its next audacious project, called SideJam.

Hydro\u2019s token creation and distribution has been different from most other blockchain projects, as we decided on a much fairer initial distribution through a developer airdrop. In an effort to continue to be as clear and transparent as possible, we have found the need to be more specific with how the entire token supply will be handled in the future.A finite supply of 11,111,111,111 HYDRO Tokens was created during the smart contract creation. For the health and continued sustainability of the Hydro ecosystem, the HYDRO Tokens were allocated as follows:Third-Party Developers: 2,632,330,741.57These are the tokens that were distributed during the initial HYDRO airdrop to developers that met the Hydrogen compliance standards at the time. This distribution is final, and we are not holding any more airdrops.Community Development Program: 1,111,111,111.10The Hydro Community Development Program (HCDP) is Hydrogen\u2019s plan to encourage a decentralized platform with awesome products developed on top, and as many developers contributing to the project as possible. HCDP tokens will be released in small increments over time throughout the lifetime of the Hydro ecosystem to reward development and keep the ecosystem running.Repository: 3,888,888,888.85The token repository currently has no plans for distribution, but in an effort to encourage decentralization, it should be assumed that the tokens will eventually be incrementally distributed into the ecosystem. Some possible ways the tokens in the repository could be distributed are: exchange of tokens with BTC or ETH, additions to HCDP, or additional internal developer allocations. Currently there are no formal plans for any distribution. In the event of a planned distribution from this repository, we will alert the Hydro community with 30 days notice.Current Internal Developer Team: 2,923,222,222.19The use or movement of the team tokens is unlocked after the February 16th, 2018 contract creation and distribution.Future Internal Developer Team: 555,558,147.2Future team tokens are 100% unlocked when allocated.It is important to note that all 11,111,111,111 Hydro tokens were mined during the contract creation and are already stored in ERC-20 wallets. Some token tracking sites will show a much smaller circulating supply than 11,111,111,111. Please note, this does not mean more tokens have been mined or the total supply has increased; the tokens already exist in the wallets, but token tracking sites are quite unsophisticated and they do not treat ERC-20 tokens correctly in our opinion. No HYDRO tokens are locked.Remember, it is the goal of Project Hydro to be decentralized and empower millions of developers and billions of end users to create a self-sustaining ecosystem for the financial betterment of humankind. We believe this token plan serves that end purpose, while successfully fostering the initial incubation of the ecosystem.If you have any other questions about Hydro please feel free to go to Telegram, Discord or Reddit to ask for more information!", "responses": 6, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Hydro", "Ethereum", "Token", "Cryptocurrency"]}, {"title": "EASY AND RELIABLE SHIPPING THROUGH EFFECTIVE BLOCKCHAIN CONTRACTING", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@bitnautic/easy-and-reliable-shipping-through-effective-blockchain-contracting-5346bd4b0f44?source=search_post", "author_name": "BitNautic", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@bitnautic", "publish_date": "2018-04-18", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-16", "readtime": "1.74", "claps": 344, "voters": 217, "content": "EASY AND RELIABLE SHIPPING THROUGH EFFECTIVE BLOCKCHAIN CONTRACTINGBitNauticFollowApr 18, 2018 \u00b7 2 min readIntroducing BitNautic, the Decentralized Shipping Platform for the Web 3.0Shipping industry accounts of around 90% of the value of the World Trade. There are over 50,000 merchant ships, registered in over 150 nations, trading internationally, transporting every kind of cargo. The operation of these ships generates an estimated annual income of over $0.5 trillion in freight rates. This hugely valuable industry has been troubled for years by challenges like:\u2014 Overcapacity,\u2014 Highly variable freight rates,\u2014 Cargo no show, by shippers\u2014 Cargo rolling, by carriers\u2014 Security threats and\u2014 Increasing regulations.At the same time, local producers, charterers and shippers, especially the ones operating from developing countries, are facing several problems when it comes to shipping, like:\u2014 The high number of intermediaries,\u2014 Expensive freight rates,\u2014 Lack of transparency,\u2014 Limited number of sea lines, and\u2014 Difficulties in shipping small cargo.This global inefficiency is estimated to cost the industry more than $23 billion/year (Source: New Jersey Institute of Technology).Reversing these trends presents the industry with tremendous economic potential. BitNautic mission is to disrupt the shipping industry as is today, by creating a disintermediating platform, that will provide massive benefits over traditional shipping:\u2014 Decentralized direct transactions (no middlemen),\u2014 Very low and flat fee 2% (no mark-up from brokers 5%-15%),\u2014 Instant payment (no delayed payment),\u2014 Transparent fixed all-in contracts based on blockchain (no complex/confusing contracts),\u2014 Booking deposit in crypto token governed by smart contracts (to guarantee both parties),\u2014 Online offers with direct terms negotiation (no opaque fares), \u2014 support from independent agents,\u2014 Archival of all relevant documentation,\u2014 A wholesale e-commerce platform to help local producers to export their goods.BitNautic Platform will include the following applications:\u2014 Booking System with Artificial Intelligence Matching and crypto Token Deposit,\u2014 Ship Brokerage System,\u2014 Cargo Consolidation System,\u2014 Tracking System for ships and cargo, Wholesale e-commerce,\u2014 Escrow service.

For people looking for a way to understand Bitcoin, blockchains, and everything else your technology friends and questionable investment advisors are saying, cryptoeconomics is the place to start. Here, you\u2019ll understand how the \u201cblockchain\u201d industry works from the ground up \u2014 not only technically, but via economic incentives.The purpose of this article is to define cryptoeconomics, call out by name some current tools available, and to review some interesting use cases of these designs in live projects. Standing on the shoulders of thinking giants like Kahneman (\u201cThinking Fast And Slow\u201d) and Munger (Mental Models), the goal of the article will be to open up the conversation about the fundamental tools which were used to create Bitcoin, and how they are being re-used and built upon in other blockchains.Furthering cryptoeconomic research is the best way to ensure the community has knowledge of the tools available when designing the next generation of the world wide web. Now is the time to build and iterate on these tools \u2014 when user counts are in millions, not billions (thanks Jeff Coleman, for that thought).A little pre-historyAs the name suggests, \u2018cryptoeconomics\u2019 is a coming together of fields: cryptography, computer science, and economics.CryptographyCryptography evolved from ancient ciphers written by Hebrew scholars, the Spartan military, and other early civilizations. One famous early cipher was the \u2018Caesar Cipher\u2019, where each letter in a string was shifted forward a fixed amount. For example, if the shift is 3, and the letter is \u2018c\u2019, it becomes \u2018f\u2019.In this Caesar Cipher, \u201ccryptography\u201d \u2192 \u201cfubswrjudskb\u201d.This simple example displays the main feature of cryptography: the defender\u2019s advantage. Cryptographic systems are much more difficult to crack than to use. To test: Give your friends \u201cfubswrjudskb\u201d and tell them to figure out what you mean.Today\u2019s cryptographic systems have evolved. It is now the goal of cryptographic systems to be resistant to attack, even if their inner workings are known. While someone could easily figure out \u201cfubswrjudskb\u201d by threatening one person, a cryptographically secure system should stand even if this person (or even, let\u2019s say, 25% of the network) was independently compromised. Such strength leads to disincentives to even bother trying to break the code. Speaking of incentives\u2026Mechanism DesignMechanism design is a field of economics dedicated to the study of mechanisms to (dis)/incentivize actions. If game theory is the study of different possible actions in a game, mechanism design is the study of creating a game.A game designer must consider a) what tools are available to create a game, b) what to incentivize in the game, c) how to learn from these rules, and d) how to iterate along the way. It is the job of the designer of the game to lead to actions which lead to a fair, secure game.To bring this to light, I\u2019ll bring up my favorite game \u2014 basketball.Some of you proud Canadians may know James Naismith. In 1891, Naismith created the thirteen original rules of \u201cbasket ball\u201d. The first game was 9-on-9, no dribbling, 15 minute halves with a five minute break for halftime. The main goal of the game? Make more shots into the peach basket than the other team. The first game ended with a strong score: 1\u20130.\u201cHooping\u201d, circa 1891.The original rules incentivized players to put the ball in the hoop. Players were constrained by their ability to only move the ball by passing. In the original version, 18 basketball players shared physical space, endured athletic strain, and communicated with teammates\u2026all in efforts to to score the basketball and win the game.As time went on, the \u2018beta\u2019 version of basketball has shifted quite a bit. The peach basket was traded for a metal hoop, backboards and nets (read: infrastructure updates). Rules were changed. Dribbling was added, increasing the ability for players to move around the court and adding complexity (and beauty) to the game. Eighteen players on the court was reduced to ten. A three point line was introduced, to add a one-point incentive to players to practice, take, and make long-distance shots. More recently, rules on fouls became more stringent. This update made the role of the defender harder, thereby increasing the scoring in games.Black magic\u2026These \u2018mechanism updates\u2019 have been ways for the NBA to continuously improve the viewer experience and the game itself. The basketball we know has changed based upon changes in the rules of the game. We\u2019ll come to find that designing a blockchain protocol like Bitcoin isn\u2019t too far off from designing the game of basketball.While economics obviously has a long history, the field of mechanism design is rather new \u2014 about 50 years since inception. Only in 2007, a year before Satoshi Nakamoto published the Bitcoin whitepaper, Leonid Hurwicz, Eric Maskin, and Roger Myerson won the Nobel Prize in Economics \u201cfor having laid the foundations of mechanism design theory.\u201d It is an interesting field which I hope to delve into further in the future.Nobel Prize: What is mechanism design and why does it matter?On Monday, Leonid Hurwicz, Eric Maskin and Roger Myerson were awarded the 2007 Nobel Prize in Economics for their\u2026voxeu.orgCryptoeconomicsNow that we have defined \u2018mechanism design\u2019 and \u2018cryptography\u2019 more broadly, we can define cryptoeconomics. And I quote, from Vlad:\u201cCryptoeconomics is the application of incentive mechanism design to information security problems.\u201dCryptoeconomics brings home the idea that through cryptography and properly-aligned incentives, we can secure protocols like Bitcoin and Ethereum.Bitcoin is a dazzling showcase of cryptoeconomics. For the first time, someone answered how to fit together these important, abstract puzzle pieces (tools) in a way that worked to create a digital currency which works.But\u2026we have some learning to do before we get there. First, the cryptographic primitives. Then, how they work together in Bitcoin.Cryptographic PrimitivesCryptographic primitives are judged on their ability to achieve three qualities:Authenticity: The message truly came from the stated senderConfidentiality: Private data remained so during the transfer processIntegrity: Data (public or private) was unchangedA good example, modified slightly from a good Stack Overflow answer:Suppose Alice and Bob are talking to each other. Authenticity would mean that messages received by Alice are actually sent by Bob. Integrity means that on the route from Bob to Alice, the message has not changed in between.In general, authenticity would imply integrity but integrity wouldn't imply authenticity. For example, the message may retain its integrity but it could have been sent by Mallory instead of Bob.[Added by me]: Confidentiality holds that private information of both Alice and Bob remained so throughout the process.We\u2019ll start with the primitives which allow Bitcoin to work, which have been around for decades.Cryptographic HashesA cryptographic hash takes an input (like \u201chello\u201d) and turns it into a complex, hard-to-recreate output (like 2cf24dba5f0a30e26e83b2ac5b9e9e1b161e5c1f984, but longer). To test yourself, type in \u2018hello\u2019 and then \u2018hello\u2026\u2019 at this link. Almost as big of a difference as receiving \u2018hello\u2019 vs. \u2018hello\u2026\u2019 from a significant other.The hash is easy to verify if you know the input. If you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re looking for, it won\u2019t be easy to find \u2014 even with the help of a large computer. In computer science, this is called a one-way function, and underlies security of many systems we use today.A one-way function is easy to compute on every input, but hard to invert given the image of a random input.There are many types of cryptographic hashes, dubbed the Swiss-army knife of cryptography for their varied use in the field. The example above is a \u2018SHA-256' hash \u2014 our first Bitcoin cryptographic primitive.Digital SignatureA digital signature is cryptographic proof that the person who signed off on the transaction was really the person it claims to be. Similar to our real-life signatures (formally known as scribble-scrabble), signatures should be unforgeable.Public-key cryptography is how this is done. Each actor, Alice and Bob (get used to these homies) both have a public key \u2014 which is used to share their account address with the world \u2014 and a secret (private) key.The three important algorithms are a) generating a public-private key pair, b) signing with a private key and c) verification to prove a transaction.From Arvind Narayanan\u2019s seminal book, \u2018Bitcoin & Cryptocurrencies\u2019An example would be Alice sending $10 to Bob. To do so, she sends her digital signature (a combo of the $10 message + her private key) to his public key.When Bob receives the message, Alice\u2019s signature is cross-referenced to her public key. If a match is verified, the $10 exchanges hands.Designing BitcoinWith hashes and digital signatures alone, it is possible for a transaction to be made and securely sent from one party to the next. We\u2019re building something here...From Satoshi\u2019s Bitcoin White PaperFrom here, computer science \u2014 linked lists and Merkle trees \u2014 help organize these transactions neatly into \u2018blocks\u2019, and links them together to form a blockchain. The same ability to \u2018hash\u2019 information comes in handy here: each block is represented by a hash, which ties it to the next block. The fact that the hash changes drastically with even the tiniest data modification allows us to check (very easily) whether data has been changed.Now that we see the primitives from both cryptography and computer science which allow for a blockchain to function, let\u2019s see how economics brings this model home.The Game Inside The Game: Proof-Of-Work ConsensusSatoshi, the Bitcoin creator, had to create a way for every computer in the Bitcoin network to agree on the transaction history in this ledger. He also had to decide how to introduce new bitcoin into the network. Eloquently, \u2018proof-of-work\u2019 (repurposed from Hashcash) accomplishes both of these goals.Proof-of-work uses the primitives above \u2014 leaning heavily on hashes (+ nonces) \u2014 to create a game for all the computers on Bitcoin\u2019s network. The game creates a) competition for the chance to add the next block to the Bitcoin blockchain and b) provides an economic incentive for the block proposed to hold accurate transactions.The competition starts with using your computer power to solve an incredibly difficult math problem, where the goal is to find a hash smaller than the target difficulty. To solve the puzzle, there\u2019s not much your computer can do but iterate through millions of hashes per second to get to the answer. While your computer plays this game, all the computers are playing, too. Collectively, these computers are the Bitcoin \u2018miners\u2019, working for digital gold (bitcoin).If the miner wins the race, then their block is valid, and can be sent around to other miners. The winning miner has a great chance at winning a reward \u2014 x bitcoin (12.5 bitcoin, in 2017 \u2014 worth ~$75,000)! To get this reward, however, your block should only include valid transactions: no funny business. If you propose even one transaction in the block which is invalid, it\u2019s likely your block will not make it onto the main Bitcoin blockchain because no one wants to build on an invalid block. This means no more bitcoin for you\u2026 and who knows when you\u2019ll get your next chance? You are thus strongly incentivized to have a honest, accurate block. The miners incentive to be honest makes the Bitcoin network move forward truthfully and honestly.Monetary SupplyEvery 210,000 blocks, the bitcoin reward for mining and proposing accurate blocks halves. Satoshi and team also decided that 21 million bitcoin would be the total supply for the currency.Bitcoin Block Reward Halving CountdownBitcoin Block Reward Halving Countdown websitewww.bitcoinblockhalf.comThis decision, as with others, comes with tradeoffs. Bitcoin that are lost \u2014 are simply lost, deflating the currency slowly, long-term. Ethereum, a protocol with a different goal than bitcoin \u2014 decided on a disinflationary monetary base which adds Ether to the system every year, but slightly less year-over-year. Joseph Lubin explains their thought-process in an early Ethereum blog post:One of Bitcoin\u2019s great value propositions (is) the algorithmically fixed total issuance of the currency which mandated that only 21,000,000 BTC will ever be created. In a time of profligate legacy currency printing in an exponentially doomed attempt to patch over the fact that there is too much debt in the global economic system (with more debt), the prospect of a universally accepted cryptocurrency that can serve eventually as a relatively stable store of value is attractive. Ethereum recognizes this and seeks to emulate this core value proposition.Ethereum also recognizes that a system intended to serve as a distributed, consensus-based application platform for global economic and social systems, must strongly emphasize inclusiveness. One of the many ways we intend to foster inclusiveness is by maintaining an issuance system which possesses some churn. New participants in the system will be able to purchase new ETH or mine for new ETH whether they are living in the year 2015 or 2115. We believe we have a achieved a good balance between the two goals of fostering inclusiveness and maintaining a stable store of value.Mining is not in Ethereum\u2019s long-term vision anymore, but the original choice to increase monetary supply (slower and slower) remains, as an example. All in a day\u2019s work designing an game\u2026Economic CostsThe competition aspect of mining proves to be important for security reasons, as well. It makes the system expensive to attack. To effectively \u2018take-over\u2019, an attacker would need to buy enough equipment and take on enough electricity costs to control more than 51% of the network. See what a cost of a 51% attack would be, today (over $3 billion).Cost of a 51% attack \u2014 GoBitcoinCalculation of the cost of a 51% attack on the Bitcoin networkgobitcoin.ioNote that some miners already are close to spending $3 billion, so this may not be as infallible as we want it to be, ideally. Along with this monetary baseline, there are additional lines of defense against an attacker.A Giant Book Of TransactionsThe net result is a giant book, maintained by the global community \u2014 where everyone is in agreement on the state of transaction history (thanks Naval, for this analogy). This book tells the \u2018story of money\u2019 in a non-tamperable way.Why is this important? Because today\u2019s money is also a story, which we trust to be non-tamperable due to the trust we have in our governments \u2014 who issue and control the money. These governments have done a good job in a lot of cases. In other cases, perhaps less so.The Next Generation Of GamesThe Bitcoin game was the first of many blockchain based games. Ethereum came along in 2014 and is at the forefront of many cryptoeconomic \u2018updates\u2019, including Proof-of-Stake consensus, sharding, and state channels. If you\u2019re excited about cryptoeconomics, here is Cryptoeconomics 307 from Vitalik, co-founder of Ethereum.Ethereum and Bitcoin are base-layer protocols (games), both still tinkering with cryptoeconomics to find what\u2019s right. Lots of tools are being built (Plasma, Lightning, 0x Protocol) to directly affect and surround this base-layer. People are also building tokens on top with cryptoeconomic incentives. Many are early, given the work still to do on the ground level \u2014 but some will be right on time. There is lots of work to be done, starting here.ethereum/researchContribute to Ethereum research development.github.comIn Ender\u2019s Game, the protagonist, Ender, plays \u2018a game\u2019 which turns out to massively shape reality. As with all great sci-fi, this has already shown to be a true story in reality.Cryptoeconomics is helping us create games which lean on the (semi)rationality of man + security provided by computers. For those who protect the rules of the game, rewards are given. For attackers, large financial walls are put up to disincentivize bad behavior. For every bad actor out there \u2014 we remember, cryptography helps us heavily favor the defender.In future posts, we\u2019ll explore cryptoeconomics in new protocols, and dive deep into novel research. Ideally, we find novel ways to use old, tested economics and cryptography in new, interesting ways. Diving deeper into well designed economic systems of the past and learning quickly from the first applications here will be important.The future of blockchain universe is being built today. It\u2019s possible these systems, one-day, will seem as entrenched as the Federal Reserve does today. There will come a time where a future group sits down, looks at the work done around 2017, and asks questions about the implications of our decisions on how money and information flows. It\u2019s better to make mistakes now, before we reach a critical mass.For a growing group, cryptoeconomics seems like the right place to focus attention, as a result. All viewpoints and ideas are helpful at this stage \u2014 the more divergent thoughts, the better. Hopefully, this article gives you footing to be a part of the ride.Thanks to L4 Ventures founders Josh Stark and Jeff Coleman for the inspiration for this post, as well as Nate Rush, Adi Kancherla, and Connor Davis for their early feedback.About the author: Vivek Singh started Kryptos Studio to share thoughts on cryptoeconomics and to highlight projects and thinkers working on the blockchain.

While the wallet system is still in its early stages, we have started to integrate an ID and persona construct across all of our dApps. Soon a uPort persona will enable access to any dApp ConsenSys or other developers build. ConsenSys has begun efforts to work with various partners towards standardization of these components.Since all data on the blockchain is public, the identity of the user in their uPort is determined by their public/private key pairs that give them access to certain information. This perspective, and the sharing permissions of other addresses, determines what users will see in their uPort dashboard, generating a unique viewpoint for every user. In many ways uPort and other wallet systems will replace the browser for the next generation Internet, enabled by distributed technologies like Ethereum.At this first MVP stage of uPort we can think of Personas as an Ethereum- based version of services like keybase or onename. It will associate an Ethereum Address with a Name and Profile Picture, and potentially other info like email address, Twitter handle, etc., in order to map an identity to various attributes. (At first we will start with Name and Picture, but we intend to follow the Blockchain ID spec for other data). This first stage of Persona is primarily visual, as it allows us to replace an address with a Persona badge showing a Name and Picture.The second stage of Persona will focus on having a Persona Identifier, which means even if the user loses their private keys or has their private keys compromised, they will be able to restore their persona. A \u201cmultisig\u201d system will enable this, where each persona can select 2 delegates. In the event that one loses control over the key(s) controlling the Persona, these delegates can reset the keys to bring the persona back in control.This will also enable a persistent reputation attached to that Persona, that can attributed and understood in a variety of contexts. Keep tuned for future posts on our reputation system.Technically what is uPort?We\u2019ve created an initial MVP of Persona contracts. The contract containsThe address that created the contract \u2014 this is the Persona IdentifierThe name of the Persona (in IPFS)*The profile picture (Avatar) of the Persona (in IPFS)We have a bare-bones website where people can create a web-based wallet and use this to create a Persona on the ConsenSys testnet, and get back the address of the contract. We are using a testnet faucet, as well as a simple registry, to map the user\u2019s address to the contract address of their Persona.*The reason we are using IPFS to store data is that when we start adding more data it will be too much to store on the blockchain, and already with a profile picture it\u2019s already too much if the picture is large. For the information in IPFS we are following the BlockchainID specification (v0.2) here.Next UX/UI steps:skin a \u201cpersona\u201d module home page which gives a light intro to what a user is about to do when they create a persona, and what a persona can do (essentially Christian\u2019s demo).Placeholder for \u201cuPort\u201d, a persona \u201cdashboard\u201d: begin mockups of a potential interface for the management of multiple personas.These ideas are still being formed and digital identity/persona is a vast project. Some open questions include:What\u2019s the schematic relationship between a user, their \u201cdashboard\u201d, and their various personas?What\u2019s the best way of packaging the Persona functionality up into a module that can be easily used in different Dapps? Dapp developers should ideally not have to worry about low-level IPFS details for instance.This was written by Christian Lundkvist, Lead Product Developer at uPort.

This shift will not only happen at the services level but also at the Internet infrastructure level. Currently, large telecom companies such as Comcast and Time Warner build the infrastructure to relay Internet data, and they bill their customers every month to maintain that infrastructure. We built Skywire to enable a decentralized Internet both on the infrastructure and application level.Skywire, our flagship application, will ultimately be a community-owned Internet.The idea is that people will run their own Internet infrastructure, including the hardware and the antennas. They are going to start building out a new network to replace the current Internet monopolies like Comcast.An Incentivized Mesh-Internet & Closed-Loop EconomyWe often get the questions: \u201cWhy are people going to pay for these nodes?\u201d or \u201cWhy are they going to share their Internet with their neighbor?\u201d or \u201cWhy are they going to use these decentralized applications?\u201d. The answer is simple, people will get paid to do so.On the Skywire network, if you provide network services such as bandwidth, data storage or computation, you will receive coins. If you are using those resources from other people in the network, then you will spend coins for those resources. This makes Skywire a functional closed-loop economy and a sustainable ecosystem.Mesh-networking is already an established technology with extensive real-world applications. An example is the Guifi open access network, which has about 33 000 active nodes. Skywire is based on Guifi but written from the ground-up with several networking improvements. What sets Skywire apart and what will make it grow exponentially is the monetary incentive that users will receive.This incentive layer is achieved by integrating our blockchain technology, Skycoin, which works in symbiosis with the mesh-net hardware.The Skywire protocol and the Skycoin blockchain both run on our hardware platform, the Skyminer. This means that Skycoin transactions can be forwarded peer-to-peer on the mesh-network, completely bypassing ISPs and governments, making Skycoin the only cryptocurrency that is impossible to block by a malicious third party.Skywire is going to be the first application of blockchain in the real world with day-to-day use.Skywire is going to be the first application that makes blockchain mainstream, where people can actually see antennae on people\u2019s rooftops. People will be able to track how much bandwidth they are producing and how much bandwidth they are consuming. People will see all the use-cases of Skywire with its encrypted messaging and file sharing. If people have excess computation power, they will be able to rent it to the network. They will be able to run a hardware-VPN.We are producing different applications for different verticals and the goal is always to get as many people as we can onto the platform, using Skywire, Skycoin and the ecosystem in their daily lives.Skycoin Fiber PlatformIn addition to Skywire, we see a lot of platform growth coming in companies launching their own blockchains and blockchain applications using our Fiber architecture. We already have 30 companies in the process of launching coins on our Skycoin platform.The benefits for companies launching their projects on Fiber is that they immediately get access to all the innovation we have put into Skycoin thus far. Companies launching on Fiber receive their own blockchain that they own and control, a blockchain that is compatible with our programming language CX, a dedicated hardware platform to run their blockchain, as well as mobile, desktop and hardware wallets.We have also developed support for non-fungible assets on the blockchain, enabling companies to offer blockchain-based gift cards and coupons. We have a compatible point-of-sale system in development, which is very attractive to businesses that want to start exploring blockchain as they receive a fully vertically-integrated solution. To promote this solution, we are going to do regular meet-ups and CX hackathons.Comprehensive Platforms Over App CoinsWe believe that the third generation of blockchain is going to be dominated by comprehensive platforms and we will see fewer single-purpose \u201capp coins\u201d. In its first generation, every blockchain was written from scratch. The second generation allowed quick issuing of tokens (i.e. ERC-20) which allowed ICOs to do rapid fundraising. In the third generation of blockchain, companies will receive their own vertically integrated blockchain solution with all the benefits mentioned above without needing to do any programming.Further, we are working on projects that will allow timeshares, mining rights, futures securities, derivatives, and electricity metering to be conducted on Fiber.There are several benefits to companies receiving their own blockchain. One is control, to be able to roll it back in case of hacks or bugs. It will also be much more cost-effective. Launching a smart-contract on NEO costs 500 GAS (currently $7760). There are no transaction fees on our platform.We have four companies implementing Fiber for blockchain power grids. We are building blockchain power meters for these companies. These companies want people who produce electricity to receive coins and people who consume electricity to pay in coins. This is similar to the closed-loop economic model we are using for Skywire.We are really focusing on both the technological and the economic aspects of blockchain by building sustainable closed-loop economies within a blockchain ecosystem.", "responses": 1, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Skycoin", "Cryptocurrency", "Bitcoin", "Net Neutrality"]}, {"title": "Products as Portals: Designing dApps for Communities", "post_link": "https://media.consensys.net/products-as-portals-designing-dapps-for-communities-a103dd16205e?source=search_post", "author_name": "Sarah Baker Mills", "author_link": "https://media.consensys.net/@starsoup7", "publish_date": "2018-07-26", "last_modified_date": "2018-07-26", "readtime": "4.32", "claps": 285, "voters": 44, "content": "Products as Portals: Designing dApps for CommunitiesBlockchain designer Andrea (Andy) Morales analyzes Web 3.0 UX and shares some predictions and pro tips.Sarah Baker MillsFollowJul 26, 2018 \u00b7 5 min read\u201cIn the crypto space, designers get a seat at the dev table.\u201d \u2013Andy Morales, Senior Design Strategist at the Cryptosystem Productization LabHow did you get involved in blockchain?In 2014, I came to the U.S. on a scholarship to study a Master\u2019s in Transdisciplinary Design at Parsons. I had always been interested in technology, games, and economics, and had even worked in the first two areas in Costa Rica, but it wasn\u2019t until I started working on my Master\u2019s thesis that I realized I could mix the three disciplines.My initial instinct was to design new ways to lessen the influence of intermediaries like Steam, since I was already noticing that my game designer friends were having a hard time dealing with the lack of scarcity in digital economies. Their games would always have to be priced at 1 or 2 dollars, because there was no scarcity in distributing platforms for games. I even started a project called Following the Green Light, but that quickly came to a halt when my professors at Parsons asked me if I\u2019d be interested in going one step further by exploring the design of money and value themselves. That kickstarted my journey down the crypto rabbit-hole, and by 2015 I was deeply entrenched in crypto-communities that were full of artists, theorists, and economists, like MoneyLab or Nettime.My thesis, called I Owe Us, ended up being about the creation of a decentralized local currency infrastructure for the community of the Berkshires. It included physical objects that could compete with credit cards and cash registers, and a game for people to visualize their local economy as a community.A set of rapid wireframes for Delphi, a decentralized adjudication platform, designed by Andrea in collaboration with Yunyun Chen.What are you working on now?I am the Senior Design Strategist at the Cryptosystem Productization Lab. Our mission is to move beyond theory and discover the limits and real properties of novel cryptosystems by observing them in production, and using that data to improve them through design and engineering. I think it\u2019s a great fit for me as it\u2019s a lab with experimental ambitions and a rapid-prototyping flare.We currently have two products in the works and one that has already launched. All of them are Token Curated Registries, but we might begin production of other cryptosystems in the future. As a design strategist, I\u2019ve had my hand in product ownership, strategy, research, rapid prototyping, and UX/UI. Too many hats, but all of them enjoyable.A user persona in the making during a workshop facilitated by Andrea. This workshop was part of the initial strategy sessions of a product for the Cryptosystems Productization Lab.What do you enjoy about designing in the blockchain space?It\u2019s a space where hybrid designers are welcome and encouraged. Since the scene is moving so fast, you have to mix and match different influences in design at breakneck speed to bring something new to the space. That can be stressful, or it can be a huge opportunity, since you\u2019re empowered to be creative, bring new ideas, and put them to the test.Also, because the interest in user-centeredness is still nascent, designers get a seat at the dev table in ways that I hadn\u2019t experienced during my consulting years. People will actively listen to what you have to say. It\u2019s refreshing.A \u201cCryptoeconomic Divination Deck\u201d, inspired by the tarot, designed by Andrea to facilitate the creation of primitives from a user-centered POV.What are some of the challenges you face when designing for users of decentralized apps?Over the past few months, I\u2019ve been pondering how to accelerate user adoption, and what appropriate community management looks like in dApps. I tend to see our products as portals into a broader ecosystem of ConsenSys tools, and we are just beginning to find out how to best introduce users to the big world of Ethereum. That foray could and should involve designers in the creation of the cryptosystem itself so that it\u2019s friendly to users\u2019 initial needs. A Web3 onramp should be designed around continuous community engagement in order to foster a healthy micro-economy.\u201cLook at dApps as windows into communities with their own economies.\u201dThe biggest challenge right now, then, is to look at dApps as windows into communities with their own economies. We should be designing with this mindset, and my prediction is that game design and community organizing will be big influences in our work as designers for dApps.What advice do you have for a designer new to blockchain?Don\u2019t get caught up in the incredibly fast production cycles that this field incentivizes, or in the newfound power that designers are given as torch-bearers for the users of dApps.Keep up with all the commits and pull requests, and produce quickly, but surround yourself with others who can act as checks and balances to this speed. Remember that good strategy is good design, and you\u2019ll probably have to put on your strategist hat on more than you think. Take a breath.Finally\u2013\u2013without meaning to be cheesy\u2013\u2013with great power comes great responsibility. Developers will look to you to bring the user\u2019s voice to the table, but that doesn\u2019t mean that you are yourself the user. Research in parallel to your work, and include your users as much as you can in your process. Also, get caught up with systems thinking: there\u2019s a lot in there that dApp designers will need when designing for a decentralized technology.A workshop Andrea facilitated for the creation of Delphi.

It was slow, there was no streaming, and downloading a song could take more than a day. As the technology evolved, new developer tools and faster internet speeds created the possibility of interactive content on the internet. This led to \u2018web 2.0,\u2019 where individuals could upload content and websites could incorporate interactive and participatory aspects (e.g. Youtube, Wikipedia, Flickr and Facebook). Now people are talking about the arrival of web 3.0, which will involve the decentralization of the internet through the use of blockchain.Bitcoin introduced into the cultural imagination the notion of a distributed ledger, or blockchain, for peer-to-peer digital storage. The decentralized aspect of the technology leads people to see it as the future of the internet. As a peer-to-peer platform, blockchain offers a much fairer and efficient means for users to create, store, and distribute content. For instance, there is no need for centralized platforms like Netflix that charge creators and users. Blockchain platforms like TRON are free and offer a fully open network that is not controlled by large corporations but by those who populate the marketplace. In what follows, I focus on TRON\u2019s contributions in this regard, because I see TRON as being on the cutting edge of the shift to web 3.0.TRON and the 3.0 RevolutionTRON is a blockchain-based protocol dedicated to creating a decentralized and free Internet. This is a bold mission. The fact TRON is a non-profit organization is not incidental. The TRON Foundation\u2019s purpose is providing services to help humanity and advance the social good. This overarching purpose links all aspects of the TRON network.The TRON protocol is already one of the largest blockchain based operating systems in the world. On the TRON protocol, data are unrestricted and free. Users can publish, store, and control how to distribute data without limits. This reflects TRON\u2019s core belief that users who create data should always have fundamental ownership of the data.The TRON network also provides mechanisms for fairly allocating the value of user-generated content. With web 2.0, profits are reaped by corporate entities and distributed to a small group of shareholders. With TRON, anyone who contributes content is entitled to profits of proportional value. Instead of extracting value from users, therefore, the TRON Protocol fairly distributes value to users so a content ecology can evolve.Project AtlasIn July 2018 TRON acquired BitTorrent, the most massive peer-to-peer file sharing protocol in the world. More than anything else, this move put TRON at the forefront of the web 3.0 revolution. The BitTorrent protocol is agnostic, which means it can be used to share and exchange any type of file. This is in part why BitTorrent currently has over 100+ million users and makes up 33% of the total internet traffic. The plan is to combine the TRON blockchain network and BitTorrent P2P network to create an infrastructure for a genuinely decentralized content distribution platform (i.e. an Internet) for a global user base. This partnership between TRON and BitTorrent has been dubbed \u2018Project Atlas.\u2019 Project Atlas exemplifies the core values of the TRON Foundation\u2019s vision for a better world.Buy TRX and BTT on Binance or KucoinHow Will it Work?The vision for Project Atlas is ambitious. The TRON network will infuse the torrent ecosystem with storage and bandwidth, increasing the number of high availability and long torrent lifetimes. And while BitTorrent has always had an incentive model built in \u2014 users who upload faster can download more quickly \u2014 with TRON\u2019s expertise BitTorrent will now compensate users with TRX tokens for participating and contributing. Users can, in turn, use TRX to access special features. For instance, you will have the option to get faster downloads by bidding with TRX tokens. BitTorrent peers will also be able to offer TRX as an incentive to other users to run clients on faster networks and to seed torrents for more extended periods of time. Below are some key features of Project Atlas that I think are especially important in the context of Web 3.0Backwards CompatibilityProject Atlas will be implemented through backward-compatible protocol extensions. Without getting into technical details, this effectively means two things. 1) Users will be completely free to keep using the existing version of BitTorrent if they prefer. BitTorrent will stay free and open to everyone. Any added features, like earning or spending TRX, will not be mandatory and users will still be able to download and seed to/from those who are taking advantage of Project Atlas\u2019 full potential. 2) Project Atlas can be implemented gradually without changing the BitTorrent user experience. Yet, behind the scenes, the framework connecting users with digital services will be markedly different. Since the implementation of Project Atlas is gradual, the transition from web 2.0 to 3.0 will be smooth for users.Global Democratic ConsensusTRON has chosen to use a delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) system and with Project Atlas. Simply, DPoS means Project Atlas has no interest in mining on users\u2019 computers. Mining is the process that some cryptocurrencies, e.g. Bitcoin, use for verification. It\u2019s called \u201cproof of work\u201d (PoW). By design, PoW requires an enormous amount of computational and electrical energy. Multiple miners or mining pools compete to solve an algorithm but only the first to solve it gets rewarded. Thus, the need for high computational power is built into PoW blockchains.In contrast, Proof of Stake (PoS) doesn\u2019t require repetitive computations. It replaces miners with validators who lock their coins as a stake. Validators take turns voting on blocks with the weight of each one\u2019s vote depending on the size of its stake. When the validators discover a block that can be added to the blockchain, they will validate it by placing a bet on it. Validators are rewarded proportionately to their bets.Building on DoS, TRON has developed an innovative Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) validation method. A DPoS system uses a real-time voting procedure to achieve consensus. Community members vote for the \u2018super representatives\u2019 who will validate transactions and secure the network. The voting in DPoS is on-going, so if a super representative does not perform well, the community can remove their votes, essentially firing them. This is in contrast to the free-for-all miner approach of PoW or the PoS approach where anyone holding enough of the base currency can become a validator.The choice of DPoS for Project Atlas fits clearly with TRON\u2019s overall purpose of creating a decentralized Internet to improve people\u2019s lives. The reason is simple: community members have governance rights. DPoS allows for a democratic, self-governing community with free elections.Content Aligns with Goal\u201cProject Atlas is the foundation for a new way of content distribution. To start, the product will feature faster downloads, more seeds, no mining, and backward compatibility. It is adapted to the world we live in today: mobile, connected, and transparent. We aim to eventually empower all content creators and their communities by eliminating the middleman and enabling content creators to distribute directly to users.\u201d Justin Sun, founder and CEO of TRONJustin Sun\u2019s statement captures much of TRON\u2019s core philosophy as manifested in Project Atlas. However, that philosophy is equally evident in other things TRON is doing to support content creators and users accessing its network. For instance, TRON is creating developer tools to make working with its network easier. Recently it announced TRONGRID, which is a tool that provides a temporary node for developers and also allows developers to keep track of the usage of their smart contract. Also, a newly created depository will offer knowledge and support to developers joining TRON.TRON is also working to make TRX as accessible as possible to as many people as possible. It recently announced partnerships with several large exchanges, (e.g. Bittrex, Bitfinex, Exmo, Yobit, Bitbay, Bitflip) around the world to create TRX/USD trading pairs. These are all exchanges that provide a mobile experience and support people who just got into cryptocurrency or who are located in developing countries. These exchange partnerships mean people all over the world will be able to buy TRX more efficiently using their mobile phones.ConclusionMore than just a technological solution, Project Atlas offers a hopeful vision of humanity\u2019s future. The TRON network\u2019s consensus method is more environmentally sustainable and the use of DPoS adds a new democratic dimension to the operation of the Internet as we know it. The partnership between TRON and BitTorrent also connects two worlds \u2014 China and the United States \u2014 and this cultural exchange is vital to the TRON Foundation. It sees Project Atlas as an example of culture sharing that fits with the decentralized nature of web 3.0.There is no doubt the move to web 3.0 will change everything about how we interact online. Even though it will take time and integration with existing online systems, the wheels of this change have already been set in motion. With Project Atlas, TRON stands at the front of the train.Buy TRX and BTT on Binance or KucoinSubscribe to my Medium and Twitter channels if you want to learn more about blockchain and cryptocurrency projects.

Opera\u2019s Crypto Wallet already supports ETH and ERC tokens.The decision to add another major blockchain onto its platform, marks a further step in Opera\u2019s strategy to make Web 3 more inclusive and user-friendly for people around the world. The integration of the TRON tokens within Opera\u2019s Crypto Wallet will allow hundreds of millions of Opera users to play TRON games and access TRON dApps within the browser. The seamless user interface doesn\u2019t require any third party browser extensions or wallet applications.\u201cTRON is a popular, quickly developing blockchain with a swiftly growing dApp ecosystem. We are happy to open our browser to it, \u201d said Krystian Kolondra, EVP at Opera, Head of Browsers. \u201cBy opening products to multiple blockchains, we are accelerating the mainstream adoption of Web 3.\u201d\u201cWe are excited that Opera, a mainstream browser with hundreds of millions of users, will now seamlessly support TRX and other TRON tokens,\u201d said Justin Sun CEO of TRON.\u201dSoon, Opera users will be able to use dApps on the TRON blockchain. \u201cIn December 2018, Opera became the first major Android browser to include a native Crypto Wallet and Web 3 explorer. These new features let people make transactions and interact with the blockchain-based internet of the future, also known as Web 3. In April 2019, this functionality was introduced to Opera\u2019s PC browser. The iOS version is currently in beta stage and will be released later this year.In late 2018, TRON announced TRON Arcade, a 100 million USD fund dedicated to game applications. There are now more than 400 dApps built on the TRON blockchain, according to the review site dappreview. Many of these have entertainment-related use cases. TRON currently has more than 2.7M TRX accounts and boasts approximately 3M transactions in the span of 24 hours.Opera is the browser of choice for more than 300 million users around the world. The company\u2019s decision to integrate a new blockchain into its browser marks a step to develop future-oriented applications, which talk to as many blockchains as possible, providing the most seamless experience to the users.Opera plans to add support for multiple blockchains within the next 12 months. After the integration of the TRON blockchain, Opera users will be able to use TRON\u2019s TRX and TRC standard tokens within its browser. Opera\u2019s Crypto Wallet already supports ETH and ERC-20 tokens.The Opera browser with crypto wallet and Web 3 support is available for Android smartphones, Windows and Linux PCs and Mac. The wallet is also available in the early access program for Opera Touch for iOS. Currently the browser supports Ethereum, but TRON support will arrive soon. In September 2018, Opera sealed a strategic partnership with Ledger Capital to grow its blockchain technology initiative. Ledger Capital played an instrumental role in establishing Opera\u2019s partnership with TRON.About OperaFounded in 1995 in Norway, Opera delivers browsers and AI-driven digital content discovery solutions to more than 320 million people worldwide.

But also in the area of services and resources, linking them directly to consumers, with projects like Golem Project, SONM, Kauri Team, Swarm, Storj Labs, Pangea, and many others.The Internet is also broken, according to Lubin, because \u201cit didn\u2019t ever had a native identity construct\u201d or a \u201cnative money construct too.\u201dHe mentioned what ConsenSys calls self-sovereign identity (uPort), a blockchain-based identity that can serve as the root of our identity. \u201cIt enables you instead of spreading away aspects of your identity across the Internet, having those elements monetized \u2014 he said \u2014 and it enables you to upload your data, in encrypted form, and control all of that information from your side of the browser.\u201dThis way of thinking about identity is going to: enable users to benefit better from their data; enable corporations to have proper, paid-for access to data on data markets.I think the decentralized World Wide Web is going to be much less exploitative of personal information,\u201d he pointed out while mentioning that situations like the Cambridge Analytica scandal and policy paths initiated by regulators like the European Commission\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) are going to push this idea into prominence.This constitute Web 3.0 for ConsenSys and its mesh of projects, with trusted transactions, automated agreements, and smart software objects on Ethereum, a single world computer, a single execution space; as well as other protocols like decentralized storage, decentralized bandwidth, and heavy compute.All of this is going to enable us as people and corporation to interoperate much more fluidly.In a way, Web 3.0 brings the Internet back to its beginning as a decentralized architecture.\u201cBut efficiencies and drive for wealth led to siloed, walled gardens,\u201d Lubin highlighted in a slide. \u201cThis was due to a lack of mechanism for shared ownership of open platforms.\u201dWeb 3.0 is what we\u2019re just of the cusp of. And Web 4.0 is going to be very interesting.Lubin mentioned how Web 4.0 is \u201cwhat we\u2019re just starting to think about.\u201d It is a system where artificial intelligent agents are empowered by value through blockchain and tokens. \u201cThe Internet of the machines economy is going to be very interesting and definitely coming to a blockchain near you,\u201d he said.When is this going to happen? Hard to say, but here are a few historical points that Lubin mentioned:Tim Berners-Lee invented the WWW in 1989;It took about 10 years to ramify it for consumers;We\u2019re now about 5 years into the decentralized web or Web 3.0\u201cIt feels it\u2019s coming really fast, but it also feels it\u2019s agonizingly slow,\u201d Lubin said. \u201cWe\u2019re not seeing the compelling consumer applications, although on the enterprise side we\u2019re seeing things gain real traction. These little elements are all being built and being matured.\u201dEssentially, in 1\u20132\u20133 years I think it\u2019s going to feel like blockchain is everywhere. It\u2019s still not true right now.", "responses": 3, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Technology", "Social Media", "Internet", "Identity"]}, {"title": "What\u2019s Hotter than the Blockchain Itself?

People had barely started to understand blockchain and in the background a new paradigm shift was already brewing.I kid you not; tokenisation on blockchain is hotter than vanilla-blockchain itself.Source: https://mashable.com/2013/07/09/excitement-gifs/ForethoughtsThe rationale behind tokenisation coincides with the rationale behind blockchain.The essence of blockchain lies in the idea of decentralising everything: Power, Money, Value.What if someone tells you that you can own a part of the Taj Mahal or the Moon or (to be extremely far-fetched) Saturn? The idea sounds radical, doesn\u2019t it?If you do happen to own a part of any of the above mentioned objects, the power of the current owners (government, or God\u2026) will dissolve. In actuality, the one who owns more part will have more say.This will breakdown all the enterprise empires and common man will gain and flourish. This will give rise to a whole new economy in the universe \u2014 The Token Economy. This economy will not be limited by governments, neither controlled by any set rules by bureaucrats, there won\u2019t be any boundaries on land. Concept of countries and citizenship will fade away. All institutions set up by middlemen will diminish. Everything will be autonomous. Everything will be one.With that being said; EVERYTHING can be tokenised \u2014 Your car, your house, free-storage on your computer etc.Tokenisation in Simple TermsImagine that you own a hard disk with 2TB (1 TB = 1024 GB) storage but about 70% of it remains unused for most of the time. So, your friend tells you that there is an app which gets you money if you offer people your unused storage. This means, people can use your unused disk space and in return of that service they will pay you. The unused part of the disk is divided into smaller parts so that each part can be put up on the \u201cstorage market\u201d for people to buy. This is essentially what is tokenisation.Similarly, anything (assets) can be broken down into divisible bits and sold by their parts \u2014 essentially known as, tokenised.How to do it?There are platforms like Ethereum, BigchainDB on which this can be implemented.In this article, I\u2019ll show you how to do it on BigchainDB.Step 1: Install BigchainDB drivernpm i bigchaindb-driverStep 2: Connect to BigchainDB nodeconst BigchainDB = require('bigchaindb-driver')const API_PATH = 'https://test.bigchaindb.com/api/v1/'const conn = new BigchainDB.Connection(API_PATH, {    app_id: 'Get one from testnet.bigchaindb.com',    app_key: 'Get one from testnet.bigchaindb.com'})The code snippet below illustrates how to create a divisible asset with 100,000 tokens associated to it.const nTokens = 100000let tokensLeftconst tokenCreator = new BigchainDB.Ed25519Keypair(bip39.mnemonicToSeed('seedPhrase').slice(0,32))function tokenLaunch() {    // Construct a transaction payload    const tx = BigchainDB.Transaction.makeCreateTransaction({            token: 'TT (Tutorial Tokens)',            number_tokens: nTokens        },        // Metadata field, contains information about the transaction itself        // (can be `null` if not needed)        {            datetime: new Date().toString()        },        // Output: Divisible asset, include nTokens as parameter        [BigchainDB.Transaction.makeOutput(BigchainDB.Transaction          .makeEd25519Condition(tokenCreator.publicKey), nTokens.toString())],        tokenCreator.publicKey    )    // Sign the transaction with the private key of the token creator    const txSigned = BigchainDB.Transaction      .signTransaction(tx, tokenCreator.privateKey)    // Send the transaction off to BigchainDB    conn.postTransactionCommit(txSigned)        .then(res => {            tokensLeft = nTokens            document.body.innerHTML ='<h3>Transaction created</h3>';            // txSigned.id corresponds to the asset id of the tokens            document.body.innerHTML +=txSigned.id        })}Now that the tokens have been minted, you can start distributing them to the owners. Tokens can be transferred to an unlimited number of participants.In this example, you are now going to make a transfer transaction to transfer 500 tokens to a new user called Bill.

We\u2019ve since incubated and invested in more than 100 projects and companies, including key pillars of the Ethereum ecosystem \u2014 Infura, Metamask, Truffle Suite, and Pegasys. We\u2019ve sought to expand the ability of developers and businesses to utilize Ethereum, and slowly bend the curve of opportunity from technical progress toward real market potential.As the Ethereum ecosystem matures, we\u2019re updating our methods to continue supporting the founders making the largest impact.Introducing Tachyon IIIToday we\u2019re opening applications for Tachyon III, our redesigned accelerator program for founders building Open Finance tools and businesses via blockchain and Web 3.0 technology.The upcoming third cohort is dedicated to Open Finance startups building more open, interoperable, and programmable financial systems and services.The 12-week program helps founders leverage Consensys\u2019 global network of Web 3.0 and blockchain experts to rapidly validate and grow their businesses.The BasicsApplications are open from August 1st \u2014 September 16th, 2019, kicking off off November 4th in New York City. Learn more and apply at the Tachyon website.Tachyon III is a full-time, on-location program bringing 8\u201312 teams together in New York City from November 2019 through February 2020. Teams will be provided funding, office space, one on one mentorship, and programming around business and blockchain specific issues, culminating in an investor day and post-program fundraising support.Redesigned for the Fundamentals:Thematic focus. Tachyon III will bring together founders, mentors, and advisors with specific skills and experience in Open Finance. We believe progress will be accelerated when literally sitting beside leading technologists and subject-matter experts.Intense, and in-person. We heard and observed, time and again, that the greatest value we offered founders during Tachyon I & II was live, fully-attentive time together. Tachyon III will double down on that with a full-time, on-location program in Brooklyn, where founders, mentors and the program team will work closely, daily, to go further, faster.Back to basics. Blockchain development is quickly entering the phase where the barriers to great Web 3.0 applications are no longer technical, but entrepreneurial. As the novelty of the technology fades, our program balances the opportunity of the emerging paradigms and business models the technology allows, while maintaining the discipline to help founders focus on the core market, customer, and growth signals they need to become market-ready ventures.Leveraging the Consensys Advantage:A global network of Web 3.0 native experts and advisors. Consensys is a Web 3.0 native company and community. Our founders, alumni, program mentors, and partners are rooted in the technical and business realities of blockchain ventures from years of experience. The Tachyon program leverages this expertise to help founders see around corners and under the hood of the new digital economy.The tools and infrastructure for blockchain development. The core tools and services for large-scale Ethereum development are part of the Consensys family. Whether it\u2019s infrastructure, developer tools, smart contract auditing services, Web 3.0 bounty networks, or token management systems, we know, build, and use them daily.Industry partnerships for access and perspective. Our corporate partnerships and programs are core to the ongoing regulatory and enterprise perspectives on Ethereum and blockchain projects. Our founders benefit from an informed overview of the market and regulatory conditions that impact their businesses as they grow.Open FinanceWe believe the most substantial impact for Web 3.0 and blockchain technology will come from redefining the relationships between people and our financial systems. While still in its early stages, the Open Financial stack powers trust-minimized financial products for a global set of users. In the last two years alone, more than $482M has been locked into Open Finance smart contracts globally.Tachyon III brings together founders working in this space to build decentralized financial networks and programmable, composable assets and services that will fundamentally reshape the global financial economy.Calling Open Finance FoundersIf you\u2019re a founder or team building the infrastructure, tools, and applications that enable a more open financial system, we\u2019d love to meet you.We look forward to building with you,The ConsenSys Labs & Tachyon TeamDisclaimer: The views expressed by the author above do not necessarily represent the views of Consensys AG.

Looking beyond the ICO, there are lots of Web 3.0 funding options that expand opportunities and will encourage business diversity.As an early stage investor, I\u2019ve met too many entrepreneurs who struggle to launch because they have a good idea but see vc funding as the only mechanism to help them build. This mindset is limiting \u2014 it restricts the scope of projects to only those with $B+ scale potential.Too many startups today are chasing difficult but obvious ideas like \u201cthe new Yelp\u201d, \u201cbetter marketing automation\u201d, and \u201cai for X industry\u201d so they can raise venture capital. Developers look for potential to scale instead of real opportunities with revenue potential. Bootstrapping is always an option but even it could use some new approaches.In 2017, we saw the rise of the ICO which shook up the idea of early project fundraising. It is imperfect and an attractive funding mechanism for scammers, but it\u2019s rise in popularity helped create a new conversation about project funding in Web 3.0. ICOs seem here to stay, but like venture capital, it isn\u2019t the right funding path for the majority of projects.Developers and startups have realized there is still a gap in funding early work. Fortunately, there are a number of mechanisms being tested to help builders find capital to build what\u2019s next.Fund your project without fundraising or an ICO1) Bounties \u2014 Open source contributions are in demand and want to compensation developers for their work. Platforms like Gitcoin, a marketplace to match open ethereum bounties with developers, make bounties easier to find. Join their network to see paid contributions from projects like Decentraland, Ethereum Network, LivePeer and Gitcoin itself. They\u2019ve hosted 235k of bounties on the site so far. Bounties range from $10 to $10,000+.2) Grants \u2014 Apply for a grant to fund your project if it relates to the goals of a protocol foundation. The Ethereum Community Foundation has put together an extensive list of grant opportunities across different networks like Aragon, Blockstack, and IPFS. Full list here.3) Decentralized network services \u2014 Build software to services in a new network. For example, Steem.it is a content network like Reddit, powered by the decentralized network Steem. Developers have created upvoting bots that publishers pay to promote their posts in the network. Steemit has paid out $40M in rewards itself, which does not include the bot payouts that work as a parallel market.4) Generalized mining \u2014 New protocols are emerging that provide economic incentives for supplying compute to validate their networks. Generalized mining focuses on building software for competitive advantage, and does not rely solely on specific hardware. Proof of stake networks like Livepeer and Tezos have validator networks that reward participants for being nodes in the network or staking in the network.5) Venture tokens \u2014 Well funded layer 1 protocols are getting into the venture business by providing venture capital in the form of tokens if you are supporting the growth of their ecosystem. The diligence process may be similar to traditional VC, but the expectations on ROI is more about \u201cgrowing the ecosystem\u201d then just return on capital invested. The EOS Block.one fund has 1B dedicated to this category, but will be deployed by a number of different firms, including $325M managed by Galaxy in New York City.We need new innovative funding mechanisms just as much as we need new business ideas. Whether you are building in the blockchain ecosystem or just looking to fund your project with the proceeds, these sources can generate runway for your ideas. Best part, you get to keep ownership.I am excited about creating more opportunities for entrepreneurs. If you\u2019ve seen other new Web 3.0 funding mechanisms, please share in the comments blow.

Once their ownership is validated, these collectibles can come alive and enjoy the adulation of a paying fanbase. They can be sold and/or bartered for tokenized non-fungible (non-replaceable) items or cryptocurrencies. Like trading baseball cards by way of frictionless, cross-border platforms.Estate planners will need to update their skills so they can stay relevant in a time when collectibles and rare possessions are taking on new meaning.In Genesis, God created man in His own image.

One that will build the foundation for Web 3.0 \u2014 a more decentralized and peer-to-peer network of businesses, brands, resources, and online education.But which communities feel the impact of this huge change in technology? Of course, we are all becoming aware of the projects that the UN is hosting abroad vis the World Food Program; quickly affecting change in countries like Jordan and Pakistan by more efficiently allocating refugee resources to people in need.The same problem that Silicon Valley has with diversity, the current global Blockchain market has with diversity.In fact, the NGO community in general has generally opened their arms to adopting Blockchain technology to help with the following:Donor Transparency and More Effective Financial ReportingCheaper Resource Tracking (Food, etc.)Cryptocurrency Donations from New MarketsLocalized token vouchers to use in exchange for donated goods (Lower Socioeconomic Micro-economies)Intelligent Solar Grid Systems for Disadvantaged neighborhoods, and so onHowever, we don\u2019t really see the opportunity of creating these systems, both in the Non-Profit and Private sectors, being distributed amongst a diverse set of engineers and entrepreneurs globally. To be frank \u2014 the same problem that Silicon Valley has with diversity, the current global Blockchain market has with diversity.But why does this matter? Two words \u2014 Social Mobility.When disadvantaged communities gain access to the education around emerging technologies, a completely different subset of problems are solved. Problems that focus on the needs of impoverished communities that high tech analysts simply won\u2019t discover on their own.In addition, youth that are exposed to how to create smart contracts, decentralized applications, and their own Blockchain networks can further empower and enlarge the existing developer communities supporting networks like Ethereum and Bitcoin, amongst many, many others.The fact of the matter is that the next generation of tech billionaires is going to come from the construction of Web 3.0 \u2014 there\u2019s a reason beyond an ideal, scalable Blockchain system that developer communities are working feverishly to scale their decentralized networks. The wealth generated from oncoming innovation must be distributed to communities that need it most, especially when it comes to sustaining equity in capitalistic economies that are already struggling with widespread stratification.The Talent Has to Come From SomewhereThe majority of the world lives in poverty, and as our collective population increases, resources will continue to diminish. This means we need every brilliant mind that we can find \u2014 not just the minds of those who start with resources.Time and time again, many of the world\u2019s greatest success stories come not from people who had a Trust Fund growing up, but from those who came from nothing \u2014 later becoming a first-generation college graduate, multi-millionaire icon, or brilliant engineer.This is especially true in a growing system of decentralized networks where the world\u2019s population is growing \u2014 in order to create inoperable Blockchain systems in impoverished areas in developing countries, those communities will need to know how to leverage their own networks to be a part of the new Internet of Things, People, and Ideas.Social Impact around Blockchain TechnologySo where do we start? How can we systematically uplift in-need communities and expose them to how technology is changing? Education, NGO collaboration, and yes, Hackathons.Education \u2014 Instill knowledge within in-need communities so that they can develop their own solutions and wealth. StreetCode Academy has already debuted the first Blockchain curriculum ever for students of color residing in East Palo Alto \u2014 and Facebook has been generous enough to offer them a whole building to operate in.NGO Collaboration \u2014 NGOs should network between each other and make the technology they use more open source to expedite the standardization of Blockchain tech usage. This increases exposure, builds an international proof-of-concept story and persuades other markets to adopt the technologyHackathons \u2014 Not just hackathons but hackathons focused on enrolling people for lower socioeconomic backgrounds to illuminate and cultivate their geniusSome of these developments are already occurring. ConsenSys is leading the Blockchain for Social Impact effort to focus on how the use of decentralized applications can generate larger impact within developing countries and poverty-stricken communities on an international scale. In fact, they\u2019re hosting a Hackathon October 2017 to challenge the developer community to think outside the for-profit scope.What are your thoughts?

Turing & Von Neumann. Eckert & Mauchly.Computing is philosophy made flesh, embedding conceptions of truth and provability into physical frameworks.In its most perfect sense, computing is a castle in the air. It was never \u2018real\u2019. It\u2019s better than.Computing had practical applications \u2014 calculating trajectories, mapping vast industrial processes, charting the census.\u201cA world market for perhaps five machines,\u201d as Thomas J. Watson once appraised.Yet with just one of those machines, someone could run the world.Bucky Fuller figured this out as he developed increasingly intricate \u2018World Game\u2019 simulations throughout the 1960s, bringing thousands, then tens of thousands, of inputs and outputs together to produce an increasingly accurate model of the workings of \u2018Spaceship Earth\u2019.Such unthinkable complexity could be managed by a genius of Fuller\u2019s stature.But it would take two more individuals of towering genius to make such complexity manageable.One coalface of complexity looked like the cockpit of a jet fighter, a machine so capable and so information rich it had become surprisingly easy for a single bad decision to kill its operator.These incredible machines had reached and exceeded human cognitive capacity.Too much data, all of it important, needed to be recognised, prioritised, ignored or acted upon.The human executive function in our forebrain is an amazing triumph of evolution but works glacially when compared to a supersonic aircraft.Could we make a machine so complicated we could not operate it? Been there, done that.Another coalface of complexity looked like everything else, a world becoming so richly linked \u2014 even by the early 1960s \u2014 that it seemed rapidly to be exceeding the capacity of even the most well-trained managers to be able to understand and respond to it, piling on data until it too overloaded the executive function.Too much there there, unthinkable complexity, and over all of it the lingering sense of a loss of control, and a plunge into another abyss, lost and overwhelmed.We are uniquely suited for phenomena at human speed and on human scale. Depart from either of these and things fall apart.We needed solutions \u2014 one for speed, another for scale, and \u2014 as if on cue, two geniuses stepped forward with their work, solving both problems comprehensively.1968 FJCC was the most important single event in the history of computing.And the absolutely unexpected and wondrous thing is this: both problems were solved at the same moment in time.I can not know what it was like to be at the 1968 Fall Joint Computer Conference of the ACM. I can only point back to it, and say, conclusively, that\u2019s when it changed. That\u2019s when everything changed.I just saw the most amazing thing I\u2019ve ever seen in my life\u2026 I\u2019m at a bit of a loss for words right now so give me a minute.OK. So I got time off from work so that I could come up from Pasadena for the ACM/IEEE meeting in San Francisco. There\u2019s a lot of great things happening at this conference but I doubt I\u2019m going to see anything else like this.A fellow named Douglas Engelbart from Stanford Research just showed a whole new kind of computer system that was nothing like I\u2019d ever seen. He called it the oNLine System. He gave about an hour and a half presentation on its functions and how they built it.Engelbart actually used the system itself to present his work, so this was both a live demonstration \u2014 and it was his presentation at the same time. Really clever.First off \u2014 try to picture this \u2014 it was a computer display where you could actually change the results on the screen. Engelbart was editing text on the screen, moving things around directly, not by typing and refreshing the display, just by\u2026 moving them around. And it wasn\u2019t just text but graphs and outlines. It was like he had a big Flipchart and he was cutting and pasting and moving bits of paper around. But he was doing it on the computer display.He showed off how to use it with some examples. First he made himself a shopping list\u2026 I know kinda silly, who\u2019s going to use a million dollar computer to make a shopping list? But anyway, it still illustrated the point\u2026 he typed carrots, potatoes, aspirin. That was so great \u2014 he just added things and they showed up on screen. But then he could reorder them with no trouble. Oh and it wasn\u2019t just a simple list \u2014 it was an outline \u2014 with indentation. And he was moving things around, up and down the outline\u2026 I can still picture it.The way he moved things around\u2026 he used a device \u2014 they call it a \u201cmouse\u201d \u2014 to pick parts of the screen, grabbed text and moved it around ON THE SCREEN. There was a thing on the screen, a little black shape \u2014 he called it a tracking spot I think. 2 wheels that roll on the surface \u2014 on in each dimension, horizontal and vertical, the computer samples that. And the control buttons that Click a button on the mouse and that activated a piece of the text on the screen, or go to those links.Then he showed us a less contrived thing, it was information about his group at SRI. Their mission statement, number of employees, how they organized their work. It was so amazing, it had not just text but pictures \u2014 a line graph of the number of employees and these tree diagrams of how the group was organized. But it was changing, every time he picked with that mouse device.Then \u2014 ok this was crazy \u2014 he would pick on a text, and then it would go to a whole another data file \u2014 he called it a link. He would go from one link, to another link, to another link and then back to the original file.There\u2019s so much, I can\u2019t remember this all.Oh yes \u2014 they did this with a live camera link to SRI in Menlo Park\u2026 microwave truck I\u2019m pretty sure.And he had a dedicated data line to send commands between his station in San Francisco to the computer in Menlo Park. THE COMPUTER WASN\u2019T EVEN IN SAN FRANCISCO.OK um\u2026 this guy Engelbart works at a part of SRI called Augmented Human Intellect Research Center. Usual funding sources: ARPA, NASA, RADC etc\u2026 They\u2019re working on what he called man-computer projects. And it\u2019s not the only man-computer group at SRI\u2026He called the system NLS \u2014 for online system apparently \u2014 with a goal for \u201cHelping humans to operate within the domain of complex information structures.\u201dThey\u2019re not calculating numbers, or sending robots to the moon. It\u2019s like they are making computers for just \u2014 for regular people. He even called the computer his friend. Ok that was a little wild.I didn\u2019t know they were talking about this stuff in public\u2026I hope we get to use something like this at JPLWhat a demo\u2026 what a demo. Blew my mind.This was the Mother of all Demos.Whew.OK that was just one thing. Now I\u2019m going to go see a guy named Ivan Sutherland talk about another kind of computer display called a Head Mounted Display. Don\u2019t know what that is but whatever it is, can\u2019t be as amazing as what I just saw.Babbage & Boole. Turing & Von Neumann. Eckert & Mauchly.Engelbart and Sutherland.Perhaps the most surprising aspect of the Mother of All Demos \u2014 and the Sword of Damocles display \u2014 was that they didn\u2019t go anywhere.Engelbart creates the NLS, with its crazy key-chording interface that no one could use and a set of mnemonic commands so frankly bizarre that the only requirement for using the NLS was to be Douglas Engelbart.He\u2019d created a system that could manage unthinkable complexity, but until Ted Nelson pulled the world \u2018hypertext\u2019 out of thin air, we didn\u2019t have a language to express what Engelbart had done.His solution to overweening complexity turned out to be too complex.Nelson\u2019s Project Xanadu \u2014 which, by very fortunate chance I encountered immediately after I\u2019d left MIT \u2014 had the language but suffered from another fatal flaw: It sought to be perfect in its first release.Perfect things rarely survive any contact with the real; the perfect is the enemy of the good.We all know what happens next.This software engineer at CERN gets a crazy idea about linking together all the disparate computer systems via a common protocol. His boss declares the idea \u2018vague \u2014 but exciting\u2019, and we\u2019re off and running.It was not a perfect idea. It was simply a good idea, both because it was a simple idea, and because it was an open idea.An idea whose time had finally come.PART TWO // 1993 // O YOU PRETTY THINGS!The other half of the world-changing moment quietly faded into the background, into countless military laboratories, secreted away within DARPA budgets.Founded just before the FJCC, Evans & Sutherland designed and built the first generations of real-time 3D computer graphics hardware.This almost exclusively meant military simulations \u2014 flight simulators and similar sorts of products.The notion of a graphics pipeline finds its first implementations in Evans & Sutherland systems. It\u2019s not much of a stretch to say that most of the dedicated graphics hardware we use today begins with them.Military research budgets during the height of the Cold War had few limits. Science and technology, we believed, would bring the Soviets down in the end.But as the Cold War winds down \u2014 and we get the swap from Brezhnev to Andropov to Chernenko to Gorbachev \u2014 there\u2019s a feeling that perhaps we can ease off a bit, and focus our talents a bit more expressively.Which is good for humanity \u2014 but perhaps not all that helpful for defence budgets.NASA defined what VR would look like for the everyone else.Scott Fisher and Elizabeth Wenzel nailed all of the essential elements of of what we think of today as virtual reality thirty-two years ago.The Virtual Environment Workstation will be remembered as one of NASA\u2019s most significant achievements \u2014 right up there with TANG.It wasn\u2019t cheap, with sensors that cost tens of thousands of dollars and cutting-edge liquid crystal displays, all of it powered by a graphics supercomputer \u2014 but it represented the first real advance on \u2018The Sword of Damocles\u2019, framing every expectation for the possibilities of virtual reality.The first generation of virtual reality organised itself around systems that cost a considerable fraction of a million dollars.But with the Cold War over, where would that money come from? Virtual reality is a very expensive solution in search of an equally expensive problem.In 1991 I founded Ono-Sendai with the expressed intention to create a networked consumer virtual reality system.The networking would be key \u2014 because the presence of another person or people would make up for the fact that the real time graphics in our system would be neither rich nor complex.Canon\u2019s Renderware revolutionised computer graphics \u2014 doing it all in software.At least, that\u2019s what I thought \u2014 until a weekend post on sci.virtual-worlds talked about a fundamental breakthrough in real-time 3D rendering, a pure software technique that yielded performance equivalent to hardware platforms costing hundreds of times more.Ono-Sendai didn\u2019t survive the cancellation of Sega\u2019s Virtua VR \u2014 which we helped to design.But the dream of networked VR went on, enabled now by a pervasive platform for networked computing \u2014 this World Wide Web thing out of CERN \u2014 and a brand new system for software rendering of interactive computer graphics.The two strands of computer science launched by Engelbart and Sutherland at the Fall Joint Computer Conference came together exactly twenty-five years later (almost to the very day) in an apartment in the Buena Vista Park neighborhood of San Francisco.VRML\u2026 this is so crazy. I\u2019m SO excited about what we\u2019re doing.So, the story of how we got here.My wife Marina and I had been thinking about making the move out to SF, to explore the Wild West. We had a mutual friend who introduced this guy Mark Pesce at a party, as someone who I might connect with, another \u201ccomputer guy\u201d who was working on something called virtual reality, visiting from San Francisco. We knew about VR \u2014 had just read Neuromancer and Snow Crash, and as luck would have it, Marina had just helped put together an event at her art school where Jaron Lanier came to present his VPL work. A giant head-mounted display that rendered crude virtual worlds with flying crustaceans\u2026 kooky but compelling I guess. I hadn\u2019t given it much thought after that.Six months later, we moved to San Francisco and, looking for friends, contacted Mark.As luck would have it, Mark lived about a six minute walk from where we had just moved in. He mounted the ascent up Duboce street and hung out with us and watched us unpack over a few beers. I asked, so Mark what do you do with virtual reality again\u2026 ?In ominous tones Mark said \u201cI\u2019m going to connect 3D graphics to the World Wide Web.\u201dI said, \u201cyou mean like Snow Crash?\u201dAnd Mark said, with the patience of an adult indulging a child \u2014 hmmm or maybe more like an alien indulging his really smart human pet \u2014 \u201cyes\u2026 like Snow Crash.\u201dSo we made VRML.It all kinda makes sense. Marina \u2014 escapee from that artificial reality known as Soviet Russia \u2014 everything was VR there. And a born artist, she\u2019s visual and visceral. Me \u2014 I ran screaming from the life of a working musician, to the safe bosom of the computer industry \u2014 but never 100% comfortable in the sciences, I always need an artistic outlet. So I guess VR was bound to be in our lives.But Mark was really driving this at first. I was bored with my day job, looking for a fun project. But he was on a mission.Oh but \u2014 hah \u2014 deep dark secret. Neither Mark or I know anything about graphics. I\u2019m a compilers geek and Mark is a network nerd. I wrote the code that parsed the simple VRML description file, Mark wrote the network code, and we glued in this library, a 3D software library by this English company Rendermorphics. Luckily their founders Servan and Kate were really sweet and didn\u2019t charge us for the code. Reality Lab could load models in OBJ format and render them, so I only had to write a tiny bit of graphics code. Thank god I was good at linear algebra at least. I guess I should go actually read that Foley and van Dam book\u2026Well, I guess the rest is history? \u2014 we sent Mark to show our demo at WWW 1 in Geneva; Silicon Graphics got all excited so we got a really well developed library in Open Inventor; and now we\u2019re blowing minds. Everyone is getting involved, from big companies to academic institutions, independent researchers, even Hollywood. Swimming pools, movie stars\u2026 hehVRML is going to be the Metaverse. It\u2019s going to take a while\u2026 5 years maybe\u2026 ? But it\u2019s happening.The \u2018cyberbanana\u2019, the very first VRML world.Tony and I were continuing the work of Engelbart and Sutherland, working through their vision in a way they could not, before Moore\u2019s Law had made everything inexpensive and pervasive.We took the Web and gave it a 3D interface.We took interactive computer graphics and bolted them onto the Web.What happened next will surprise you.There\u2019s an oft-quoted line of William Henry Gates III:\u201cWe always overestimate the change that will occur in the next two years and underestimate the change that will occur in the next ten.\u201dTen years. Ten years?Try twenty-five.Virtual reality was already mostly dead when VRML came round, a combination of too-expensive hardware, too-expensive patent lawsuits, and a hype that simply could not be sustained.But no sooner had VR died than Sony launched its Playstation, and interactive computer graphics \u2014 which few had even seen just two years before \u2014 found their way into every middle-class home in the world.For the first twenty-five years, DARPA paid for interactive computer graphics. Over the last twenty five years, Sony and Microsoft have.The evolution of Lara Croft over twenty years says it all.We entered a virtuous cycle of feedbacks between technology and marketplace, driving enormous increases in the power of these systems \u2014 Moore\u2019s Law at work again.Moore\u2019s Law also promises lower power consumption \u2014 so a system that required kilowatts of mains power and a dedicated air-conditioned room would, by 2014, sit comfortably in the palm.Fifty cents of paper and plastic: VR on a billion smartphones.That\u2019s when two engineers at Google mounted the stage at I/O, demonstrating how they\u2019d repurposed a pizza box and two plastic lenses, written a bit of software, and \u2014 voila.The modern age of virtual reality did not begin when Facebook bought Oculus to thwart Sony\u2019s Project Morpheus plans to dominate the Multiverse. That\u2019s a good story \u2014 but it\u2019s fake news.The modern age of virtual reality begins when it suddenly becomes clear that were are already more than a billion VR capable systems out there, just waiting for fifty cents of cardboard and plastic.VR had arrived \u2014 and no one had noticed.PART THREE // 2017 // WHERE ARE WE NOW?At the beginning of April I woke on a Saturday morning to learn my television had stopped working.Or, more precisely, SBS had migrated their broadcast codec from MPEG-2 to H.264.This meant they could transmit two high-definition streams in their allocated broadcast channel. But it also meant my television \u2014 which never received a firmware upgrade to handle H.264 decoding \u2014 went black.So off to the shops to buy a new television. I\u2019m a good shopper, I searched for the models available in my price range, looked at their reviews, then walked into a store for an A/B examination.Eventually, I walked out with a Sony, which handles the H.264 decoding just fine. Channels restored.Sony\u2019s televisions run Android. Making it less a television and more a huge and slightly buggy tablet.As I idly went through the pre-installed apps, I noted it had a version of the Opera browser, the perennial also-ran that\u2019s beloved of OEMs.And a thought occurred to me. An evil, impossible thought. After all, if this is a modern television, and that\u2019s a modern browser, maybe it could\u2026No. That\u2019s crazy talk. There\u2019s just no way it could.But. Well. There\u2019s no way to know for sure unless you try.So I carefully typed in a URL via the remote control (so much fun) and hit \u201cGo\u201d.For a moment, the screen was just white. Well, ok, I thought, it doesn\u2019t work. Nothing surprising there.And then, well, then it changed.For twenty-one years I\u2019ve kept webearth.org going, as a reminder to myself of what this is all about. Webearth shows the Earth as it is right now, via weather satellite. Always has.It\u2019s been through five iterations, the latest of which \u2014 two years ago \u2014 featured a complete rewrite for HTML5, WebGL, and ThreeJS.Then, last year, I added a few lines of code that brought it into compliance with WebVR.That\u2019s what I loaded onto the browser on my television set.And it worked.Well, not all of it: because clearly it\u2019s not getting a positive response when it probes for a VR headset. But everything else \u2014 all the WebGL and ThreeJS and HTML5 bits, they all work perfectly.On my television.Hello everyone and good morning. I\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t be there in person; you caught me during high season of VR and AR events \u2014 seems like there\u2019s something happening every week \u2014 and I just couldn\u2019t make it out your way today. Also, as we speak, we are about to have a birthday dinner for my wife Marina \u2014 being that it\u2019s yesterday, seven hours later over in San Francisco\u2026 if that made any sense. So a live stream wasn\u2019t an option either. But with any luck, with the help of Google Docs and iMovie, we\u2019ll still be able to have some fun today.Many thanks to the organizers of Web3D 2017, and to all of you for indulging us in our little bit of theatrics.I\u2019m beaming this to you from global headquarters of Unity Technologies in beautiful downtown San Francisco. I imagine you\u2019ve heard of us\u2026 I joined up at Unity over six months ago to help the company expand its mission from democratizing game development to democratizing all 3D development. It turns out that game engine technology, the essence of which is real time 3D rendering \u2014 though there is a lot more to it than that when you unpack everything \u2014 is the ideal basis for developing 3D applications generally, beyond gaming. For designing, manufacturing and selling products; for education and training; for visualizing big data; for science and engineering; for telling stories; for making art.I guess a lot of us have known this for a long time\u2026 It\u2019s come under various guises, and been referred with different nomenclature over the years: simulation; visualization; virtual worlds; serious games \u2014 I personally never loved that last one, by the way; and now the latest new shiny thing, virtual reality. But really this is all about real time 3D graphics, regardless of which device, form factor, whether it\u2019s flat screen or stereoscopic immersive or augmented reality, on tablets, in glasses, on contact lenses or straight to the brain. This is about 3D as the next major media type, and 3D as the basis for human-computer interface. We\u2019re about to escape the tyranny of the rectangle, and computing is going to go fully immersive. That rectangle has served us well for about thirty years but it\u2019s time to say goodbye. (Waves offscreen, wistfully) Goodbye, rectangle\u2026A lot has happened in the almost twenty four years since Mark dropped in to visit us that evening\u2026 the computer in your pocket is thousands of times more powerful than PCs in the 90\u2019s\u2026 and it can go anywhere you go; we have Gigabit networks; VR and AR hardware is light, comfortable and cheap enough (or near enough to it); and people actually know how to create interactive content for web and mobile \u2014 not just pros but pretty much anyone can make content now. All that, plus Kardashians.During this span, the industry actually did manage to get 3D running in every web browser, on every device on the planet. It\u2019s called WebGL. It just works. It\u2019s not perfect and perhaps not the right choice for long-form content, the way packaged native apps might need\u2026 but what on the web is? For short-form, snack-sized content, for e-commerce and brand experiences, WebGL fits the bill. And its friends WebVR and WebAR are deploying and will soon remake the landscapes of both the web and immersive computing\u2026 a chemical romance about to be consummated after a twenty five year courtship. Immersive experiences with frictionless publishing, instant access and discovery via the feed.What\u2019s interesting is that, while so much has changed, a lot of the fundamental problems and issues remain. How to design for immersion. What are the best UI metaphors and interaction models? Which are the killer applications, and how will they be brought to market? On the tech side, what is the best way to represent 3D data for delivery over the wire; and what formats, tools and technologies will we need to make it easy and provide a level playing field?From the creation side, the spirit of VRML lives on in markup formats like GLAM, A-frame, SceneVR and of course, VRML\u2019s genetic descendant, X3DOM. This piece of the stack is vital to really opening up creation to everyone. Professional tools like Unity, as accessible as they have gotten, can\u2019t match the ease and instant gratification of popping open a text editor, fiddling with markup, and hitting File Save. Just add View Source and it\u2019s a global platform for mashing up and copy/pasting the little bits that make up the web\u2026 on its way to becoming the Metaverse.On that last topic\u2026 such a great idea and yet, such a problem, this Metaverse. From where I sit, it seems like we continue to trip over ourselves because of preconceived notions about how it\u2019s supposed to play out. Stephenson and Cline inspired us \u2014 but the world is a very different place. Mark Twain riffing on Lord Byron said it best : \u201cTruth is stranger than fiction\u2026 but it is because Fiction is obliged to stick to possibilities; Truth isn\u2019t.\u201dWe need to get out of that Metaverse box. Another, more recent quote might be able to help us here. Vlad Vuki\u0107evi\u0107 \u2014 creator of both WebGL and WebVR \u2014 and recent hire at Unity \u2014 make of that what you will \u2014 had this to say: \u201cThe web is the Metaverse\u2026 just with a 2D interface.\u201dWell, not for long. Finally.In this somewhat overdue moment of universal triumph, one particular epiphany unfolded almost obscurely last year. A little mobile game was released. You wouldn\u2019t have heard of it\u2026Pok\u00e9mon Go.I remember the first weekend after it had been released. I had a friend visiting Sydney from America. On Friday evening we walked over to the Opera House to watch the sunset redden its white sails, while everywhere all around us all of these yoof stared into their smartphones, wrapt in concentration and delight.It seemed a very magical moment, when the invisible world of data, all around us, had unexpectedly breached the surface, a frothy play of space and light.And so it seemed in the beginning. But within a few days the residents of the Sydney suburb of Rhodes had to call the police in to break up a gathering of hundreds of Pokemon Go players who had taken to gathering in a small public park, laying out lairs, waiting for Pokemon to catch. That play created a public nuisance.A week after that, a full page article in the Los Angeles Times showed a photo of Pok\u00e9mon Go being played at perhaps the most inappropriate of all locations \u2014 Auschwitz.At this point, something began to claw at the back of my mind, an itch of memory and recognition.I\u2019d seen this before.Before all of this, before everything was fast and cheap and easy and networked, before the Web was everywhere and smartphones put supercomputers into five billion pockets. Back twenty-seven years ago. When I first started working in VR.I have always considered virtual reality to be a multi-participant medium \u2014 something that goes hand-in-hand with VR as a networked medium.But as soon as you bring even another individual into virtual reality, you import all of the humanity\u2019s pathologies.Even in 1991 it was easy enough to observe from USENET that the network would be a complicated and potentially hostile environment.Robert Morris\u2019 worm had already shown us that systems could be infiltrated and dominated.Everything we know today we already knew, back then.The foundation for all of my own work in virtual reality centers around this observation.For VR to be useful it must be networked.For networked VR to be safe it must be permissioned.This was not exactly a new or exciting concept in the early 1990s. All of the common variants of multiuser operating systems \u2014 at that time, UNIX or VMS \u2014 had strong protections and permissioning systems that kept these systems reasonably well protected against bad actors.All networked virtual reality systems need these protections.An augmented reality system is no different, and in fact needs them to a far greater degree, because AR and MR systems carry the additional consequence of the real.The real can not simply be repurposed at whim.And although Mark Zuckerberg may delight in showing how a blank wall can become a canvas for an art show, when you transpose that to a synagogue and an alt-right hate group, it becomes a very different question.We must always consider the bad actor in the first case. If we have learned nothing else in the last twenty-five years, I hope we\u2019ve learned that.The roots of the 3D Web lie in a permissioning system which I called Cyberspace Protocol. The original WWW1 paper is about seventy percent Cyberspace Protocol, and about thirty percent a description of a visualisation layer built on top of Cyberspace Protocol \u2014 as a proof that it does what it says it does.That visualisation layer evolved into VRML, while the permissioning protocol underneath it lay ignored for almost a quarter of a century, because \u2014 well, no one understood the use case.Until July of last year, when the use case became utterly apparent.It\u2019s said that, \u2018It steam engines when it comes steam engine time\u2019.Innovations occur when the ground is sufficiently prepared to receive them.Pok\u00e9mon Go proved that altHough the idea of permissioning was a generation early, its time, too, had come.Last October, at the first meeting of the WebVR W3C Community Group in San Jose, Tony presented a proposal on my behalf, for an updated and dramatically simplified \u2018Mixed Reality Service\u2019.Mixed Reality Service binds coordinates to URIs. That\u2019s all it does.It has a near analogue in DNS, which binds a namespace to IP addresses.Those coordinates can be purely virtual \u2014 x, y, z \u2014 or they can be geospatial \u2014 latitude, longitude and altitude.Pok\u00e9mon Go demonstrates an immediate and pressing need for an implementation of Mixed Reality Service in the geospatial, real world \u2014 so the world can speak for itself.Mixed Reality Service allows us to place links in space.Just as we can now add links inside of a Web page to knit the human knowledge space into a seamless whole, Mixed Reality Service weaves the fabric of the Web into the weft of the real.In March, at the invitation of the W3C, I founded the Mixed Reality Service W3C Community Group.Due to the increasing interest in augmented and mixed realities we\u2019re seeing from Facebook, Google, Microsoft \u2014 and very probably, Apple \u2014 we\u2019re telescoping the specification process into the next five months.By the time of TPAC \u2014 that\u2019s the big tech meeting for W3C Community and Working Groups \u2014 we hope to have a draft specification ready to be picked over by the big commercial orgs.We need Mixed Reality Service \u2014 or something very much like it \u2014 to help connect and arbitrate the relations between these worlds.We can\u2019t just let this happen.We have to bring all of our intelligence to bear, with a full consciousness of what has come before, applying it to the work we do today, to shape the best possible future.And oh, that future\u2026PART FOUR // 2043 // FUTURE LEGENDThe future began innocently.From the overwhelming wealth of everyone sharing everything everywhere all at once came the need to find, and from there, to search, and from the overwhelming number of replies to any search, the need to filter.From that all else follows.First filter bubbles, then as the enginery of Late Capitalism amplifies those filter bubbles in a positive feedback of confirmation bias, fake news. From fake news, broad retribalization among lines that seem ideological but are in fact neurological: trained, ingrained, and invisible.Why believe the truth when you can see the truth, and in that moment we have the gear to mix reality with perfect accuracy, the camera as editor in real-time, fed by ourselves, our biases, our machines, and our constellations of capital.All of it all of the time listening and learning, always learning \u2014 how to do the job better,how to make the smooth functioning of this newest power over the real ever more seamless, until it becomes the invisible landscape, the wiring under the map of the real.Of course, some see it differently.Happy birthday!!!Hi Mark\u2026 How\u2019s it going man? Hope all is well and you\u2019re having a splendid eight-first, high in your Sydney perch above the water line.It\u2019s a beautiful December day in Humboldt, a balmy 86 degrees\u2026 sorry that\u2019s (makes motion in air) around 30 for you Celsius types. I\u2019ll NEVER be able to do that in my head. It\u2019s a buzzing hive over here, everyone getting ready for the Secession Day celebration. The great nation-state of Cascadia turns TWENTY, can you believe it? (Sings) Onward, Cascadia!I\u2019m doing great over here. I just had my thousand-mile checkup; the robots gave me a clean bill of health. Check out the scan (makes motion in air) see that? Clean as a whistle.You know I was just thinking about that crazy keynote we gave back in Brisbane in \u201917. You know that one about the, what was it\u2026 the demo to end all demos\u2026 ? No, that\u2019s not right. Hold on \u2014 Zuck, search: (makes motion in air) that\u2019s it! The Mother of All Demos! Like, everything about computers, Douglas Engelbart had it all figured out seventy five years ago. Man that was great. Remember?Oh I\u2019m forgetting something else. Yeah. I\u2019m supposed to send this back to 2017. OK hang on. (Makes motion in air). There. Now they\u2019re seeing it too.Just want to say, thinking back about all that:We did good, buddy. We did good. Too bad it wasn\u2019t good enough\u2026 man I wish we could send more than photons back in time\u2026And yeah, we probably should have worked more on privacy and less on VR. You warned me.Oh well. Anyway, enough of that.I\u2019m about to head to New York to join Marina for the Guggenheim retrospective. She\u2019s just KILLING IT. Oh speaking of presentations\u2026 Lucian jumped a Tesla yesterday for Olympus Mons. The Terraforming Society invited him to give a talk on his latest design work, hold on, let me get that title (makes motion in air) here it is: \u201cDesigning Empathetic Androids: Informing the Cognitive with the Somatic.\u201d It\u2019s not as fun as it sounds\u2026 but damn important work. He\u2019s a great kid. I\u2019m so proud.Ok my friend\u2026 lots of love and again, happy birthday! Talk soon! Oh \u2014 see you in Brussels.Virtual reality is particularly the technology of perception.The Web is particularly the technology of knowledge.Fusing the two creates a uniquely potent hybrid of perception and knowledge that has been used all through history to sway minds, ensnare souls, and shape the world.Propaganda is not new.The more I learn, the more I see that perhaps propaganda is the basis for all civilisation, that our ability to convince one another of what is true using language may be the fundamental trait that unites all cultures that have grown beyond the boundaries of the tribe.We need to convince one another, to bind one another \u2014 religare \u2014 to make one another believe.We need this as the bulwark against the atomised chaos that threatens all organisation beyond the most basic Dunbar\u2019s Number, that hundred and fifty others we can cram between our ears.What I\u2019m saying is that this is who we are.Who we have always been.And it is driving what we have become.Technology amplifies.When we started out, fifty years ago, the Web had not amplified knowledge into a hyperabundance of factuality.Everything was harder, slower, everything needed to be invented a dozen times before it stuck.Today, we do it once and it\u2019s everywhere instantly.Everything that delights, everything that entices, everything that records, everything that responds.All of it everywhere all at once at every point.It is not enough to close one\u2019s eyes.The virtual has so invaded and colonised the real that the entire culture and everyone inside of it functions as if the virtual were real and the real virtual \u2014 and now where is the touchstone that can guide us to any sort of knowledge of the truth?Who decides?Who determines?Who can even know?Four hundred years from Enlightenment to Endarkenment, the final closing of the filter bubble. Breathing our own, stale air.

Do you Have any Friends?Web 2.0 ha has been marked by platforms and the tremendous connectivity which has been achieved through their creation. Platforms have been created by network effects which have catapulted the successes to huge valuations having amassed millions/billions of users. Wherever you look, Facebook, Twitter, Uber, Amazon, eBay, Airbnb, the string that ties all of them together is that they are platforms which only enable the possibility of a core function to occur, the value comes from the users who adopt the platform.That is the reality of what platforms are and how they grow. Without users, they are simply pieces of technology which are redundant. With users, they become thriving ecosystems housing vast swathes of humanity and they become increasingly influential.Platforms will grow and become even more ubiquitous. Today\u2019s platforms have grown to such a scale that competition is particularly difficult. This doesn\u2019t mean that it is impossible merely that a compelling product is essential to have any opportunity to compete. That being said, look at Facebook. It has been able to monopolise the platform business by acquiring competitors and upstarts fortifying its position as the most ubiquitous platform in history. Instagram and Whatsapp are prime examples of this and their strategy to remain at the forefront of the sphere become even easier as their market cap grows and their ability to access capital become even easier.Which begs the question; where will the next platforms come from? You hear it all the time apps are dead because nobody is downloading them (depending on what figures you use Americans download between 0 and 1.5 apps per month), but is that true? Does anecdotal evidence suggest our behaviours are changing or does it speak more specifically about the lack of compelling products available to download and use?Companies that flourished in the Web 2.0 era did so by creating totally new experiences, engaging customers in new exciting ways and enabled them to connect with people in ways that hadn\u2019t happened before.Web 3.0 will be marked by the same dawn.What I\u2019m trying to say is that the next wave comes when we are least expecting it. When the market has become saturated by current trends, see messaging apps, that is when the next leap happens. We are blinded by the current trends until the market has exhausted every avenue for iterative development of that method. It is easy to trace the route of messaging from SMS > iMessage > Whatsapp > Snapchat.And it goes back even further. Think about the telephone, probably the first platform which experienced network effects. The first phone wasn\u2019t valuable because who could you call? But with each additional handset the phone becomes more and more valuable and powerful.The internet has multiplied that by making participation on platforms incredibly easy. Instead of requiring the purchase of new technology we are able to use the things we already have, our phones, tablets or laptops.What needs do people have now that aren\u2019t being met by the current crop of mobile and social apps?My belief about the development of the next platform comes from the disconnected nature of current reality, at no point in human history have we been so detached from the real world and it will only get worse. We connect with people we know on facebook, we follow celebrities on Twitter and we can read answers of people we admire Quora. What\u2019s missing is a way to meet new people.I\u2019m not talking about dating, though it\u2019s questionable whether tinder and similar apps have solved any of those issues. What I\u2019m referring to is friendship, where do you meet like-minded people who stimulate you mentally? We\u2019re spending more time isolated online and that inherently triggers loneliness which manifests itself slowly by separating you from your friends. Of course, we see what they are doing on social networks but it\u2019s not us that doing it with them.That is where I foresee value, on platforms which facilitate and encourage interaction and relationships. A platform which enables live conversation, even more importantly between groups of people, would be a game changer. Slack has grown and dominated the professional sphere but a similar tool could be tremendously powerful in the personal domain. Imagine a compelling platform which seems as intimate as your business stream but between strangers who share a common purpose.What I currently envision is a snapchat like a platform but for groups and with the community nature of twitter. Where participation isn\u2019t just limited to one on one interaction or to your own social groups. I imagine a more ubiquitous platform which allows you to tap into your local area, your key interests, your sports team and any other differentiation you care to imagine. Organisation of these groups would obviously require curation but that would develop in time. Even more specifically it could become a more diverse and interesting classified network monitored by review systems of users who you\u2019ve interacted with.The future of communication and consumption is disposability, scarcity and specificity. It\u2019s personalised and specific and can be altered by you to suit what you want and need. Social networks have become stagnant because they have remained the same while the world has evolved, they\u2019ve stopped moving fast and breaking things. Crucially, though, it\u2019s about inclusivity and connection. Social networks have instilled in us a desire to be alone platforms have to encourage connections and breed a renewed sense of humanity which requires an investment in community.I would love to hear others\u2019 view of the above and if anyone would like to trial such a network drop me a message on Twitter @chris_herdIf you liked this article, it would mean a lot to me if you shared it on LinkedIn or Twitter.

I\u2019ve been public about that, also in conversation with David Mondrus and, so, that\u2019s my perspective.Not sure why people take such a short-term perspective, the web 3.0 has grown out of a long legacy, it has very deep roots, and nowhere between John Nash, Ayn Rand, Nick Szabo, Craig Wright and so on has it been a democracy, it operates on other types of rules. I understand that people are afraid of competing with the consensus trance, people always have been, and it takes courage, which Tristan Roberts and Amin Rafiee have both shown, very impressed by them both.It is very hard work to go against the consensus trance, that has been experienced by pioneers always, Galileo, and so on, and because people pushed on, society has evolved. It has never been easy, it will never be easy, that is part of the job, and, it has always been a very lonely experience.I recommend this blog post to see what the web 3.0 is not, the web 3.0 is not about forgetting brilliant thinkers like Foucault and so on, but about building on top of them. This is a marathon, not a sprint, and its roots go back decades, centuries, millennia, eons, and so on.The proof-of-power mining system, which is also inspired by Tristan Roberts, and Anthony Donofrio, is one product that I have designed, building on four years of Bitnation as a social infrastructure, and that was exactly what Susanne Tarkowski Tempelhof envisioned with the original Bitnation whitepaper \u2014 a social infrastructure.

Many rely on the rising speculation bubble to power the token\u2019s value without designing in how the business activity, which the token is supposed to facilitate, will fund and support the value after bubbles burst.This is especially evident in token offerings (and their related decentralized organizations) that aim at hacking social causes, like getting people to stop chopping down rainforests.But TreeLeaves is different.The organizers of TreeLeaves are connected to two key groups. The first is a set of global land developers that have an incentive to show that their activities support the environment. They fund the TreeLeaves token and receive, in return, a branding badge that shows the level of support they offer to ensure that natural resource areas are preserved. (This is the first group of funding entities, but TreeLeaves plans an expansive market for this.)The second group TreeLeaves works with is a vast network of satellite and other geo sensing sources that collect verified data on things like the health of a given hectare of land, anywhere in the world. This is now being supplied by investment from the Chainlink network.With these two groups\u00a0working\u00a0in\u00a0tandem\u00a0via\u00a0the\u00a0Ethereum\u00a0mainnet, here\u2019s the TreeLeaves scheme:It turns out that much of the endangered rainforest in Africa, Asia and South America are held by small landowners. And they are cutting down the forest at an alarming\u00a0rate. TreeLeaves gives these landowners a blockchain-secured title record to their land, and a digital identity tied to a blockchain wallet. That wallet will automatically receive TreeLeaves tokens as long as the landholder owns the land and as long as GroundTruth sensors show that the land is producing readings consistent with healthy rainforest. In fact, if the readings\u200a\u2014\u200aoxygen production for starters\u200a\u2014\u200agoes up, they get more tokens. If it goes down, less tokens. Result: incentive for the landowner to not only not cut down the trees but to invest in their health.Already, the TreeLeaves token offering has gone through the roof with accredited investors ramping the price. But this time, that\u2019s all about people wanting to chip in and add heft to the incentive rather than pure speculation as with some token offerings in the past. This is great for those landowners\u2026and the trees. (Rich people don\u2019t tend to cut down rainforest to buy food.) But even if the speculation bubble bursts, the organic token funding from builders and land developers seeking brand enhancement\u2014and sometimes even genuinely wanting to support the environment\u2014will keep the monetary value to these small landowners flowing.Web3Studio is a team that conceives of audacious, novel uses of Web3 technologies, builds some of them, and donates the work to the open source community.

However, they\u2019re fiat-collaterized which means they have underlying challenges: The collateral assets are still subject to inflation and centralized monetary policies.Moreover, the coins can be linked to identifying information, which reduces people\u2019s privacy when it comes to their finances. And these coins can be frozen or destroyed by issuing entities, which reduces investors\u2019 control over their funds.Still, stablecoins offer key benefits: They give cryptocurrency investors the ability to avoid volatility and to temporarily position themselves outside of crypto valuations.Stablecoins, like Apollo (APL) and other cryptocurrencies, can also greatly improve economic efficiency. For example, merchants can transact in U.S. dollars (or other fiat) and do so with greatly reduced transaction costs and much faster settlement times \u2014 thanks to blockchain.With stablecoins, merchants won\u2019t have to pay Mastercard and other financial entities their exorbitant fees.Because of distributed ledger technologies (DLT), expensive and inefficient middlemen (such as Visa, PayPal, and other payment processors) can be removed from peer-to-peer, frictionless payments.While stablecoins have limitations, they can be greatly advantageous due to the benefits of blockchain. True USD, USD Coin, and Paxos are three projects that are currently in the top 35 on CoinMarketCap. (Paxos is the official stablecoin on Apollo decentralized exchange.)Change is slow: The vast majority of people still prefer to pay or get paid with sovereign fiats. However, stablecoins are introducing people to digital money. Many are also realizing that blockchain-powered transactions can be much more efficient than paper cash, and that expensive third parties may not be needed in most cases.We\u2019re already mostly a cashless society as more than 95% of monies in developed nations are electronic in nature, such as electronic funds deposited in checking and savings accounts.Apollo Foundation believes in the power of distributed and trustless money that give users complete privacy. We\u2019re building an unregulatable and untraceable cryptocurrency so you can pay, trade and invest with ease.Apollo (APL) will be an all-in-one cryptocurrency that has much utility. APL will give users the ability to perform any blockchain-related task offered by mainstream cryptos, all in a single platform.\u201cFreedom is not a gift bestowed upon us by other men, but a right that belongs to us by the laws of God and nature.\u201d \u2014 Benjamin Franklin", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Apollo", "Cryptocurrency"]}, {"title": "Internet in 2025", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@mhj/internet-in-2025-1886d5b08f1b?source=search_post", "author_name": "Mikko J\u00e4rvenp\u00e4\u00e4", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@mhj", "publish_date": "2018-01-16", "last_modified_date": "2018-02-24", "readtime": "11.2", "claps": 107, "voters": 8, "content": "Internet in 2025Mikko J\u00e4rvenp\u00e4\u00e4FollowJan 16, 2018 \u00b7 12 min readWeb 3.0 \u2014 the Web of Economic NodesMain prediction: Web 3.0, or the Participatory Web, will see economic activity as its main node of activity and value. It will be enabled by peer-to-peer connections, but also result in economic winner(s).Nell Watson of Singularity University recently presented a compelling analysis of internet macrotrends. Web 1.0 was all about linking. The value it unleashed on the world was that of information. Access, organization, and usefulness of information nearly universally. The winner who emerged from Web 1.0 was of course Google, whose empire was built on bridging the creator and consumer of information. Web 2.0 by contrast was more about liking. The value created was around the social connection of individual, corporations, and other actors. Not the information, but the source itself. Facebook won Web 2.0, as you\u2019ll probably agree. Web 3.0 will be built around asset ownership and economics. Key factor here is Blockchain or similar consensus networks in general. The main winner emerging from Web 3.0 could well be Amazon \u2014 in addition to its e-commerce empire, where it has already proved itself and grown huge through the 1.0 and 2.0 webs even if not grabbing the very top position in either historical period of the web. Using this analysis as the starting point and to get rid of the version numbers, I\u2019ll call the first iteration the Informational Web and the second the Social Web. The third one I\u2019ll tentatively coin the Participatory Web.It looks to me that we are currently in watershed times between the Social Web and Participatory Web. In the discussions I had with Silicon Valley VC\u2019s in 2017, the main trend I heard was the lack of a trend. There\u2019s no clear type of startup or vertical that is currently attracting investment, and bets are being placed pretty broadly. This is different from the major trends of mobile funding, social applications, and sharing economy bets that were placed in their own trends during the last 10 years or so. There are pockets of higher activity of course \u2014 AI and machine learning ventures are getting funding and even some hype. Blockchain startups are early, and are partly funding (or inflating, if you\u2019re more critical) with ICOs, which may mean they will already have crucial momentum before going to VCs. I take this as just one signal that the technology industry is searching for the \u201cnext big thing\u201d, the industry, category, or channel that will clearly take off.Another reason for the current tectonic shift is the psycho-social change enabled by the sharing economy. I\u2019m not alone in arguing that a key to Uber\u2019s success was not just the smartphone, but also the recently learned trust in systems of trust. By using Amazon, eBay, Yelp, Tripadvisor and numerous other sites where credible user reviews were a major part of the value proposition, we the general population have learned to trust these systems. Uber of course needed its own trust review system, but it also needed to operate in a time when users would trust such review systems to be successful. Without both of those, an Uber ride would just be getting into a stranger\u2019s car, using a faceless application to ask the stranger to take you and your loved ones to their destination. And despite this example, I\u2019m more of a Lyft rider myself.The irony of the sharing economy \u2014 better called the gig economy \u2014 is of course that it\u2019s not about sharing. It\u2019s about employing a middleman like Uber, Airbnb, or Getaround to facilitate that trust. Smaller middlemen have been cut out throughout both the Informational Web and the Social Web just like Uber cut out the taxi companies. Only if the new middleman offers a platform that has not existed before does it have a chance at domination. I\u2019m probably in the minority in thinking that the jury is still out on Uber: the switching costs of customers are very low, the company\u2019s inventory is ephemeral and often also in service of its competitors, and the routing technology is widely available.Psychographic change supports this direction (though demographics may counter this as Western populations are getting older). Millenials today are about 35 to 25 years old. In 2025 they are 33\u201343 years old, closing to peak income. Millenials put less value on ownership and on roots than the generations before them. If the same economic attitude continues, this enforces the sharing economy trend.By 2025 we\u2019ve seen the rise of a major \u201csharing economy\u201d network that is decentralized, enabled by blockchain-like technology, and powered by it\u2019s members. The Participatory Web will also enable middleman-less commerce where ownership and provenance are proven and tracked. This could happen with commerce, logistics, asset sharing, or even with real estate.The Rise of Artificially Facilitated ExperiencesMain prediction: No AGI, but Turing Tests will be passed. Orders of magnitude better versions of Microsoft\u2019s Office Assistant will permeate all experiences.Artifical General Intelligence will not happen by 2025. But what will happen is the permeation of algorithmic interaction in people\u2019s everyday lives. Like businesses today have frameworks and services for building chat bots, in 2025 you will have your pick of AI frameworks to employ for your product or service. \u201cArtificial facilitation\u201d (AF) will be an expected feature of interactions on the web, whether or not human-to-human interaction is included. The biggest dataset will have the best starting point for creating the AFs, and a company like Facebook, Google, or Microsoft will have released an AI that ostensibly passes Turing Tests on the Web. This is not to say that the AI is conscious or has human-level intelligence \u2014 but it will have sufficiently complex behavior to trick us into thinking so. AF will be a major component in the experience provided by a company. And yes, AF is the Return of Clippy, just better.I\u2019ll include faster broadband speed here. We\u2019ll mostly be surfing 5G or 6G in 2025 when on the move, and optical fiber to households is commonplace. This is key both for the richness of the experience coming at us down the pipe, but also for the amount of sensor data that can be uploaded about our context, which makes for better AF.Tangential prediction: the job title \u201cproduct manager\u201d will decline in popularity and be replaced by \u201cexperience manager\u201d or a similar title, better reflecting how these professionals create value. This reflects the larger ongoing shift to customer-centricity.Virtuality of Experiences and Their ContextMain prediction: VR will dominate gaming, AR is widely adopted but not ubiquitous.Like jetpacks, we\u2019ve been promised Virtual Reality since the early days of sci-fi. VR has had some false starts over the last couple of decades, but by 2025 VR will be the preferred mode of delivery for interactive entertainment, gaming especially but also other live events. Expect VR spectatorship in live e-sports tournaments, for example. Augmented Reality will see high adoption in contexts where it makes sense to have both hands free, senses on the task, and access to information and assistance. In business or content creation contexts, however, I predict AR\u2019s adoption to be of the same level that tablets are today. They make sense in some scenarios, and mix rather well with other devices, but they are not the ubiquitous device like the laptop is, and they do not yet enable telepresence that would be preferable to the real thing. In 2025 we will see a clearer path to AR taking over mobile devices and laptops, but we won\u2019t be there yet. This less bullish prediction of AR is based on the total complexity of the human interaction: the nuances of body language, the cues by others\u2019 interactions, perhaps even pheromones all work together to complicate the human condition so much that AR telepresence will not replace the real thing in trust.Tangential prediction: we will have a new gig economy job in the form of gargoyles as presented by Neal Stephenson in Snow Crash. Gargoyles are humans equipped with all the necessary sensors to deliver a virtual experience of that place at that moment to subscribers of the gargoyle\u2019s feed. Perhaps in 2025 we will even talk about gargoyles soon losing their gig jobs to robots like we today talk about drivers losing theirs to autonomous vehicles.Multiple Internets and AccessMain prediction: opposing forces are at once pulling the internet into non-neutral lanes, and pushing internet services and even large platforms to be regulated as utilities. Main body of the internet remains free and open as it is today. This means advertising revenue will dominate content production businesses.Whether or not Net Neutrality ends up dead in the hands of shoot-from-the-hip FCC that Trump\u2019s administration put together, we may in 2025 see multiple internets existing in parallel. But my coin toss points in a different direction \u2014 internet will not only remain free, it will become more decentralized and more regulated at the same time. By 2025 we\u2019ll have seen the first decentralized sharing economy platforms, but we will also have seen a more cooperative, decentralized internet access provision and management. We may also see more utility-like regulation applied to algorithmic media services like Facebook and Google (and yes, if you mediate information, you are a media company). Internet access will be widely argued to be a human right and even enforced as such by progressive European countries. Key components of that access \u2014 email, Facebook, information-providing algorithms \u2014 will be increasingly viewed as rights. You can still pay for content by degrading your consumption experience with sensory overhead: advertising will continue to fuel most of content production and entertainment. In advertising also lies the reason why the quality and factuality of the content is no better than in 2017. John Battelle just analyzed this poignantly in the context of today\u2019s Facebook.New Interactivity and InterfacesMain prediction: we will be nearly liberated from digit-based interactions and use voice, gestures, and learn to rely more on implicit contextual input.With the improvement in voice, image, and gesture recognition, we will finally see liberation from the finger-input interfaces that got us this far. Three trends combine into making this a reality: advances in sensors and processing technology; big data captured at scale that unlocks ever-lower error rates; and the UX innovations required to make the human users comfortable and proficient in the new interfaces. The main giants already have excellent voice controlled interfaces in Alexa and Google Home, but getting better at voice is only part of the battle. Adding more context from other ambient sensors and other interactions will increase the accuracy of predictions and interpretations. A smart assistant with access to mobile, retail orders, and viewing behavior can figure out for instance that if the human user got less than 7 hours of sleep, woke up less than 60 minutes before leaving the house in the morning, and gave grumpy-sounding voice commands to their smart home assistant is likelier to order junk food and watch junk sitcoms on demand than they would on a healthier morning pattern (Amazon can probably already figure some of that out). The junk food is only a minor negative result: an unethical advertiser, or merely a modern ad-optimizing algorithm, can exploit cues like that and offer deals that a healthier, more attentive subject would not fall for. Target susceptibility will be a key (even if implicit) ad targeting driver.This is part of the psychological change required to get the most out of the predictive contextual inputs. The main question of trust today is more about whether we trust Google and Amazon enough to keep our ever-listening smart home assistants plugged in all the time. Once they provide dramatically higher benefits to the user, the trust question becomes whether one trusts the technology to provide the best outcome for them. We\u2019ve seen parallels in the past \u2014 at first it didn\u2019t feel like a very good idea to broadcast your location by sharing photos, and it still may not in fact be an entirely safe practice, but the perceived social benefit of photo sharing greatly outweighs the perceived risk for most social media users. We need to learn to trust predictive contextual monitoring, and this is where algorithmic advertising can really hinder progress.Autonomous Personal AgentsBonus overall prediction: emergence of Autonomous Personal Agents.Combining the trends of Web 3.0, Artificial Facilitation, Virtual World experiences, new Interaction types, and the potential of Multiple Internets, we arrive at a hugely revolutionary development: Autonomous Personal Agents, or APAs for short. The APA is a smart bot that represents its owner and is empowered to a certain degree to act for its owner with other people, organizations, or other APAs.While that may sound far-fetched, this is an old trend. We\u2019ve created narrowly conditional actors on the web for a long time. Ebay sniping is one niche example: a sniping bot can be told to bid for item one at price of $45, and if that is not won, then bid for item two at $55, both 5 seconds before auction close. IFTTT (If This Then That) has allowed users to chain together conditional events between different products and services like the name implies. In the financial markets, we\u2019ve been placing conditional buy and sell instructions for decades. Recently, innovations like smart contracts and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) built on blockchain technology are steps towards APAs.Everything gets smaller, including AI. Today even a rudimentary AI-like experience needs huge amounts of data to train, and still the human experiences of talking with Siri, Alexa and the like are lacking. Humans have a very low error tolerance for other human-like agents. We are experts in noticing if something is off.The need for a large dataset may seem like an unsurmountable obstacle, but there are ways around it. We may find better ways of extracting lower errors rates based on the same dataset. In an example from Google in 2016, the company\u2019s Translate product was improved faster than expected after moving to a neural network-like version (\u201cThe A.I. system had demonstrated overnight improvements roughly equal to the total gains the old one had accrued over its entire lifetime\u201d says the New York Times article).We may be able to create larger datasets by joining together and pooling our data. Companies like Google and Facebook already have quite a bit (though of course they want more, much more) so they have the head start in building AI. Projects like Ocean Protocol may help others to create AI with larger datasets. And we may see decentralized, peer-to-peer projects that collect data with the aim of reducing AI error rates.But we should also expect to see other, less pathological methods of generating data for individual purposes. To oversimplify, the motto of the advertiser and the product manager and the AI researcher alike has this far been the quote \u201cif I had asked my customers, they would have told me they wanted faster horses\u201d, which is used to justify that instead of having people tell us what they want, we should just observe them and deduct from these observations what they really should be offered. But that quote is just as misleading as it\u2019s purported origin (Henry Ford most probably never said anything like that). We know people\u2019s statements are more virtuous and aspirational than their actions, but if if we only focus on their actions, we ignore the better part of the person, the one that wants to act morally and holds themselves to a high standard \u2014 if it just wasn\u2019t for all the reality around them. But today we only optimize for the baser instincts, immediately evident in behavior. That\u2019s how we arrived at click-bait articles. Everyone hates them, yet everyone clicks on them enough to make them the winners compared to actual quality content.We humans are capable of expressing what we want, but due to our cognitive limitations we may not be always accurate, and often are incongruous. We say we want to lose weight, but we forget to say we also really really want to eat anything that even vaguely smells like syrup. We say we love animals, yet we harm and exploit intelligent beings like pigs and cows. We have preferences, and we need to be able to better express, evaluate, validate, and store those preferences \u2013 and when necessary, make tradeoffs and resolved conflicts arising from our cognitive limitations. If expressed sufficiently accurately and comprehensively, these preferences can be then used to coordinate with others. If in renting a car, for example, our APA knew we value car brand prestige a little higher than convenience, for example, it can choose to rent us a BMW from Getaround even if the Beamer is a little further away than the Prius and the Mazda. If our APA knew we were willing to sell our extra concert tickets for $100 today, and for $80 tomorrow, it could negotiate with the other APAs whose owners are looking for the tickets within their own price conditions.Peer to peer commercial transactions are rather trivial examples in what APAs can help us do. The real reason why something like an APA model is imminent is the huge overhead we have in communication, coordination, negotiation, and bargaining between people and organizations. Let me know if you have ideas for how to fix that.

(Credit: Don Brutzman)A fortnight ago I ran the first Mixed Reality Service BOF (birds-of-a-feather) meeting, at Web3D2017. It was well attended \u2014 perhaps half the conference delegates found their way to our cozy quarters at QUT\u2019s Garden Point campus \u2014 and surprisingly contentious.Being the first time that I\u2019d fronted a group who had at a solid understanding of the 3D Web, I was expecting some pushback \u2014 mostly around technical points. But the pushback was more around the philosophical aims of MRS, rather than any particular technical goal.In short: people don\u2019t like rules. Developers especially don\u2019t like rules, and insofar as MRS has been touted (largely by me) as a way of providing guidance to AR apps like Pok\u00e9mon Go, so that they\u2019re only playable in the appropriate spaces; or to keep walls from being the target of hate speech \u2014 all of these seem quite restrictive to a generation of developers who are just beginning to explore the possibilities of mixed realities.When MRS is framed in highly formal terms \u2014 with canonical \u2018registrars\u2019 mapping onto various aspects of legal and traditional ownership \u2014 that\u2019s where the folks at Web3D2017 had the most questions, and the most misgivings.On the other hand, the idea of mapping URIs to coordinates broadly seemed to be accepted as a good thing \u2014 as long as it doesn\u2019t come encumbered with too many rules and restrictions.Although the analogy with DNS is imprecise, it\u2019s as though folks want the benefits of running their own local nameservers, without worrying about the canonical DNS servers.That harkens back to a very early Internet of the 1970s and 80s \u2014 before DNS \u2014 when every systems administrator managed their own hosts file by hand. Rolling-your-own meant you could have any namespace mappings you desired, and they\u2019d work out fine for anyone using your nameserver.Gradually, that grew impossible to maintain, and people accepted the canonical nature of DNS as an acceptable trade-off for a namespace that could grow effectively without limit (and which continues to grow today).Over the course of the BOF it became clear that MRS needs a change of direction, reorienting toward the needs of the people who want to use it \u2014 but don\u2019t want to be restricted in their use of it while they have a play.Learned heaps in the MRS BOF; had some assumptions questioned. (credit: Don Brutzman)There\u2019s nothing unusual about that; new technologies often need a \u2018magic circle\u2019 where folks can play and explore and learn without the fear of failure \u2014 or too many rules. It\u2019s in this play that the necessary scope of rules are discovered.All of that calls for a change in course.The whole history of the Internet \u2014 from email to DNS and on to the Web and pretty much everything else built atop it \u2014 has followed one rule of thumb: \u201crough consensus and running code\u201d. Rough consensus means folks should agree what needs to be done \u2014 though not necessarily in detail, and running code implements that consensus.The rough consensus for MRS in June 2017 isn\u2019t anything grand or global, just something useful enough to empower a generation of mixed reality applications on the Web. A simple, local version of Mixed Reality Service, so people can develop their own apps, using MRS to support their ideas.One of the best things about Web3D2017 was meeting Blair Macintyre, creator of Argon.js, and who showed off a neat development environment \u2014 Glitch \u2014 from the same folks who created Stack Overflow.Glitch makes it super easy to create Node.js web apps, so over last weekend I ported the Python 2.7 implementation of the MRS server to Node.js, running on Glitch. Have a play.Better yet, Glitch is all about code sharing, so follow this link to the project, which you can clone and use to run your own MRS server.Everyone can now have a play with MRS. This play will teach us what we really want to use MRS for.", "responses": 2, "tags": ["Nodejs", "Mrs", "Mixed Reality", "Web3d", "VR"]}, {"title": "What is the Internet of Values?", "post_link": "https://medium.com/swlh/what-is-the-internet-of-values-3f14b5d35a90?source=search_post", "author_name": "The Cryptocurrency Consultant", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@thecryptoconsultant", "publish_date": "2019-05-24", "last_modified_date": "2019-06-12", "readtime": "8.41", "claps": 18, "voters": 4, "content": "What is the Internet of Values?A Story of the Web 3.0 and cryptocurrenciesThe Cryptocurrency ConsultantFollowMay 24 \u00b7 9 min readOfficially, there is no definition for this term. Only the developers of the cryptocurrency Ripple formulate a vision of what the Internet of Values could mean. According to Ripple, the Internet of Values should be carried out almost in real time, and \u201cvalue\u201d can mean money, intellectual property or securities. This means that really everything that has value can be transferred via the Internet in the future. This development is driven, among other things, by the global adaptation of block-chain technology in the FinTech sector, in the logistics sector, in the trade and service sector, but also in the gaming sector, to name just a few examples. (I get commissions for purchases made through links in this post.)What is Value?Basically, values of any kind, whether in a moral-social sense or in a material sense, categorically distinguish that they differ from other values. Individual values must have a unique selling point in order to be able to identify and capture them at all.This unique selling proposition leads to the fact that individual values can not only be described specifically, but these can be distinguished also in comparison with other values, from each other. Only through the unique selling proposition can something to which a value is assigned be more valuable than something else or be less valuable than something else. In a simple example, an apple is worth less than a laptop. Both objects can only be valued differently by assigning the individual values depending on the nature of the good under consideration.The unique selling point of values is also a necessary condition for the quantification of things. If values would not exhibit this unique selling point, it would not be possible to express a mathematical or physical quantity, for example. Especially in the economic area, it would have not insignificant consequences if a trader could not determine how many books he sold for how much money. He would not be able to calculate how high his income would be and accordingly would not be able to calculate how many books he would have to sell in the next week to cover his fixed costs. Trading books would be pure gambling.Values generally help to quantify quantities in order to make them measurable. Measured and quantified quantities provide orientation and can lay the foundation for future action. This applies not only to economically described values but also to moral-social values. The basic essence of valuing goods, actions, events, situations or anything in general that can be valued is to distinguish between different values in order to focus on individual values. The more value judgments are made, depending on the context, this can lead to a reduction in the complexity of reality. The simpler reality is perceived, the easier it is to act.A further characteristic of the meaning of the term \u201cvalue\u201d becomes clear through lack. This becomes particularly clear in the case of goods that are needed for survival. Those who lack water, food and a roof over their heads will attach great importance to getting all this into their possession so that they can survive. But even a trader who urgently needs gold-plated door handles for wooden doors will attach great importance to getting them into his possession due to the lack of door handles.Another example is naturally occurring resources, which are limited. Gold, diamonds, or crude oil are resources that have a fixed value because they are limited. Air, on the other hand, if it is plentiful, has almost no value, because it is usually available to everyone without effort. Values have a unique selling point that allows them to be distinguished from other values and generally quantified. Another component of the meaning of values is lack. Lack of something in something makes value preferences particularly evident.Value in the economyIn general, it can be said that at various levels, the economy is operated in order to satisfy human needs in a planned manner. Within economics, the term \u201cvalue\u201d refers to a quantitative assessment of goods, services, and receivables. Nowadays, fiat currencies such as the US dollar, the euro, the yen or, for example, the Icelandic krone serve as universal means of value transfer, which makes goods, services, and receivables quantitatively measurable.Economic valuation distinguishes between values and prices of goods or services. While the value of a good or service can be determined intersubjectively, prices reflect the subjective perceptions of market participants. For example, a mobile phone produced in China may have an actual value of 10 euros, with the cost of resources, transport, and production of the phone already included, and sold in an industrialized country for 800 euros. The value of this mobile phone is therefore 10 euros, while the price is 800 euros. However, the same telephone can cost half as much in another country. The price of a good depends rather on how much subjective value buyers place on the product. All economic objects, i.e. everything that can be sold, can be provided with a value and a price.What is the Internet of Values?The term \u201cInternet of Values\u201d describes the digital space of the Internet as a medium for transferring and storing values of all kinds. Blockchain technology plays an essential role here. The blockchain guarantees the exchange of some goods in real time. The following value carriers can be counted towards this:CurrenciesSecuritiesIntellectual propertyMusic, artScientific findingsDigital contractsDigital identities and much moreHow is that possible? Blockchain technology has properties that prevent values from being corrupted and can, therefore, be stored on the Internet of Values. Values stored on a blockchain cannot be copied. In general, blockchain technology has a trust-building effect.The blockchain as a store of valueBlockchains function decentrally. This means that a decentralized blockchain is never stored on only one computer. Rather, the digital account book is stored and managed by a large number of computers that are connected to each other. Furthermore, no single computer can change the protocol of a blockchain system alone. Decentralization also means that blockchain systems are particularly secure because malicious actors are immediately excluded.Blockchain systems also have a fixed, programmed control system, which cannot be changed without further agreement. This makes blockchain systems not only particularly secure but also trustworthy. In addition, blockchains are transparent. On the Bitcoin blockchain, for example, everyone can see publicly who transferred how much to whom and when. If one abstracts the principle on blockchains, which document trading in securities, every authorized person can see at any time which security was sold by whom to whom. This fundamentally increases the confidence of users in the respective block chain, because important information can be viewed at any time.Blockchain systems are extremely efficient. A transaction in a crypto currency takes a maximum of a few minutes, whereas a transfer from one bank to another can take several days. Transactions in crypto currencies cost almost nothing and are irreversible. Another advantage of blockchain systems is that they can be accessed worldwide by anyone with Internet access. Apart from that, blockchain technology can represent almost any imaginable value. This does not only count for crypto currencies or securities. Fundamentally, blockchain technology can be programmed for any imaginable value, making the Internet of values possible.Examples for the Internet of ValuesBlockchains offer a technology that enables the Internet to store and exchange a wide variety of values, whether for private or commercial purposes, securely and transparently. This includes the following sectors.Crypto currencies and the FinTech industryAt the latest since the establishment of Bitcoin (What is Bitcoin?), it has become clear that digital currencies hold the future of money. Crypto currencies have the advantage that they produce and distribute their own tokens in the sense of a DApp and provide a simple P2P transaction system via the blockchain. In general, blockchain technology offers the potential to enable global, cross-border, fast, efficient and cost-effective transactions within the FinTech industry.LogisticsIn the logistics industry, it is very important to be able to trace supply chains. Blockchain technology offers the advantage that all involved parties, such as ports, customs authorities or forwarders, can gain an insight into the current delivery status of goods. Companies can also save themselves tedious bureaucratic documentation work. Maersk, a shipping company, has already worked with IBM on a blockchain project to track container shipments. For example, the transport of pineapples from Columbia to Rotterdam could be traced.Creative ContentThe use of blockchain technology in Creative Content generally implies the management of the intellectual property. Musicians, artists, writers, but also journalists can use Blockchain technology not only to make their own works available online, but also to decide what they share, how much they charge for it, and who they grant access to it.Quality of informationAt a time when the term fake news is making the rounds, blockchain technology can ensure that the quality of information is guaranteed. It is conceivable not only that information about the blockchain technology is checked for its quality, fake news is excluded accordingly, but also that information is not spread twice.Social MediaIn the social media sector, blockchain technology can ensure that users can decide for themselves who is allowed to view shared content and who is not. This also applies to companies behind social networks. In addition, users can decide which information they see and which they do not. For the commercial use of social networks, this means that information can be shared across multiple networks simultaneously.e-Commerce sectorThe e-commerce sector, i.e. online trading, forms an interface between the logistical and financial application areas of blockchain technology. Basically, online merchants can offer goods via the blockchain technology, customers can create their own profile based on the blockchain and place orders. On the basis of the blockchain, vendors can see directly who ordered what and when and thus send the ordered product very early. Customers can pay directly via crypto currencies.The Internet of Things (IoT)The Internet of Things can find a programming environment in blockchain technology that cannot be hacked. This plays a particularly important role with regard to a self-propelled car or a smart home.GamingThe gaming sector is an essential economic factor. In the gaming sector, in-app purchases and the storage of purchased items can be handled via a block chain.Digital identitiesIt is conceivable that states will no longer issue identity cards, but create unique, digital identities of citizens in order to identify them on the Internet. This would not only have the advantage that citizens could see at any time what information is collected about them, but also that administrative procedures could be shortened. It would also be conceivable to hold elections via a blockchain system.Digital contractsIt is already possible to conclude fully digitized contracts via the Ethereum blockchain. This means that several parties from different regions can conclude a contract, whose contents are automatically executed when the contract is fulfilled.Further application possibilitiesOther areas of application for blockchain technology include insurance, invoices, licenses, documents, and proof of ownership.The Internet of Values offers the infrastructure of tomorrow\u2019s InternetConclusion on the Internet of ValuesThe Internet of Values offers the infrastructure of tomorrow\u2019s Internet. The term describes the Internet as a transfer and storage space for any conceivable value. Blockchain technology, in particular, can make the Internet of Values a reality because it ensures that values can be stored and shared securely, decentrally, efficiently and transparently. It is difficult to predict the consequences that this will have in the future. Nevertheless, there are already a few examples today that testify to the Internet of values.If you like what you read be sure to \u2665 it below \u2014 as a writer it means the world.

Since then I have read and wrote a ton of them.But it hasn\u2019t been a smooth ride.As developers, these articles are one of the biggest parts of our lives, after StackOverflow, coffee, and pizza.These articles help us toLearn new stuff for work.Hacking something, and bragging about it.Workarounds or Fixing critical issues.Life lessons, Inspiration and a lot of other stuff\u2026I spend most of my time doing the first 3 things. We all do. And the hard truth is that we waste a lot of time on them.Seriously, a lot of time.This doesn\u2019t mean that the articles are bad. They are just victim of the common problems that most of the developer articles suffer from today.And yes, it\u2019s the same story with my articles too\u2026After reading a ton of articles, I found out that there are 4 main problems that most articles face.Problem #1: The Maintenance ManiaPhoto by Zach Vessels on UnsplashLike everything in this world, articles also have a limited life.We maintain our cars, homes & laptops to prolong their life. But most of the authors forget this when it comes to their articles.This problem can occur in multiple forms:The article has some code examples that are buggy, since the day they are published.The article was considered GOLD when it was published. But with time the code examples don\u2019t work anymore and now the article is referenced by a lot of other articles, and your friends. The only thing it does now is to waste peoples time. A lot of time.A lot of times, authors don\u2019t respond to the queries and comments of readers who have found a bug in the article.And yes, sometimes I am one of them too\u2026Sometimes, I also miss the commentsBut I did clap for him though.Eventually, these articles turn into debris floating in the vast digital space, damaging authors reputation and readers time.Problem #2: The Sea Level of ExperiencePhoto by American Public Power Association on UnsplashAs sea level varies across the globe, the experience level of developers also varies from one developer to another.We all go through a phase of a developers life when we hoped that we could copy the terminal command like below and it would work.$ cd myProjectMost of us also copied the $ sign and wondered why I am the only person who has discovered this bug?This problem intensifies as we go into more detailed tutorials. Due to the length of the articles, it is necessary for us authors to skip the tiny details, that unfortunately, newbies have a hard time figuring out.Problem #3: Error: Context not definedPhoto by Markus Spiske on UnsplashWe all follow articles differently, using different Operating Systems, different code-editors, different browsers, and whatnot.This makes it hard for an author to cover all the edge cases in which something might fail.Even if an author is able to cover all the edge cases today, as the things change frequently, there is a high chance that your code examples will not live long, even after you devoted a lot of time checking all the edge cases.Problem #4: Articles != Roller CoastersPhoto by 2Photo Pots on UnsplashDeveloper tutorials can be lengthy. Painfully lengthy.As responsible authors, most of us try to make our articles fun and engaging, with all the memes and movie references, some of which make no sense if you haven\u2019t seen the particular movie.Also, it\u2019s hard to introduce gamification in your articles using the current platforms.Due to this, a lot the readers, prefer to find the TL;DR sayingHere is the Github repo to containing all the code\u2026rather than going through the whole article.Not organizing the content of your tutorials properly leads to a lot of redirection to Github repos. This is good for your GitHub projects, but not for your articles.By the way, as I mostly write about Web 3.0, all these above problems just get worse for me.As Web 3.0 is a new community, the things break frequently, making my articles even more short-lived. There is a lot of uneven distribution of the audience when it comes to experience. The learning curve of Web 3.0 makes this even worse.The significance of context matters more than ever here, as most of the libraries are selectively supported for a few OS/browsers.And when you think your problems are over, the length of the article becomes so long (due to the learning curve and setting up the requirements) that it\u2019s even hard for me to read it in one go, let alone my audience.I tried to find something that may help me tackle these problems. But no luck.So, when I started my SimpleAsWater to make development & learning easier on Web 3.0, I pledged to also build a story-telling platform that is focused on the needs of the developers.We are going to start a private BETA testing for our developer-centric storytelling platform in the coming weeks. You can apply to be our first 100 people who will test out the platform.Register for BETA Testing \u2014 SimpleAsWaterSimpleAsWater, a Community Platform to Learn, Build, Collaborate & Discover Dapps and Web 3.0 Stories.simpleaswater.comMeanwhile, Let me show you a few sneak-peeks of what we are building.Solution #1: Applying CI/CD to your ArticlesCI/CD is the de-facto standard in software development when comes to code maintenance. For us developers, code examples are one of the most important parts of the article. Then why not do CI/CD for your articles?This seems really complex. But we are here to make it simple.We do regular CI tests on your code examples to make sure that they are still alive. If we find something fishy, we will mail you with the details of what is broken.This makes it simple for everyone to maintain your articles.Solution #2: How about asking for help from others?Today, if we are stuck somewhere while reading an article, we usually drop a comment asking for some help. Your comment can easily get lost in the multitude of \u201cthank you\u201d comments.So, we are introducing a \u201chelp\u201d comment which will be highlighted to every reader who is reading the same section of the article. This, way your doubts can be discovered easily.When the doubt is solved, the help comment and the chosen answer are recorded. Whenever someone is asking for help in the same section, he/she can be shown the previous \u201chelp\u201d comments, that can be similar to what he/she wants to ask.Solution #3: Articles = Git repositoriesMost of the articles don\u2019t stay active for a long time. So does your untracked code.We treat your articles as public git repositories, where people can add issues and submit PR(s).Sounds complex? Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s all going to be under the hood.This will help authors to engage more easily with the audience and provides the audience with an ability to help the author to maintain their articles.Plus it makes it easy for us to do CI/CD of your articles.Solution #4: Defining a ContextRather than everyone following a different path(using a different OS, browsers to run code), we try to put everyone on the same page.We do this by providing an in-built code-editor. Basically, you can embed a live VS Code editor in your articles, where everyone can try out the same code in the same environment.VS Code Powered ArticlesSolution #5: In-built Gamification & Entertainment SupportOne of the biggest parts of making your content engaging and fun is organizing & displaying your content in a good way.So, apart from adding support for built-in memes, we are providing what we call \u201cSteppers\u201d.Here are a few examples of how they look.Horizontal \u201cStepper\u201dUsing \u201cSteppers\u201d you cannot only organize your content but also choose to lock the parts of an article which will be unlocked only if you complete a specific part.You can also add an option for passing a step in case someone is just interested in a specific part of your tutorial.Vertical \u201cStepper\u201dYou can also choose to make your \u201cStepper\u201d vertical.Mobile \u201cStepper\u201dWe also got you covered for the mobile audience.There are many more customizable options available. Be sure to signup for the BETA Testing if you want to see this in action ASAP.Solution #6: Keeping it SimpleWe have mentioned a lot of features. This may lead you to askWill all this not make it too complex to write the articles?That\u2019s totally obvious.But as it\u2019s our motto at SimpleAsWater to make things easier, not harder.We are working on an intuitive UI/UX that will extract all the complexities of the process, that will make your experience of writing articles SimpleAsWater.Solution #7: Suggestions?Let us know if you have any ideas/suggestions here.Suggestions \u2014 SimpleAsWaterSimpleAsWater, a Community Platform to Learn, Build, Collaborate & Discover Dapps and Web 3.0 Stories.simpleaswater.comHelp us to build a Strong CommunityWe can build anything we want, but it will be of no use we don\u2019t have a friendly community.Can\u2019t wait to see what you all write and the communities that will form!Thanks for reading.About the AuthorVaibhav Saini is a Co-Founder of TowardsBlockchain, an MIT Cambridge Innovation Center incubated startup.Want to learn more?

We had big ideas and were ready to take on the world.On a regular Saturday, while we were busy coding away, as usual, the market decided to also do its usual 2018 move \u2014 it crashed. We used to think $6,000 BTC was the floor, well, we could not be more wrong. Many of our favorite crypto companies had to do layoffs. Miners that we knew shut down their operations. And, many of our friends stopped talking about crypto altogether. This is generally not a good thing. It was truly a Saturday blue so we decided to play Exploding Kittens to relieve the tension. Yeah, we figured we should train ourselves to avoid getting rekt.But, then came the eureka moment\u2026We quickly realized that this game was so simple yet so fun and could also be applied to crypto. Instead of avoiding the explosion, we avoid getting rekt in the crypto market. Instead of different animal cards, we can apply crypto memes and all the wrong things that happened during the last bull run, for example, those dubious practices like announcing 1,000 of non-existed partnerships. You may survive by playing various cards or doing special actions, such as secretly relocating an exploding kitten card, just like how you would secretly relocate from the US (or China) to Malta.We quickly threw the game aside and started brainstorming. We want to make crypto fun again! Hours passed by, we were deep in the zone, making sure we have sourced the best crypto meme in the market. This can become a keepsake for everyone still believing and surviving the market crash.By the next morning, we printed the cards out and tested over ten multiple variations. Shitcoin Survivors was no longer an idea. It became a real game. It\u2019s a fun, fast-paced, crypto-themed card game you can play with your friends and family. The game is between 2\u20135 players and each player starts with 8 cards in their hands and a draw pile in the middle. The end goal is to NOT get rekt (a rekt card). Yep, just like real life.Excited for what we had created, we also learned a few key things along the way:The objective must be clearWe wanted Shitcoin Survivors to be fun AND funny. Thus, we made the cards easy to understand and relatable for most crypto people. These criteria prompted us to be laser-focused on the objective rather than our personal opinion of what is good and what is not. That means we couldn\u2019t make fun of any shitcoin because most people might not understand (surprising but true, not everyone owns shitcoins).It reminded us of design research philosophy, taking a customer point of view rather than our own when designing a product.Word matters (a lot)We came up with \u201cShitcoin Survivors\u201d name through a consensus vote, neither delegation nor staking required. To us, the name refers to both the actual crypto users who are still following the market and the actual winner of the game (last man standing style). However, this name does create a barrier to advertise the game. While \u201cshit\u201d does not offend us, it seems to offend the mainstream media and placement ads so we couldn\u2019t really advertise it as much as we\u2019d like. Mainstream media loves our idea but the name is frowned upon. Nonetheless, we doubt that it will for our crypto friends.Like real life, crypto is still frowned upon and faces a barrier to adoption. We think Web 3.0 is a good idea and the mainstream may be intrigued, but NOT everyone will support it. Thinking from a mainstream point of view is, therefore, important.Balancing the game is very difficultWe went through many iterative processes: printing the cards out manually, trying them out, going back to the drawing board, adjusting parameters, such as the number of cards, the effect of Regulator card, the effect of People card, etc.As with building a product, go-to-market is very difficult. There are many uncontrollable and external factors that influence how our ideas (and business) will pan out.Start small but have a way to scaleMany of us wonder why we decided to start with an actual physical card instead of an online game, like one of those 1,000 dapps on EOS and Tron. It comes down to both MVP and objective of the game.While we are confident in our meme-curating ability, we are not sure if the rest of the community will share a similar sense of humor. Building real online game will take a much longer time and resource to prove our point while designing actual cards and launching an Indiegogo campaign allow us to test our ideas within a matter of days.We also want this to be fun and there is a reason why board game is still popular \u2014 the human interaction, the laugh and the inside joke make this game 100x better than playing in on a screen with a random dude on the other side of the world. We figure we can build an online game if this really becomes popular.This sounds remarkably like how we should approach our crypto solution. Instead of spending millions of dollar and years trying to build a breakthrough solution (and delay your listing, ahem), maybe all we need is a small incremental solution that we can iterate on. #shipordieArmed with the learnings, we no longer felt blue and were ready to continue grinding on Band Protocol. Creating this game makes crypto fun for us at least and we hope to share it with you and the community too. After all, we\u2019re all iterating and finding ways to bring crypto to the real world.Give it a spin and do share it with your friends! #nomorebear", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Cryptocurrency", "Bitcoin", "Ethereum", "Blockchain", "Crypto"]}, {"title": "Essentia Web Windows Installation Guide", "post_link": "https://medium.com/essentia_one/essentia-web-windows-installation-guide-480f418ad514?source=search_post", "author_name": "Matteo Gianpietro Zago", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@matteozago", "publish_date": "2018-08-31", "last_modified_date": "2018-09-03", "readtime": "2.97", "claps": 1, "voters": 1, "content": "Essentia Web Windows Installation GuideMatteo Gianpietro ZagoFollowAug 31, 2018 \u00b7 3 min readNow you can have the Web 3.0 at your fingertips with the release of Essentia desktop application!

In relation to Europe, IDC has reported that the European Blockchain spending and adoption will grow to $3.5 Billion by 2022.So given all such forecasts and the associated business opportunities, a number of companies have started to investigate how they can leverage the Blockchain technology in order to modernize, transform or even disrupt their business models.Beyond the business aspects of Blockchain, the technology itself is somehow complex. There are many open-source options that can support a Blockchain solution, however they are hard to operate so the consideration of a Blockchain as a Service (BaaS) platform is a strategy that makes sense as it can help a business to accelerate its Blockchain strategy and the solutions required by its business vertical and specific market niche.Companies need not only understand how Blockchain works but also select the right Blockchain technologies, networks and platforms in order to achieve the required results. The underlying IT governance required by a Blockchain solution is comprised by many different software, cloud and DevOps components and not only that, non-functional requirements such as interoperability and integration are real challenges, not to mention that security is critical requirement. So the right platform choice is a mandatory and crucial step in order to have solutions that result in successful implementations of Blockchain technology.Oracle has a BaaS service as part of its cloud PaaS services \u2014 the Oracle Blockchain Cloud Service.The Oracle Blockchain Cloud Service is an enterprise grade, pre-assembled, open and open standards based Blockchain platform. Its underlying framework is based on Hyperledger Fabric, a project that has been developed under the Linux Foundation umbrella.Oracle is offering a rock solid BaaS platform, where all the underlying platform and IT governance complexities including security, backups, failover, high-availability, decentralization, consolidation of metrics and monitoring among many enterprise features and other non-functional requirements are properly addressed as required. So the Oracle Blockchain Cloud Service is the perfect PaaS service and platform required for your successful Blockchain adoption efforts and strategy aligned with the common requirements of enterprise, B2B Blockchain systems.I strongly advise you to get more information about the Oracle Blockchain Service by checking the links below. With such resources you will be able to fully understand the Blockchain related benefits and the big picture of it as aligned with the requirements of B2B solutions.In the next blog posts, you\u2019ll have a series called Blockchain App Development Series, where I\u2019ll explain the technical aspects and advantages of our Oracle Blockchain Cloud Service in detail, how to create your Blockchain network, configure it, deploy and instantiate your smart contracts (also known as chaincodes in Hyperledger\u2019s terminology).Transforming the Enterprise with Oracle Blockchain Cloud ServiceOracle Blockchain Cloud Service11 Things to Know about Oracle Blockchain Cloud ServiceRethink Trust 2018: Joost Volker, Making Enterprise Blockchain a RealityOracle Launches Enterprise-Grade Blockchain Cloud ServiceGive it a try!

We all want to read more and learn more, but our days aren\u2019t getting longer and the noise is getting louder. Not only are we drowning in content, but even the good stuff buries the lede.

From \u201cContent Consumption is Obsolete\u201d:The killer products and services were once those that procured scarce content for us; the killer apps now are those that filter abundant content for us.

Facebook changed the entire character of the Internet on April 21, 2010. Come on! A little \u201clike\u201d button? What could be more trivial?Let me explain. Before 4/21/10 there was Facebook. And there was the web. They did not intersect. Oh, sure, you could use your Facebook credentials to log on to other websites. But that was it. On Facebook there was a parallel universe of applications. All living in the Facebook walled garden, and all playing by the Facebook rules \u2014 which insiders know changed mercurially seemingly every Tuesday.Everyone within your circle of friends could know what you did on Facebook. What you liked. What you were a fan of. What games you played and who your friends were. But they didn\u2019t know what you did outside of Facebook. Out there in the Wild Wild Web. That is unless you loved an article or website or product so much that you took the time and trouble to post a link and a comment in your status feed. And many of us did that. But not most of us. And not that often.But today everything is different. Facebook tore down the walls of its own walled garden. In so doing it marginalized most Facebook apps. As to the rest, well, it rendered them irrelevant. Why would I want an App that existed only within the walls of Facebook, where I had to live and die by the Facebook rules and Terms of Service, when now I could host my app outside of Facebook, under my own rules, yet still embed the social graph of my users within Facebook?This announcement is big. Really big. In essence, every website is now, potentially, a Facebook App. One that can overlay your activity on their website with your activity on Facebook, with perhaps some day your activity on other websites. Every website is now social. And every website can now go viral. All with a little \u201cLike\u201d button.Look at the Washington Post for example, which implemented the Facebook sharing feature the day of the announcement:Notice the upper right corner where I can see the Washington Post articles that are the most popular overall AND those articles that are most popular within my circle of friends\u2026.And if I look at those most popular articles, a few dozen of them show up in a list as you can see below. Very interesting. Sort of like Digg on every site. But without Digg\u2026\u2026I don\u2019t think I would be happy if I were Digg. Or Reddit\u2026..Change like this is disruptive. But in disruption comes opportunity for entrepreneurs.Some questions that come to mind: Is this good or bad for Twitter? Could this be like an organ transplant for MySpace? Will traditional media companies embrace this? How will the media company trend to create their own walled gardens, behind their own toll booths, play with Facebook? Will I be overwhelmed with thousands of \u201cI like\u201d status updates? How do I find what matters in my status feed? How can I aggregate \u201clikes\u201d from my friends and see the top things my friends like?Lots of questions mean lots of opportunities for entrepreneurs\u2026..PS\u2026.a memo to Congress. Hands off Facebook. If you don\u2019t use it, don\u2019t try to restrict it or outlaw it. And no, it doesn\u2019t count if your STAFF uses Facebook for you.

However, networking alone cannot provide all the resources needed for modern internet applications. That is why, we at NKN have strategically partnered with companies in key areas to collaborate and bring together all the elements needed for developers to build fully decentralized applications.To host a service in the cloud today, you need networking, compute, and storage capabilities and decentralized infrastructure is no different. For compute, we have recently partnered with Ankr, a company that provides cloud compute using idle processing power from data centers and edge devices. We are also partnering with Taxa to bring together decentralized network and trusted compute (TEE) to enable a new breed of high-performance, trustless applications and services.In the area of storage, we collaborate with bluzelle, a key-value database storage for serverless and distributed applications. In fact, you have probably seen our original D-chat application and presentation which was built in collaboration with bluzelle. In addition, we are in various phases of discussion with several other blockchain projects that cover file systems to block storage. However, these are not the only infrastructure companies and we have plans to include more partners soon.NKN\u2019s core algorithm was designed to scale to millions of nodes, and our data transmission is entirely off chain. We have also implemented nanoPay as a unique payment channel solution for video streaming type of services. To further improve TPS performance, we can use state of the art layer 1 and layer 2 scaling solutions. For example, we partner with Harmony, who take a holistic approach by incorporating sharding and other techniques at different levels of the stack for scalability.While Infrastructure and scalability is necessary as an enabler, it is the applications themselves that will ultimately attract enterprises and consumers. NKN will develop a few of our own flagship applications, such as nCDN and secure Pub/Sub messaging, that will showcase the capabilities of the NKN\u2019s network. However, the long term goal is to encourage our developer community and partner companies to create applications and develop a thriving ecosystem around our platform. We have already developed partnerships in verticals such as IoT (Nokia and IoTex), AI/ML (DxChain), Content (U Network), Name services (Portal Network), and Crypto wallet (O3).NKN is also quite selective in which projects to partner. There are too many partnerships in the crypto space that lack substance and relevance, thus the word \u201cpartnership\u201d has been diluted in value. We try to build collaborations that have actual mutual benefits, know the other team\u2019s personnel and technology well, and act on concrete next steps.With NKN\u2019s mainnet launched and network growing, it is now time to focus our attention on the next phase of evolution and build products that we can bring to market. We may choose to build some of these ourselves, such as the case with nCDN and secure Pub/Sub messaging, and in other cases we will rely on the resources of our partners. This is why NKN will continue to collaborate with partner companies to create new solutions and business opportunities for both NKN and our ecosystem.If you think your business fits in our partner ecosystem map, please contact us at: contact@nkn.orgAbout NKNNKN is the new kind of P2P network connectivity protocol & ecosystem powered by a novel public blockchain. We use economic incentives to motivate Internet users to share network connection and utilize unused bandwidth. NKN\u2019s open, efficient, and robust networking infrastructure enables application developers to build the decentralized Internet so everyone can enjoy secure, low cost, and universally accessible connectivity.Home: https://nkn.org/Email: contact@nkn.orgTelegram: https://t.me/nknorgTwitter: https://twitter.com/NKN_ORGForum: https://forum.nkn.orgMedium: https://medium.com/nknetworkLinkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/company/nknetwork/Github: https://github.com/nknorgDiscord: https://discord.gg/yVCWmkCYouTube: http://www.youtube.com/c/NKNORG", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Marcom", "Biz", "Partnerships"]}, {"title": "A Gentle Introduction to Ethereum Programming, Part 1", "post_link": "https://medium.com/zeppelin-blog/a-gentle-introduction-to-ethereum-programming-part-1-783cc7796094?source=search_post", "author_name": "Facu Spagnuolo", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@facuspagnuolo", "publish_date": "2017-11-14", "last_modified_date": "2019-02-13", "readtime": "5.44", "claps": 1615, "voters": 290, "content": "A Gentle Introduction to Ethereum Programming, Part 1Facu SpagnuoloFollowNov 14, 2017 \u00b7 6 min readTwo months ago I was asked to build an Ethereum web application as a work test to join Zeppelin, but I didn\u2019t have any idea about blockchain technology at all. I had barely heard of Bitcoin, so there was no other option but to dive in.This will be a series of posts aimed at software developers who want to ramp up to Ethereum. Please keep in mind that I do not consider myself an expert in this subject, I\u2019d just like to teach you what I learned and save you some time if you are in the same place I was. By the end of the series you should be able to build a fully-fledged smart-contract-enabled web application (also known as DApp) on your own!Enjoy, and please do not hesitate to reach out with questions, suggestions or feedback.Index1. Taking the first steps1.1. Introduction1.2. Web32. Interacting with a contract3. Frameworks & Tools in the real world4. A real DApp, a token marketplace \u2014 coming soon1. Taking the first steps1.1. IntroductionI\u2019ll assume you have some basic knowledge about computer programming and what a blockchain data structure looks like. If you don\u2019t, please follow this link and come back!EthereumLet\u2019s start by defining Ethereum, or at least, what I understood about it after my research. Ethereum is an open-source public platform, distributed and based on blockchain technology, to run applications without censorship or third-party interference.Smart ContractsSmart contracts are just computer programs. We build Ethereum applications based on smart contracts. Bear in mind that even though this concept comes up with Ethereum these days, it was actually proposed by Nick Szabo in 1996 :)Ethereum Virtual MachineThe EVM is the sandboxed runtime and completely isolated environment for smart contracts in Ethereum. This means every smart contract running inside the EVM has no access to network, file system or other processes.GasGiven that Ethereum is a distributed platform, there must be a way to limit the resources available to a given smart contract, otherwise it could starve the whole network\u2019s computing power. Gas solves that issue by fixing a cost for every instruction executed in the EVM. One important thing, is that every transaction is sent to the network with a \u201cgas budget\u201d. If it runs out, the transaction will fail but still gets mined into the blockchain.Ether (ETH)It is the Ethereum cryptocurrency token. There is a gas/Ether dynamic price that measures how much ETH will an operation cost. The fee paid to execute a transaction is calculated by multiplying the gas cost and the gas price (the resulting fee is paid in ETH). You can set the gas price for your transaction to any value. However, if the gas price is too low, no one is going to execute your code.AccountsEvery account is identified by an address. There are two kinds of accounts sharing the same address space. On one hand, we have external accounts controlled by public-private key pairs, commonly owned by people to store ETH. On the other hand, we have contract accounts that are controlled by the code that it\u2019s stored with it. These have a few differences, but one very important to have in mind, is that only external accounts can initiate transactions.TransactionsA transaction is a message sent from one account to another account. You can send a transaction to another external account in order to transfer ETH. If the target account is a contract account, its code will be executed as well. Note that every transaction that involves code execution will be executed on all nodes of the network. Furthermore, every code run, or transaction execution, will be recorded in the Ethereum blockchain.SoliditySolidity is a contract-oriented high-level language, with similar syntax to JavaScript. It is statically typed, supports inheritance, libraries and complex user-defined types. It compiles to EVM assembly, which is run by the nodes.1.2. Web3I decided to start interacting with the Ethereum blockchain, by first simply sending ETH from one account to another. I didn\u2019t want to do it with real ETH since I was probably going to make a mess, so I started looking for some testing/fake environment. Reading Manu\u2019s amazing post I found testrpc, that is a node.js Ethereum client for testing and development. Let\u2019s install it and start playing with it:npm install -g ethereumjs-testrpctestrpcYou will notice that testrpc has generated 10 addresses with fake ETH you can use without the need to worry about them. This is how testrpc works by default, but you can make a custom initialization following the documentation. It\u2019s important to mention that testrp state is volatile, that is every time you close it, the state of your node and accounts will be cleared.The next thing you should get to know is Web3.js. It is a JavaScript library that implements the Ethereum JSON RPC. That is, the protocol that we will use to talk to an Ethereum node (in this case, testrpc). To install it, just run:npm install -g web3@0.20.1BTW, it is important to install a Web3 0.20.x version, but not the 1.0.0 beta for this exercise. First of all, you need to connect Web3 with your local testing node you are running with testrpc. In order to do that, we will ask Web3 to use a localhost provider. Let\u2019s open a node console and input following lines:Web3 = require('web3')provider = new Web3.providers.HttpProvider(\"http://localhost:8545\")web3 = new Web3(provider)Please note that we are using the default testrpc port (8545), if you set another one remember to change the provider URL too. Once you have your web3 instance, start by getting the list of accounts you have in your Ethereum node, with their respective balance, by running the following:web3.eth.accounts.forEach(account => {  balance = web3.eth.getBalance(account);  console.log(balance);})You probably noticed that the output is not exactly a list of numbers, that\u2019s because Web3 uses BigNumber objects for number values, since JavaScript is not able to handle big numbers correctly. You can read more about this here.You should also know that those balances are not expressed in ETH, actually those are wei values, the base unit. 1 ETH is 10\u00b9\u2078 wei. Please follow the Ethereum documentation to see more about ETH conversions.Returning to what we were saying, let\u2019s try to send ETH between two accounts. Just type web3.eth.accounts and pick two of those. Then you can use the sendTransaction method:from = web3.eth.accounts[0]to = web3.eth.accounts[1]transaction = { from: from, to: to, value: 100000 }transactionHash = web3.eth.sendTransaction(transaction)That output is the transaction hash, and you can get the transaction information with it:web3.eth.getTransaction(transactionHash)You may also want to check that the balances of the accounts that you used have changed. You can validate that with the next commands:web3.eth.accounts.forEach(account => {  balance = web3.eth.getBalance(account);  console.log(balance);})Next, I built a simple UI using HTML and jQuery with a little bit of Bootstrap just to make it pretty. You can take a look at it in my repo. This is what we call a DApp, or decentralised application. That is, an application where part of the backend code runs on a decentralized peer-to-peer network; in this case, the Ethereum network.UI of the DApp that I built to test ETH transfersYou will find an index.html file for the UI, and an app.js file hosting the interaction with the Ethereum node, that is basically what we described above in conjunction with some jQuery callbacks to populate the UI. Please feel free to clone my repo and give it a try.Thank you for reading this post, please remember that any question, feedback or suggestions are welcome!

This post is then valid and was tested for both geth 1.7.3 and geth 1.8. Awesome :)I\u2019ve learned a posteriori that the gas limit per block is dynamic. Therefore I\u2019ve updated the section 2.3 to give more information about this particular case. In my private network where blocks are most of the time empty, I don\u2019t what the gas limit to decrease at all !Clique requires int(N/2+1) sealers (where N is the number of sealers defined in the genesis file \u2014 in extraData field) to be online in order to run.thx to Ivica Aracic for pointing out that clique PoA DOES WORK with a single node. For any reason I missed that and I apologize for the confusion. With a single node, we just need (A) create genesis file with only one sealer (only 1 address in extraData ) (B) create an account (C) init geth (D) run geth, unlock account and mine. No bootnode is required then.with geth 1.8 if you get the error \u201cinvalid host specified\u201d, try adding the option --rpcvhosts value to the geth command. See geth --helpGoal: step by step guide to help you setup a local private ethereum network using the Proof-of-Authority consensus engine (also named clique).In a nutshell: we will setup two nodes on the same machine, creating a peer-to-peer network on our localhost. In addition to the two nodes, a bootnode (discovery service) will also be setup.It took me quite some time and extensive research and googling to finally have a solid ethereum development environment for testing my smart contracts and my DApps.In this post, I\u2019ve decided to share how I am setting a Proof-of-Authority network using the clique consensus engine of Geth. It\u2019s my way to thank the community by giving back and hopefully making life easier for anyone willing exploring the Ethereum universe.OS and SoftwareMy OS is Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (this tuto was done in a fresh virtual machine).For the Ethereum client, I am using Geth (the Go implementation of the Ethereum protocole). I believe that Geth is easy to install with plenty of great tutorials out there, so I am not gonna cover any installation here.

You\u2019re gonna need it. A lot.1. Let\u2019s get started1.0 overviewLet\u2019s start by the end\u2026 For clarity, this is what you are supposed to get when you will have completed Chapter 1.devnet$ tree -L 2.\u251c\u2500\u2500 accounts.txt\u251c\u2500\u2500 boot.key\u251c\u2500\u2500 genesis.json\u251c\u2500\u2500 node1\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 geth\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 keystore\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 password.txt\u2514\u2500\u2500 node2    \u251c\u2500\u2500 geth    \u251c\u2500\u2500 keystore    \u2514\u2500\u2500 password.txt1.1 create a workspace$ mkdir devnet$ cd devnetdevnet$ mkdir node1 node21.2 create your accountsThe accounts (also called wallet) hold a private-public key pair that are required for interacting with any blockchain. Any mining node (strictly speaking our nodes will not be mining but voting) needs to be able to sign transactions (using their private key) and to identify itself on the network (the address is derived from the public key). Therefore we need at least two accounts, one per node.In Geth jargon, a voting node is called a Sealer.for node 1 :devnet$ geth --datadir node1/ account newYour new account is locked with a password. Please give a password. Do not forget this password.Passphrase: pwdnode1 (for example)Repeat passphrase: pwdnode1Address: {87366ef81db496edd0ea2055ca605e8686eec1e6}for node 2 :devnet$ geth --datadir node2/ account newYour new account is locked with a password.

Do not forget this password.Passphrase: pwdnode2 (for example)Repeat passphrase: pwdnode2Address: {08a58f09194e403d02a1928a7bf78646cfc260b0}This creates the keystore/ folder containing your account file. Notice that the last part of the file name in keystore/ is the address of your account (also printed in the terminal just above).I suggest to copy these two addresses from the terminal screen and to save them in a text file. That will ease some copy-pasting job later on. However remember that you can read those addesses from the UTC-datetime-address file in keystore/.devnet$ echo '87366ef81db496edd0ea2055ca605e8686eec1e6' >> accounts.txtdevnet$ echo '08a58f09194e403d02a1928a7bf78646cfc260b0' >> accounts.txtFor each node, I propose to save your password in a file. That will ease some process for later on (such as unlocking your account)devnet$ echo 'pwdnode1' > node1/password.txtdevnet$ echo 'pwdnode2' > node2/password.txt1.3 create your Genesis fileA genesis file is the file used to initialize the blockchain. The very first block, called the genesis block, is crafted based on the parameters in the genesis.json file.Geth comes with a bunch of exectuables such as puppeth or bootnode . You can find the complete list on the Geth github. Puppeth removes the pain of creating a genesis file from scratch (and does much more). Start puppeth :devnet$ puppethand happily answer the questions (every value can be updated by hand later on, so don\u2019t spent too much time engineering it for your first trials).Please specify a network name to administer (no spaces, please)> devnetWhat would you like to do?

Deploy network components> ^C // ctrl+C to quit puppethSide note : from Clique PoA EIP#225PoA doesn\u2019t have mining rewardsSo I would highly suggest that you allocate some ethers (defined in the unit of wei) to a bunch of addresses in the genesis file, otherwise you\u2019ll hand up without any ether and thus will not be able to pay for your transactions. You could have a gasPrice of zero but that sometimes leads to undesired behavior from the nodes that could go under the radar (like not broadcasting pending transaction depending on the config of the other nodes on the network). I encourage you nevertheless to play with every parameter :)1.4 Initialize your nodesNow that we have the genesis.json file, let\u2019s forge the genesis block ! Each node MUST be initialize with the SAME genesis file.devnet$ geth --datadir node1/ init genesis.jsondevnet$ geth --datadir node2/ init genesis.jsontada ! done.Side note : how does your node know about the genesis parameters when joining the Ethereum Mainnet or the Ropsten testnet, or the Rinkeby testnet ? They are already defined in the source code in params/config.go.1.5 Create a bootnodeA bootnode only purpose is to helping nodes discovering each others (remember, the Ethereum blockchain is a peer-to-peer network). Nodes could have dynamic IP, being turned off, and on again. The bootnode is usually ran on a static IP and thus acts like a pub where nodes know they will find their mates.Initialize the bootnode :devnet$ bootnode -genkey boot.keyThis creates a value called the enode uniquely identifying your bootnode (more on this soon) and we store this enode in the boot.key file.1.6 Midway celebrationCongrats ! Chapter 1 is done :) trydevnet$ tree -L 2and compare the output with the section 1.0. Hopefully you should get the same tree.At this point the setup is done and we are ready to make this blockchain live.2. Make it live2.1 Start the bootnode servicedevnet$ bootnode -nodekey boot.key -verbosity 9 -addr :30310INFO [02-07|22:44:09] UDP listener up                          self=enode://3ec4fef2d726c2c01f16f0a0030f15dd5a81e274067af2b2157cafbf76aa79fa9c0be52c6664e80cc5b08162ede53279bd70ee10d024fe86613b0b09e1106c40@[::]:30310I like to have some verbosity for my bootnode as it is nice to see when the nodes are playing ping-pong on the network (meaning it\u2019s working!).Feel free to use any port you like but please avoid the mainstream ones (like 80 for HTTP). 30303 is used for the public ethereum networks.2.2 Starting your nodesBig time ! Finally (but usually here the troubles arrive too).Everything in one huge command ! I am gonna cover some options but please do your homework and refer to the doc.starting node 1devnet$ geth --datadir node1/ --syncmode 'full' --port 30311 --rpc --rpcaddr 'localhost' --rpcport 8501 --rpcapi 'personal,db,eth,net,web3,txpool,miner' --bootnodes 'enode://3ec4fef2d726c2c01f16f0a0030f15dd5a81e274067af2b2157cafbf76aa79fa9c0be52c6664e80cc5b08162ede53279bd70ee10d024fe86613b0b09e1106c40@127.0.0.1:30310' --networkid 1515 --gasprice '1' -unlock '0x87366ef81db496edd0ea2055ca605e8686eec1e6' --password node1/password.txt --mine--syncmode 'full' helps preventing the error Discarded Bad Propagated Block.--port 30311 is the enode port for node1 and has to be different from the bootnode port (that is 30310 if you followed my command) because we are on a localhost. On a real network (one node per machine), use the same port.--rpcapi allows the listed modules to be used over RPC calls (see section 3.3 for an example). See the Geth Management APIs for more info. Be mindful about hacks as everyone can call your RPC methods if no firewall is protecting your node.--bootnodes tells your node at what address to find your bootnode. Replace [::] with the bootnode IP. No domain name are allowed ! Only IPs. Check enode URL format.--networkId as defined in the genesis.json file. Please use the same id !--gasprice '1' I don\u2019t like to pay on my own network :) be careful with gasprice. If your transactions are not being broadcasted to the network but only the node receiving the transactions is processing them, this means you sent a transaction with a gasprice that is not accepted (too low) by the other nodes on the network. No error will be return. If you have two nodes, only one will be processing the transactions. This is sneaky and reduces your network throughput by a factor 2.--unlock --password --mine tell the node to unlock this account, with the password in that file and to start mining (i.e. voting/sealing for Proof-of-Authority)--targetgaslimit value see the update in section 2.3.same for node 2 (update parameters specific to the node)devnet$ geth --datadir node2/ --syncmode 'full' --port 30312 --rpc --rpcaddr 'localhost' --rpcport 8502 --rpcapi 'personal,db,eth,net,web3,txpool,miner' --bootnodes 'enode://3ec4fef2d726c2c01f16f0a0030f15dd5a81e274067af2b2157cafbf76aa79fa9c0be52c6664e80cc5b08162ede53279bd70ee10d024fe86613b0b09e1106c40@127.0.0.1:30310' --networkid 1515 --gasprice '0' --unlock '0x08a58f09194e403d02a1928a7bf78646cfc260b0' --password node2/password.txt --mineAt this point your bootnode should stream connections coming from node1 (port 30311) and node2 (port 30312) as shown in the upper terminal window. Node1 (middle terminal) and node2 (lower terminal) should be happily mining and signing blocks. Here I have a period of 1 second (defined in the genesis file) therefore the fast block creation.2.3 Update your genesis fileI am sure you\u2019ll want to modify some values in your genesis file. Go ahead ! However in order for those changes to become effective, we have to initialize a new blockchain. Here is the genesis file I am currently using :{    \"config\": {        \"chainId\": 1515,        \"homesteadBlock\": 1,        \"eip150Block\": 2,        \"eip150Hash\": \"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\",        \"eip155Block\": 3,        \"eip158Block\": 3,        \"byzantiumBlock\": 4,        \"clique\": {            \"period\": 1,            \"epoch\": 30000        }    },    \"nonce\": \"0x0\",    \"timestamp\": \"0x5a722c92\",    \"extraData\": \"0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000008a58f09194e403d02a1928a7bf78646cfc260b087366ef81db496edd0ea2055ca605e8686eec1e60000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\",    \"gasLimit\": \"0x59A5380\",    \"difficulty\": \"0x1\",    \"mixHash\": \"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\",    \"coinbase\": \"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000\",    \"alloc\": {        \"08a58f09194e403d02a1928a7bf78646cfc260b0\": {            \"balance\": \"0x200000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\"        },        \"87366ef81db496edd0ea2055ca605e8686eec1e6\": {            \"balance\": \"0x200000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\"        },        \"F464A67CA59606f0fFE159092FF2F474d69FD675\": {            \"balance\": \"0x200000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\"        }    },    \"number\": \"0x0\",    \"gasUsed\": \"0x0\",    \"parentHash\": \"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\"}I\u2019ve cleaned the empty addresses that puppeth includes when creating the file (at section 1.3). I\u2019ve also added a third address that gets funded when the genesis block is created. Then I have changed the period from 15 second to 1 to get those blocks mined faster (be careful as one empty block weights 1024 bytes \u2014 here my chaindata/ folder gains 1024 bytes per second (and more if the blocks are not empty). Finally I\u2019ve increased the gasLimit to allow for more transaction (trully speaking, computation) per block.update: The gasLimit defined in the genesis file only applies to the genesis block ! The gasLimit of new blocks is DYNAMIC meaning its value is changing over time depending on how much gas was used in the parent (previous) block. The computation of the new gasLimit is done in the function CalcGasLimit (github source). If you want a constant gas Limit use the option --targetgaslimit intValue when running geth. I would recommend to set it equal to the gasLimit in the genesis file (the command option is an integer whereas the genesis value is hexadecimal) so that you get a constant gas limit that does not change over time anymore. Given the genesis file above with \"gasLimit\":\"0x59A5380\" , I am running my node with --targetgaslimit 94000000 for a constant gas limit across all blocks.The field extraData contains the address that are allowed to seal (that\u2019s why puppeth is nice to have).I have investigate the impact of changing the period and the gasLimit on the number of transaction per second (transaction rate) that the blockchain can process. But that\u2019s gonna be another article; link here.When you are happy with your genesis file. Kill your nodes if they are running (ctrl C in the terminal). Then delete the folder geth/ in node1/ and geht/ in node2/ . Delete only geth/ folders!Then initialize your nodes. From section 1.4 :devnet$ geth --datadir node1/ init genesis.jsondevnet$ geth --datadir node2/ init genesis.jsonand start your nodes again with the commands in section 2.23. Interact with your nodesGreat your network is now live :) but how to connect to it and starting exploring ?3.1 Open a Geth Javascript ConsoleThe simplest and probably more straight forward way to play with a node is probably to attach a Geth javascript console to one of the nodes.3.1.1 Through IPCIPC (Inter-Process Communication) works only locally : you should be on the same machine as your node. Open an extra terminal and attach to your node. To connect to node1 :$ cd devnetdevnet$ geth attach node1/geth.ipcWelcome to the Geth JavaScript console!instance: Geth/v1.7.3-stable-4bb3c89d/linux-amd64/go1.9coinbase: 0x87366ef81db496edd0ea2055ca605e8686eec1e6at block: 901 (Sat, 10 Feb 2018 21:15:30 CET) datadir: /home/salanfe/privateNetworks/devnet/node1 modules: admin:1.0 clique:1.0 debug:1.0 eth:1.0 miner:1.0 net:1.0 personal:1.0 rpc:1.0 txpool:1.0 web3:1.0>The file geth.ipc is created only when the node is running. So do not expect to find it if your node1 is off.RPC gives access without restriction to all modules listed in the terminal : admin: 1.0 clique:1.0 debug:1.0 eth:1.0 miner:1.0 net:1.0 personal:1.0 rpc:1.0 txpool:1.0 web3:1.03.1.2 Through RPCRPC (Remote Procedure Call) works over the internet as HTTP requests. Therefore be careful when you open RPC to the outside world as everyone will have access to your node. For this reason RPC is disabled by default and when enabled it does not give access to all modules. In this guide we allowed RPC on our Geth node with the command --rpc and gave access to the modules personal,db,eth,net,web3,txpool,miner (from section 2.2). To connect to node1 using RPC :$ cd devnetdevnet$ geth attach 'http://localhost:8501'Welcome to the Geth JavaScript console!instance: Geth/v1.7.3-stable-4bb3c89d/linux-amd64/go1.9coinbase: 0x87366ef81db496edd0ea2055ca605e8686eec1e6at block: 945 (Sat, 10 Feb 2018 21:16:14 CET) modules: eth:1.0 miner:1.0 net:1.0 personal:1.0 rpc:1.0 txpool:1.0 web3:1.0>3.1.3 Using the Geth Javascript ConsoleHere are some examples of methods> net.version\"1515\"> eth.blockNumber1910> eth.coinbase\"0x87366ef81db496edd0ea2055ca605e8686eec1e6\"> eth.sendTransaction({'from':eth.coinbase, 'to':'0x08a58f09194e403d02a1928a7bf78646cfc260b0', 'value':web3.toWei(3, 'ether')})\"0x299a99baa1b39bdee5f02e3c660e19e744f81c2e886b5fc24aa83f92fe100d3f\"> eth.getTransactionReceipt(\"0x299a99baa1b39bdee5f02e3c660e19e744f81c2e886b5fc24aa83f92fe100d3f\"){  blockHash: \"0x212fb593980bd42fcaf3f6d1e6db2dd86d3764df8cac2d90408f481ae7830de8\",  blockNumber: 2079,  contractAddress: null,  cumulativeGasUsed: 21000,  from: \"0x87366ef81db496edd0ea2055ca605e8686eec1e6\",  gasUsed: 21000,  logs: [],  logsBloom: \"0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\",  status: \"0x1\",  to: \"0x08a58f09194e403d02a1928a7bf78646cfc260b0\",  transactionHash: \"0x299a99baa1b39bdee5f02e3c660e19e744f81c2e886b5fc24aa83f92fe100d3f\",  transactionIndex: 0}> exit // to quit the Geth javascript consolefor the full list of methods, see Management APIs and JSON RPC API.3.2 Using MistThe Mist browser provides a graphical user interface for deploying and interacting with smart contracts and managing accounts. To connect Mist to your local private network over IPC, simply do :devnet$ mist --rpc node1/geth.ipcand over RPC (make sure RPC is enabled)$ mist --rpc 'http://localhost:8501'The procedure is exactly the same if you want to use the Ethereum wallet instead of mist. Just replace mist by ethereumwallet in the commands above.3.3 Making RPC calls with your favorite programming languageIn section 3.1, we saw how to interact with the Geth API by hand. Now let\u2019s use our PC for what it is best at : automation.The reference and by far for sending JSON-RPC requests to your node is the web3.js javascript library. I believe the internet of full of great tutorial and example on how to use the web3.js library. Therefore I am not gonna covert any of it here.The JSON-RPC APIs are currently also being implemented in java with the web3.j library and in python with the web3.py library. Those libraries offer high-level methods for working with the ethereum blockchain just like web3.js.However, it\u2019s also possible to send raw JSON-RPC requests directly to your node. I think it is worth trying as it\u2019s providing a valuable understanding on how those high-level libraries work under the hood.Here is a simple example of sending a raw JSON-RPC request to my node using python 3 :$ pythonPython 3.6.4 |Anaconda custom (64-bit)| (default, Jan 16 2018, 18:10:19) [GCC 7.2.0] on linuxType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.>>> import requests>>> import json>>> session = requests.Session()>>> method = 'eth_getTransactionCount'>>> params = [\"0x627306090abaB3A6e1400e9345bC60c78a8BEf57\",\"latest\"]>>> PAYLOAD = {\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",...            \"method\":method,...            \"params\":params,...            \"id\":67}>>> PAYLOAD = json.dumps(PAYLOAD)>>> headers = {'Content-type': 'application/json'}>>> response = session.post('http://127.0.0.1:8501', data=PAYLOAD, headers=headers)>>> response.contentb'{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"id\":67,\"result\":\"0x0\"}\\n'>>> json.loads(response.content)['result']'0x0'The method geth_transactionCount is documented here.The \u201caccount\u201d nonce is a transaction counter and has nothing to do with the nonce for Proof-of-Work. A account nonce of zero means that the address 0x627306090abaB3A6e1400e9345bC60c78a8BEf57 never did any transaction on the network : 0x0 is the hexadecimal representation of zero.3.4 Deploy and test your smart contracts with Truffle on your private networkDevelopment frameworks like Truffle (or Embark, Populus) are great tools for developing and testing smart contracts.When you initialize a workspace with$ truffle initTruffle creates a series of files and folders to help you get started. I usually edit the truffle.js file as suchmodule.exports = {    // See <http://truffleframework.com/docs/advanced/configuration>    // to customize your Truffle configuration!    networks: {        devnet: {            host: '127.0.0.1',            port: 8501,            network_id: '*'        },        ganache: {            host: '127.0.0.1',            port: 7545,            network_id: '*'        }    }};then use the command$ truffle deploy --network devnetto deploy your smart contracts defined in migrations/X_deploy.js . Or for running your tests in test/$ truffle test --network devnetUsually the Ethereum Blockchain simulator Ganache is more than enough for running your tests. However I like to use my private blockchain for ultimate testing on a real node and not only on a simulator. With Ganache I believe that the layer of abstraction is too big, what is the beauty of it but also a danger as it requires no understanding what so ever of the complexity of a real node (transaction pool, gasPrice, gasLimit, broadcasting transactions between nodes, mining or voting, computation time, consensus engine, etc.).What\u2019s next ?That\u2019s pretty much it for this guide. If you understand everything here I believe you\u2019re already on very good tracks and you have a solid foundation on which you can continue your journey with confidence.You can start developing Dapps (Decentralized Applications) by grabbing a web3 library or by making your own custom JSON-RPC wrapper.In this post, I explore how to use python for deploying and transacting with a smart contract using only raw HTTP requests.Ethereum: create raw JSON-RPC requests with Python for deploying and transacting with a smart\u2026February 2018.medium.comFinal WordsCongratulation if you made it until the end.

It had a perfect start with the success of CryptoKitties, and explosive growth among similar DApps was highly anticipated.Fluence Labs aims to develop a decentralized network capable of carrying out real-time high-volume data processing for the emerging Web3. As an infrastructure project, we\u2019ve been curious what was happening in the DApp market. This research started as an attempt to contact the DApp developer community to dig into what\u2019s been going on.To approach this systematically, we have surveyed multiple DApp project developers and founders with the goal of separating facts from speculation and rumor to find out who they are, what they are up to, what challenges they\u2019re facing, and finally, how many active DApp projects there are and how hard it is to reach these apps.We believe that the insights discovered in the process can help not just us but everyone in the field to better understand the current state of DApps in terms of user adoption and available technology.Key insights:Despite harsh market conditions, the majority of projects surveyed were started in 2018.A quarter of the surveyed projects were gaming DApps.About half of the projects used a centralized cloud backend and centralized tools like Infura to connect to the Ethereum blockchain.Transactional fees prevailed as the central monetization model for most projects.New user onboarding was mentioned by more than three quarters of the respondents as the major obstacle to adoption.These findings might be of interest not only to developers working directly with Web3 tech but also to investors inside and outside the crypto space as well as anyone planning to start a DApp project who wants to learn about the challenges that might lie ahead.Some background knowledge of crypto inner workings and key terminology (public/private keys, Layer 1/2 blockchains, MetaMask, etc.) might be required for a better understanding of this report.This report is structured similarly to a production workflow. It starts with the inception and the choice of a technological platform, then goes into development obstacles, and in the end discusses adoption and business issues.For those of you who would like to dig for more information, we have also published the anonymized raw results.

Recipients should not construe the contents of this document as legal, tax, regulatory, financial or accounting advice and are urged to consult their own advisors in relation to such matters. The content of this document has been prepared purely for informational purposes. In all cases persons should conduct their own investigation and analysis of the data in the Document.1.1 DApp DefinitionTo construct this survey, we first had to define which projects should be considered DApps. The term \u201cDApp,\u201d which originated in the Ethereum community, can be applied to basically anything that has a smart contract as the key component. To reduce ambiguity, in this report we\u2019ve limited DApps to those applications that focus on the end user.Using this definition, we were able to aggregate a list of 1624 DApp projects. Of these, only 900 projects had either email, Telegram, or Discord available for contact; of those, 160 project spokespeople ultimately filled out the survey.1.2 Surveyed DApps ProfileDespite harsh market conditions, the majority of projects (72%) were started in 2018. Only 12.5% of surveyed projects were being run by a solo developer. The bulk of DApps had a team size between two and five (47.5%) or more than five developers (40%).2.1 Platforms (Layer 1 Blockchains)The majority of DApps used Ethereum (87%), with EOS ranking second (19%) and TRON ranking third (8%). Ten percent of surveyed projects were simultaneously building on more than one chain. Though we were quite curious about the state of DApps using other chains, we were unable to locate a statistically significant number of such projects.2.2 Technology StackThe majority of DApps used a web-based frontend, and almost half (48%) of surveyed DApp projects were relying on a traditional cloud to run their backend code.It should be noted that roughly the same number of DApps were using a decentralized storage solution like IPFS (32%) as were using a centralized CDN (31%). A similar proportion was found in respect to databases: 31% of DApps relied on a centralized database while 25% of DApps used a decentralized DB.Regarding the used technologies, React and Node.js took a significant lead, leaving behind other popular languages and frameworks. The list of mentioned databases included MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and MySQL, with MongoDB being mentioned most often.2.3 Centralized Parts of the StackMore than half of respondents mentioned that they have to use centralized infrastructure when developing their projects: 48% of surveyed DApps relied on a centralized backend, 31% used a centralized file storage, and 21% used authentication APIs such as Facebook Connect.3.1 Tool Quality and DocumentationGenerally, onboarding new developers is crucial in advancing the adoption of emerging technologies. Notwithstanding, DApp developers mentioned that tools and libraries used in the decentralized ecosystem were often unstable, not compatible with each other, poorly documented, and unpredictable in the way they worked.\u201cSolidity has a lot of \u2018gotchas\u2019 that can be catastrophic if you\u2019re not aware of them.\u201d \u2014 Anonymous\u201cLack of documentation for the blockchain clients is a big problem.\u201d \u2014 CryptoKube\u201cAngular and Ethereum libraries don\u2019t always play nicely together. Docker is great technology, but still can be tricky to get configured properly in a DevOps workflow. Lastly, interacting with the Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts is complex, both from a UX and technology perspective.\u201d \u2014 Emoon3.2 State of the NetworkOf respondents building Ethereum Dapps, 63% mentioned Infura as a means to connect to the Ethereum network. Developers pointed out that sometimes using multiple technologies to connect to the blockchain was required to keep the DApp state and user interface up to date. Among the reasons to use multiple technologies was the fact that connectivity issues and node stability might present a problem and affect overall DApp quality \u2014 having a negative impact on the end user experience.\u201cThe supernode [full node] is unstable \u2014 lots of issues with handling transactions\u201d \u2014 Anonymous\u201cGeth could not finish synchronisation for 4 weeks on a good machine\u201d \u2014 Alice\u201cMainnet [is] behaving differently than testnets.\u201d \u2014 FABG\u201cSlow. Huge hard drive space requirements.\u201d \u2014 Quick Blocks\u201cWeb3 injection delays, syncing delays between the blockchain and Infura. Users might already have the TX approved, but our server will take at least another minute before it actually shows up synced. Not a biggy once you get used to it. But real gamers are used to instant feedback and not a coffee break with each mouse click.\u201d \u2014 Chibi Fighters3.3 Event Tracking and Data QueryingRespondents indicated that retrieving data from a blockchain might present a challenge, especially when real-time performance is required. Some developers were even using in-house tools to track smart contract events and process incoming data.\u201cHandling a huge volume of RPC requests [is the most frustrating]. This is mostly solved now using an in-house Parity load balancer.\u201d \u2014 Local Ethereum\u201c[The most problematic part is] maintaining our DB of events \u2014 I think there should be a pay-as-you-go service for this sort of thing.\u201d \u2014 Known Origin\u201cSometimes the node is not very stable (especially 1.5 years ago we experienced outage problems) so we\u2019ve needed to develop our own middleware to track transactions.\u201d \u2014 Alice\u201cPolling events and checking block confirmations in a deterministic way are problematic.\u201d \u2014 Crypto Care4.1 AudienceWhile some audience data can be gathered by examining transactions sent to DApp smart contracts, not every interaction with a DApp has to involve a smart contract call. We directly asked developers about the number of users interacting with their applications because we expected them to have more accurate data derived from internally available analytics tools.Although 58% of DApps had less than 50 daily active users, 12% of projects reported having more than 500 daily active users.4.2 FundingDApps from 2017 were mainly self-funded (38%) or funded by token sales (31%); VC-invested projects accounted for only 24%. In 2018, the majority of DApp projects were still self-funded, with only a small portion receiving funds through token sales (10%) or VC investment (16%).In absolute numbers, however, the difference is not as striking: the number of token sales has slightly declined, whereas the amount of VC funding has slightly increased. The biggest difference between 2017 and 2018 is that the number of self-funded DApps has grown almost four times.4.3 MonetizationThe majority (55%) of respondents were planning to monetize via transactional fees. Other developers indicated plans to rely on subscriptions (16%) and ads (11%). Finally, a few answers suggested selling NFTs or staking Ethereum as a potential monetization model.Other mentioned business models include the following:\u201cDeploying a token for licensing our desktop client usage from users that generate profits through our DApp.\u201d \u2014 Kryptium\u201cIssuing an ERC-20 work token (like Augur or KEEP) that appreciates in value over time. Could change the token dynamics and set up separate entities that provide centralized services (that accrue revenue), but the main organization should remain feeless to not extract any rents.\u201d \u2014 Anonymous5.1 OnboardingWhen asked about adoption challenges, developers mentioned user onboarding as their biggest concern, with the limited crypto audience size being their second.Creating a wallet, getting coins, and explaining what gas is were mentioned among the aspects that developers found difficult to explain when they first reached out to their audiences.\u201cGetting them started with a wallet and explaining that they\u2019ll have to \u2018sign in\u2019 to that wallet using widely varying software, some of which has a high incidence of fraud and failure, and that they can\u2019t ever lose (or change!) that password or else they\u2019ll permanently lose access to everything \u2014 that\u2019s a hard sell without some seriously good onboarding tools.\u201d \u2014 Anonymous\u201cNew users don\u2019t understand how much gas they should set.\u201d \u2014 Riot Cats\u201cGetting them Ether is still the hardest challenge. The number of people who have Ether off of an exchange is tiny.\u201d \u2014 Daxia\u201cOnboarding. Once the wallet is set up and Ether is in hand, our experience is pretty easy to understand.\u201d \u2014 Anonymous\u201cIf even creating the wallet is too much hassle for developers, how can we expect less tech-savvy users to adopt crypto with the current awful UX?\u201d \u2014 FundRequest\u201cAt the moment, the steps of creating an EOS wallet are complicated. Besides, the concept of CPU usage time and RAM are difficult for normal people. These are the obstacles for people to play DApps.\u201d \u2014 DiceSome respondents working on Ethereum-based DApps reported that the MetaMask user experience could be improved. One of the mentioned reasons was that individually signing every transaction causes too much friction, especially for complex applications.\u201cFor the simple one-tab games, Metamask works fine. But complex games like Chibi Fighters that can be played in 10 tabs simultaneously make it pop all over the place.\u201d \u2014 Chibi Fighters\u201cHaving to sign every TX in Metamask.\u201d \u2014 FABG5.2 Figuring DApps and CryptoThe need to educate users who don\u2019t have a deep understanding of crypto was another issue mentioned by our respondents. One of the reported issues was that users were surprised to find that there is no \u201crestore my password\u201d option in crypto. Another problem area was that users don\u2019t always understand the difference between cryptocurrency, ERC20 tokens, and non-fungible tokens.\u201c[One thing we hadn\u2019t anticipated was that we would need to be] helping people understand that CryptoKitties are not a cryptocurrency.\u201d \u2014 CryptoKitties\u201c[The most unexpected obstacle is] that it [our DApp] is on the same platform as other DApps.\u201d \u2014 CryptoKitties City\u201cHowever, assuming that crypto is perfectly scalable to non-banked people in emerging economies, asking them to safely store their private keys is just too much.\u201d \u2014 Ethichub\u201cWe don\u2019t have [user] passwords and can\u2019t help recover their accounts.\u201d \u2014 Primas\u201dWe lack an OAuth2-style flow in which a user can sign up for the first time and port that [identity] to other platforms. This is the single biggest issue with Be Your Own Bank / IDentity Manager.\u201d \u2014 Anonymous6.1 ScalabilityTo address scalability concerns, the majority of surveyed developers were planning to handle their potentially growing user base with either Layer 2 or some other solution. However, 33% of DApp developers did not have a plan in place for how to scale if their Layer 1 platform was unable to handle their increased volumes.An existing Layer 2 platform was planned to use by 39% of respondents, while 27% planned to build their own.6.2 DecentralizationRespondents were quite optimistic about the use of decentralized computation and storage platforms as building blocks to achieve future scalability. However, around a quarter of developers were planning to use centralized hardware to perform intensive computations.That being said, 32% of respondents indicated that they might use a decentralized database service in the future as their primary data-storage solution, and 33% were thinking about using a decentralized file storage.One of the common beliefs in the blockchain ecosystem is that scalability is the first and major hurdle that any blockchain-based application will face. On the contrary, DApp developers responded that their biggest current pain points were \u201climited number of users\u201d (67%) and \u201cpoor user experience\u201d (44%). Although scalability limitations were only mentioned by 36% of the respondents, they might eventually become a priority once a project gathers a larger audience.We believe that several things could help to reduce the friction between DApps and their audiences:Deeper integrations between web browsers and crypto wallets. This could go both ways: browsers integrating with crypto wallets (for example, Opera is doing this right now) and wallets adding DApp browsers (see Status and Trust Wallet for Ethereum; and Token Pocket, Math Wallet, and Lynx for EOS).Emergence of new reusable cross-platform authentication and onboarding tools that provide a better UX on mobile, web, and desktop platforms (for example, Scatter or UniversalLogin).Wide adoption of solutions that remove gas costs for the end user (Loom network, Meta transactions).At Fluence, we\u2019re anxiously looking forward to the progress that will be made in 2019. The DApp ecosystem is something we are following closely and have a direct connection to as a blockchain infrastructure project. Over the coming year, we will be providing additional insights into our research.Thanks for getting this far!Please share your thoughts about this report (and what we can improve for next year) on our Discord!We had the opportunity to learn about lots of great projects, teams, and communities.

It is not based on blockchain technology. Nor is Holochain a single platform like Ethereum. It is rather like a decentralized Ruby on Rails, a toolkit that produces stand-alone programs but for serverless high-profile applications. Different from blockchain alternatives and as shown in this benchmark (based on the Holochain prototype), it actually works and performs better than Ethereum by several orders of magnitude.Although it is technically correct to call the things you create with Holochain applications, it seems to limit the imagination of people starting to apply Holochain because this term comes with baggage. I see a possible near-term future for the upcoming Holochain ecosystem, and I would like to share my vision with you and invite your participation and feedback!But before I start I want to clarify some things and introduce the philosophy behind the somewhat unique Holochain approach, as downloaded by the bright minds of Arthur Brock and Eric Harris-Braun. I don\u2019t intend to deliver a full explanation of Holochain in this post and rather refer to our whitepaper for an in-depth and formal discussion and to already working examples like Clutter, our fully distributed Twitter clone.Edit: For a quick (8min) explanation of Holochain, I\u2019ve just uploaded this video:But I do want to focus on the main paradigmatic shift that it represents and the benefits I see if we apply this new approach not only to the underlying architecture of the network itself and the means of providing a distributed data-integrity layer but also to building applications and UIs that fit the same model.Paradigm++TL;DR: Holochain introduces a paradigm-shift concerning the architecture of distributed applications. This is a long section and the central and rather pragmatic message of this post comes after. But if you haven\u2019t grokked yet what we mean by agent-centric computing and you\u2019re wary about our scalability claims and keep comparing Holochain to blockchain, this philosophical ex-course is for you.So the shift we are talking about is going from a data-centric to an agent-centric architecture. What does that mean?The common approach when modelling any kind of complex system through software is to implicitly assume some kind of omniscient perspective. The machine that runs the software is supposed to model facts. When data gets fed into the system we assume to know how something really is. Object oriented programming also carries the notion of being objective.As long as software runs only on one machine operated by one user, that makes perfect sense. You don\u2019t want the machine to have its own perspective on things\u2014 let alone a perspective different from yours. You want the machine\u2019s state to represent facts \u2014 correctly.Now, if we add other users to the mix \u2014 think multi-user mainframe computer with many terminals \u2014 the machine\u2019s objective perspective naturally serves as a surrogate for the objective physical reality we are used to. It is a space. If I put something in this space it stays there for you to find it. We can exchange data by writing to files located somewhere in the filesystem and could build applications based on this very principle of having a shared (cyber-) space that holds data. We assume the existence of data independent from our own existence as a user. In this scenario, data is the primitive thing that sits at the root of our ontology. If needed for certain use-cases, the concept of a user gets mapped onto this by having data represent users, i.e. a /etc/passwd file or a Users table.If we then add multiple machines to the scene it gets really interesting. Every computer creates its own virtual reality in which facts are modeled. Without further complexity or added means of communication, these realities do not magically mirror each other. They are intrinsically monadic. There is no objective layer that forces every computer\u2019s memory to be the same. Which actually makes it difficult to create distributed applications \u2014 software that runs on several machines and maintains its integrity and coherence of all parts in order to achieve its purpose.This, by the way, is a problem that does not get introduced by software nor computer networks. Everything I\u2019ve said above could have been said in almost the same way about how our human mind works. In order to enable us to interact with our environment in a meaningful and intelligent way, we have to model reality. We are taking in inputs as empirical experience and creating mental models that guide our actions. These (more or less) true hallucinations are what we (implicitly, unconsciously) use to construct the reality that we experience within the monadic space of our consciousness. We do not have a direct access to reality as it is. Nor are we able to experience the construct of somebody else\u2019s mind directly. Although this is an insight that has been around for a while (described two millennia ago by Plato\u2019s allegory of the cave) and was included into academic psychology under the term Constructivism, and comes up in every spiritual teaching that deserves this label, it remains quite counter-intuitive to the naive, unreflected mind. There is this quality of is-ness to our experience of the world. We think we know what is true since we\u2019ve seen it. It takes a good deal of personal development to transcend this positivistic level of consciousness that is ignorant to the fact that one\u2019s own experience is partial and biased by a world of previous partial experiences that act as the base-vectors with which we triangulate (interpolate) this new data-set. In other words, the experience that constitute our human lives is determined by us, the observer, the subject, more than it is by the object \u2014 and this is so in a radical sense. We become the self-fulfilling prophecy of our unreflected beliefs.This may seem like a philosophical digression, but it is actually crucial to Holochain and distributed applications because: communication forms the fabric of our society. We, as a species, are so much more capable because we coordinate. Many act as if they were one. And the basis for that is communication. Exchange of thoughts. Telepathy through small mouth-noises. Language, written words, radio, television. The internet is not just a network of computers, it is the latest and most efficient way for achieving mainstream telepathy. Without it, you could not read my thoughts as you do right now. But, the way we used it up until now is data-centric. Even blockchain is stuck in that same old paradigm. We pretend to use websites and applications as places where something is the case. We imply objectivity where actually everything we see in our Facebook stream is what Facebook\u2019s servers (and thus the company Facebook) communicates to the client software that runs on our phones. It feels like an open, public space \u2014 while it actually is Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s living room in which we meet. A room that has this strange property that every time there is an interesting conversation going on between some folks, messages from advertisers are magically modulated over the sound waves traveling through the air and holographic images appear between people. Magic that is possible only because what we mistake for an open space actually is content communicated from Facebook to us. Facebook is saying something and we are listening. And even worse, Facebook is whispering something different into each of our ears \u2014 a fact that can and is exploited with severe consequences.Mistaking one agent, one perspective, for the truth\u2122 is a common correlate of an oversimplifying data-centric architecture and something that implies or promotes centralization of power.The web, as it was introduced by Tim Berners-Lee a quarter of a century ago, was meant to be different. Sitting on top of a fully decentralized Internet, the web constituted of HTML and HTTP was implicitly agent-centric back then. The idea was that every scientist (which was the main target audience) would run their own HTTP server to distribute their written thoughts and research results to everyone who wanted to read them. Nobody else but the author has the power (read: the ability) to change/insert/censor their words. The space in which this happens is URLs/domain names or as a fallback even IP addresses. Because these addresses are what identifies a person and their machine, right? Err, well.. This assumption is actually part of the reason why this model could not reach mainstream adoption as those Web 2.0 services like Facebook (starting with MySpace and many others) did a decade later. Not everybody was a scientist and thus not everybody a) had a constant internet connection (at least not until recently) as universities did early on and b) was able to set up their own web server and code up their own app. So all these Myspaces, Facebooks, eBays and Airbnb\u2019s could deliver on a need that most of those days\u2019 Internet users had (and still have) by creating a space in which people could upload their data in order for others to be able to retrieve it \u2014 without the need to run a server farm with expensive always-on connection nor learn how to code a rich and easy-to-use UI. Of course this came with the cost of the aforementioned centralization and power imbalance. But pragmatically speaking, it is what had to happen.In an agent-centric world, agents \u2014 users, humans with their machines \u2014 constitute the basic root layer of the ontology. Data, then, is correctly represented by something an agent either perceives as input or creates (says) as output. There is no absolute, nor objective truth \u2014 as in true outside of the context of an agent claiming or believing or denying the validity of an expression. Objectivity could be approached by inter-subjectivity \u2014 when and where needed \u2014 not as a central aspect of the architecture like with blockchains. Every agent is free to act as they deem useful and is sovereign to make sense of the world (=everything everybody else is saying and doing) as it makes sense for their unique perspective and use-case. If that entails trusting other parties\u2019 output in the process it is a conscious decision and not implied by the architecture.To go from data-centrism to agent-centrism means to understand that data intrinsically always is contextual. It inverts the ontological dependency between agents and data. Instead of modelling users as a certain kind of data, all data is an output of some agent. There is no data without at least one agent that acts as the source.Truly Agent-Centric ApplicationsSo far, with our current Holochain alpha prototype, each application is its own thing and brings its own UI. Look at Clutter for instance:Standalone UI of Clutter, our distributed Twitter clone.The UI of Holochain apps is loosely coupled in that the Holochain run-time after reading the application\u2019s DNA and spawning a node just serves a directory containing a web UI. The application\u2019s DNA defines certain functions that are made accessible to the UI.In our chat, a community member recently posted a chess implementation on Holochain which of course has a completely different UI:UI of Holochess.Now this is fine and dandy and in conjunction with distributed hosting via Holo on an army of HoloPorts, we could basically rebuild every centralized Facebook or Amazon application in a distributed fashion and have the same UX as we do now. Because of the agent-centric architecture of Holochain that is working under the hood (and thus eliminating the need for either a centralized server or a huge blockchain that forces everybody to store, sync, run and validate everything) these distributed apps could actually scale to Facebook size while running a full client on a mobile device. That in itself is already a huge step forward. (Again, if this huge claim renders you doubtful please have a look at our whitepaper and benchmarks and try out Clutter now \u2014 and then give us feedback.)But what really deeply excites me is to elevate this agent-centric paradigm-shift into high-level user interface semantics. Because here\u2019s the thing:The whole point of the Internet is to have agents/humans communicate with agents/humans.See, those 2 billion Facebook users are not visiting facebook.com because they want to learn more about the company Facebook \u2014 they want to connect to their friends. Right now, you point your browser to medium.com to read this post of mine. It does look very different if you get my messages through Slack or WhatsApp, and I have to search many places for that link somebody sent me last week. Interoperability isn\u2019t always compatible with business models of the big 4. But the intention for us to use these tools is the same. The Internet\u2019s implicit central use case is telepathy \u2014 exchange of thoughts between humans. It is the technological embodiment of culture. And human culture is human-centric, not word- or book- or site- or app-centric.Besides censorship, privacy and power concerns, the problem with monolithic, data-centric and centralized applications is that they are silos. Not only data but also user interface silos. One does not simply rip out Facebook\u2019s timeline to show updates from friends merged with those coming in through Twitter, Google+, WhatsApp and email in one view. Even if you would have access to all data via APIs then you would need to write the UI from scratch and resembling the native UI would be hard work. And what if, after you did that, all your friends switch to Snapchat?The way we think about Holochain apps is that they should be microservices, small units, modules with a clear purpose, inputs and outputs. Similar to text-based Unix/Linux command line apps that are combined in shell scripts or steered from a GUI to cater for a certain use-case.With Holochain apps already being decoupled from their UI and using bridging, you could write an app that talks to all other apps running on the same device under the same agency (basically authorizing apps to access the same functions exposed to the UI) and presents you with an aggregated interface. But if every native app UI is its own standalone front-end (one built with React, the other with Angular, another one with native iOS widgets\u2026), reusing UI components is almost impossible.I would like to see the Holochain app ecosystem be smarter and make use of one quite significant fact:Since Holochain is a space of distributed, agent-centric apps, it intrinsically is a human/social network.Network topology of five agents running three different apps. Every app is it\u2019s own p2p network. The user\u2019s agent (=device + Holochain installation) is the point where apps meet. A better fitting metaphor than application might be language. You could be speaking \u201cClutter\u201d to two other agents, and simultaneously speaking \u201cHoloChat\u201d to two different agents. Maybe everybody is understanding \u201cDPKI\u201d. Either way, knowing which other agents are there and what apps they are running is an implicit basic layer of the Holochain ecosystem. It is a social network of agents \u2014 isomorphic to the underlying human network of users.Instead of reiterating the misplaced ontology of documents, websites and monolithic applications, why don\u2019t we invert that dependency and put agents/users/humans at the center of how the Holochain app ecosystem works? Not only under the hood but consistently throughout all layers, including the user interface?To be explicit, I propose to:build a general-purpose UI for Holochain apps, implying certain protocols that app developer could choose to follow. I am talking about a browser for the Holochain app ecosystem that is not opening HTML documents but instead is facilitating communication between the user and other users, groups, teams, organizations and the network as a whole. Think: decentralized WeChat. Basically a very generalized address book/team chat/social network/collaboration UI with no specialized functionality as that is to be filled-in by those many apps which are meant to work together as micro-services. It is an agent-centric UI in that it represents other agents and the relationships/teams/threads/social spaces the user is part of. And it is of course a container of Holochain instances. It displays entries of all Holochain apps using the new entry type semantics we are about to introduce with the next Holochain DNA iteration to automatically create a more fitting UI widget. Ultimately, it sports a UI component system that enables app developers and users to customize how entries are rendered. Qt\u2019s QML is a super elegant UI component language that I see as the perfect fit for this. The native version of this browser could use native Qt. For Holo\u2019s pure web based access to Holochain apps we could use this QML web port.define a human-centric/social API (the protocols/interface functions) this browser uses to query apps for entries. Besides UI, every Holochain app consists of a set of entry types it defines, their validation functions and semantics, and zome functions that are UI facing (see documentation). In order to support the browser\u2019s ontology, an app needs to provide, for instance, a way to retrieve all entries that should be displayed when a user\u2019s/agent\u2019s profile is visited or rendered: get_entries_per_agent(visited_agent). Or when displaying all entries within a social context (like a private message thread or a team collaboration space): get_entries_in_context(thread).When entries can be read from social contexts they also need to be posted:post_to_thread(entry, thread)orpost_to_agent(entry, agent).I\u2019m just naming a few examples here to communicate the idea in principle. Maybe what we need is just all CRUD operations on all levels of the social holarchy \u2014 i.e. for agents, message threads, teams, organizations, \u2026establish an inter-app URL schema to have fully qualified entry references. Within the context of a Holochain app, an entry\u2019s address is just its SHA-256 hash which is used to do a DHT lookup within the network that is this app to retrieve the content (remember, each Holochain app is its own p2p network). In order to fully address content from an inter-app context, any link needs to include the app that is the space in which this entry lives. Luckily, every Holochain app is uniquely identified by its DNA. The current alpha version is already using the DNA\u2019s SHA-256 as the unique identifier of that app when looking for and connecting to peers running the same app. Protocol Labs\u2019 IPLD is built for the very use-case of linking entries across applications/networks/blockchains. Can we have every Holochain be an IPLD protocol specifier?/<App DNA Hash>/<Entry Hash>One central aspect here is these social contexts. Following the notion of Holochain apps being micro-services, like Unix commands, that can be aggregated within the context of an agent to implement more complex tasks, there should be a Holochain app for these social contexts that is:storing a list of friends in each agent\u2019s local source chainintroducing social context entries that are publicly shared in the DHT and that link to their members (think teams)allowing for cascading/fractal social contexts, so we can have teams of teams, i.e. organizations etc.Social contexts is what the browser displays as locations. And there are implicit, transient locations like for instance all friends that are online right now:UI mock-up of Holochain browser showing virtual location of online Friends. Each agent is rendered with all entries that are visible for the user, across all apps, applying entry semantics defined in the app.This example shows entries from three different apps (Clutter, Holochess and HoloChat, and maybe even another app for the avatar: HoloVault). The red puzzle-piece shows that this is an entry of an app that is not installed locally. We are not part of that network so we can\u2019t retrieve its contents, but since the browser knows which app it is (because it was referenced via the intra-app schema) it can offer an install button, which in-turn would use the Holochain of Holochains (HCHC), the distributed \u201capp store\u201d to download and install that app. This way of discovering new apps through the interaction with other users already using the app is an aspect that seems trivial but my feeling is that it would make a tremendous difference for the adaptability of this ecosystem. Especially since apps, in this alternative universe, are really a superposition of full-fledged application and plug-in.Take my favorite example: a dislike button. If I want to dislike Philip\u2019s Clutter post up there, I could just write my own new Holochain app that is basically just storing dislikes, with every dislike consisting of just one inter-app link. I could now dislike any entry of any Holochain app (or even any IPFS object, git commit, etc\u2026). Now, with either a custom (QML) UI component or (even better) a few more traits in our social API, the browser could show those dislikes on every entry that has one. If we choose the latter implementation, adding functions to the inter-app API that know about inter-app links, those dislikes could now be shown to everybody as an entry from an uninstalled app, just as the HoloChat example above. Which means this functionality can spread through the ecosystem easily if users choose to install the app. And that would work without having to change the code of Clutter itself, and without having to get the whole community to fork into a different \u201cconsensus\u201d. New ideas could easily be tried and if they prove useful they could be adapted by the ecosystem in large. Just as sub-cultures invent their own jargon which then sometimes becomes mainstream.Now, if we zoom out of this online list, we would see several different social contexts that the user is part of:UI mock-up of Holochain browser showing several social contexts, the fundamental fractal type of its agent-centric, social ontology.For each of these, the browser receives lists of entries from all installed apps which are being rendered inside those areas respectively. Depending on the apps installed and used by the members of a context (and maybe the access rules of that group), a social context is like the power set of a chat room, a mailing list, a YouTube channel, a shared Google Drive directory, a ticket system, a git repository, a video chat or any real-time collaboration tool, and many more.The point here is that being able to add any new functionality with just a click but maintaining the social structure in which the need for this new functionality arose makes a lot of sense for the user experience. This is how we think right now anyway when we cross app boundaries and build the stack we need to collaborate.Social context, now as a general term, is the main thing we as social beings rely on to make sense of what is going on. It is what is always there for us to contextualize information, experiences and decisions \u2014 mostly implicitly. I believe it is crucial to build communication tools that make social contexts explicit.And remember, since every Holochain app is its own sub-network, it is totally possible to spawn a cloned app instance (of say HoloChat) for each team, also with just the press of a button. It would create a fully distributed, encrypted by default, and, as described above, customizable virtual space that emerges just between the machines of the members of this team, no central servers, no miners, no peers that can\u2019t cross the app\u2019s membrane.Convinced?Let\u2019s co-create!What I\u2019m proposing here is actually reaching out of the scope of Holochain core itself. Though, it is true that these ideas could inform certain implementation details as we go through the next iterations of Holochain. But in order to create a thriving and synergistic ecosystem, it needs many agents working in coherence.And the seeds for this are already planted.Our anders.aamodt expressed very similar concepts for interoperability in his Wrex paper some weeks ago, which our Philip Beadle started prototyping on the current Holochain alpha version already, laying out an idea about Social DNA, a inter-app identity management called HoloVault, and details about one very central Holochain core app: DPKI (distributed public key infrastructure).What I am describing here is touching and integrating the work of my dear friends and colleagues at Noomap in many ways. This Holochain browser feels like a light version of H4OME \u2014 the brainchild and big vision of Chris Larcombe and myself \u2014 but infused with the agent-centric paradigm-shift. I had many co-creative sessions with Andrea Harding about social architecture and social holarchies that prepared several of these ideas. Tan, I\u2019m sure Synergy Space would benefit so much from this architecture. And I\u2019d definitely love to see Chris coming up with a fractal, Noomap-like UI for this Holochain browser!I am engaged in ongoing conversations with Harlan T Wood on this matter. We actually came up with a name for this browser: HoloScope! My feeling is that Harlan\u2019s Trust Graph is also a very interesting candidate for one of the Holochain core apps. It could be used by HoloScope to represent these social contexts.I know that Adam Apollo is also deeply involved in next-gen, decentralized Internet projects with extraterrestrial UI and surely would have some interesting thoughts on this. :)Sebastian Deutsch, my former boss at 9elements, gave me very helpful feedback on Holochain core already that is finding its way into the next iteration. Your thoughts on this?I also want to reach out to Malek Jaber! Malek, long-time no see but I remember very well how our first half-night long conversation evolved around socially inspired, global software architecture. :) I think we need to talk again!An interesting project that has many similarities to the Holochain approach and especially the social piece I am talking about here is Secure Scuttlebutt. I would love to get into touch with Dominic Tarr or mix irving and start thinking about an implementation of SSB on Holochain using the node-to-node communication capability as some middle-way between private source chains and public DHTs.Since I\u2019m suggesting to build a new kind of browser, maybe Desigan Chinniah or his colleagues at Mozilla are interested in a collaboration?My gut feeling is that this thing wants to be co-created among several experienced architects, developers and designers. With this post I\u2019m inviting discourse and participation across organizational boundaries, not only from those mentioned above but everybody who has feedback to share!Next steps: hearing and incorporating your feedback and creating a more formally detailed spec.", "responses": 23, "tags": ["Holochain", "Distributed Systems", "Web3", "Agent Centric", "Social Network"]}, {"title": "A Tour of Holo\u2019s Initial Apps", "post_link": "https://medium.com/h-o-l-o/a-tour-of-holos-initial-apps-45b00f7e9054?source=search_post", "author_name": "Arthur Brock", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@artbrock", "publish_date": "2019-04-15", "last_modified_date": "2019-04-16", "readtime": "6.64", "claps": 3564, "voters": 186, "content": "A Tour of Holo\u2019s Initial AppsArthur BrockFollowApr 15 \u00b7 7 min readWith the release of Holo\u2019s Closed Alpha test network, I thought this would be a good time to share about the apps available for hosting on Holo. While there\u2019s not a huge ecosystem yet, the apps we\u2019re releasing are kind of a big deal, both for their individual capabilities and for their usefulness as building blocks for further app development.Let\u2019s have a look at the apps and why they matter.DeepKey \u2014 Key ManagementSomething that continues to amaze me about the crypto space is how major hacking and thieving events are considered par for the course. How many times do we need to hear about this or that multi-signature bug, or so-and-so\u2019s death, that resulted in millions of dollars lost? There\u2019s been a remarkably high level of tolerance for these situations, but the way I see it, crypto cannot go mainstream with that kind of risk profile. A solid key management foundation has to be a core building block of a robust Web 3.0.Holochain\u2019s implementation of a Distributed Public Key Infrastructure and key management protocol, DeepKey, addresses this issue directly. Thanks to Holochain\u2019s agent-centric architecture, DeepKey is able to associate keys not with actual data, but with authorship and control of data. The legitimate author can replace or revoke keys in use at any time, by employing a master seed and/or revocation key that are never stored within applications.DeepKey is the one application that we are expecting everyone who runs Holochain apps to have. Technically someone could use another key manager that replicates the features of DeepKey, but DeepKey is the one that ships natively with Holo.I\u2019m excited about DeepKey. I don\u2019t know of any other crypto apps that assume this kind of approach to key management. And I believe something like it is necessary if we are going to make crypto safe for normal people to use.Personas \u2014 Personal data managementWhile keys control access to data, they don\u2019t serve any function with regard to identity verification; they don\u2019t demonstrate who you actually are. That\u2019s where Personas comes in.Personas provides a convenient way to own and manage your personal identity. You can change your information all in one place, and you can revoke applications\u2019 access to it as desired. It\u2019s a lot like how you can log in to a bunch of websites and apps these days using Google or Facebook\u2026 with the difference being that Personas is \u2018self-sovereign\u2019, meaning you have full control and ownership.What\u2019s more, you can create multiple identities within Personas \u2014 say, if you have one name that you use in the business world, and another when you DJ or publish poetry. Maybe you\u2019re James over here and Jim over there, or maybe you use a married name in some contexts and an original name in others. You choose which identity to use in any given application, and access to those identities can be easily revoked or swapped.Incidentally, this revocability of data access also makes it easy for apps to be GDPR compliant.Note that Personas is not designed to verify that you are who you say you are; its purpose is for you to say who you are, store that information, and easily share it with apps and the other people using them. We are addressing verification separately with a KYC application and ecosystem targeted for release in the next round.Holo Hosting App \u2014 Bridging web users to crypto apps on HolochainFor all of the buzz about soon-to-exist decentralized social networks, scalable payment systems, and advertising engines, such a reality simply isn\u2019t possible with blockchain, at least not any time soon. The dApps that currently exist are limited in scope and ability, and, because of the overhead of gas payments, are often constrained to high-revenue addictions like gambling.By contrast, most activities people currently do on the web are possible to build on Holochain. It\u2019s fast enough and scalable enough to run the likes of Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Wikipedia, Reddit, and so on. In order for these kinds of apps to be valuable, though, they need to be accessible to everyone, not just users running Holochain software. That\u2019s where Holo\u2019s hosting system comes in.It\u2019s probably worth taking a moment to distinguish clearly between Holo and Holochain, since this is often a source of confusion.Holochain is a data-integrity engine for powering distributed apps without encountering the scalability bottlenecks common to blockchains. It has no built-in currency.Holo is a hosting company that provides hosting infrastructure for Holochain apps to be served to regular web browsers. Holo works by tapping into computing power wherever it already is, providing an alternative to centralized hosting services like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft\u2019s Azure. This is analogous to how AirBnB sells more room-nights than the largest hotel chains without ever having built a hotel. Holo does have a native currency, HoloFuel, to account for all the micro-transactions involved in hosting.Okay, now we get back to the Holo Hosting App, which is the app that allows anyone to provide virtual Holochain space (and generate revenue in doing so) to those who have not installed Holochain. The app match-makes between host and user in real time, taking into consideration the performance metrics of the host and the requirements of the app, as well as constraints and preferences that are settable by the host and app publisher.The Holo Hosting App bridges from the Web 2.0 world to the Web 3.0 world by making crypto apps available in standard browsers to users with no knowledge of crypto, keys, or gas. In this way, massively scaled crypto applications become not only possible, but user-friendly as well.HoloFuel \u2014 P2P crypto-accounting-based currency that does not require global consensusHoloFuel is the payment system that powers the Holo hosting framework. It is optimized for high-volumes of micro-transactions, in order to account for the billions of small actions that hosting involves. It is not a token-based cryptocurrency, but rather is account-based, meaning that it uses crypto-accounting to track balances without use of a token.Unlike with token-based currencies, there is no limit to the number of transactions per second (TPS) that can take place within the HoloFuel framework, because it doesn\u2019t require global consensus to ensure the integrity of its transactions. That may seem like a bold statement, but it\u2019s one of the fundamental principles of Holo and Holochain: instead of requiring global consensus on what was \u2018said\u2019, HoloFuel builds in ways to ensure integrity in everyone\u2019s \u2018speaking\u2019, as validated by a small number of randomly selected nodes (25 to be exact in HoloFuel\u2019s initial configuration).As a result, asking how many transactions HoloFuel can process per second is like asking how many web pages the internet can serve: the answer increases with the number of hosts on the network, not limited by any inherent speed bottleneck.By comparison, Bitcoin currently uses 1/200th of the world\u2019s electricity to process a meager 5 TPS. While some next-gen blockchains claim TPS improvements, most achieve this mainly through increased centralization. HoloFuel remains fully distributed and efficient at any scale, without the rich-get-richer centralization pressure common in other cryptocurrencies, and with no computing power wasted on proof-of-work or proof-of-stake algorithms.Also, because HoloFuel is technically an implementation of accounting, as opposed to a token-based system which creates and implements new securities, it may be less exposed to regulatory risk.HoloChat \u2014 A chat back-end to power multiple User InterfacesHoloChat is a chat engine that can easily power a variety of chat and commenting user interfaces. Some examples of what\u2019s possible include:Instant messaging, like TelegramMulti-channel team chat, like SlackA chat/forum site, like RedditA website commenting tool, like DisqusLive customer support chatOne neat effect of having a common chat back-end across all these UIs is that you might log in to Holochat directly and view all of your comments across different websites \u2014 comments which, by the way, you own and control.HoloChat is the one consumer app that launches with this initial round, but it\u2019s flexible enough to be considered many apps in one.hApp Store \u2014 App directoryThe hApp Store is a distributed app for distributing distributed apps. I believe it\u2019s the first distributed app store; all others I\u2019m aware of are centralized. As of now the hApp store contains a directory with names and descriptions, and it will soon include ratings, reviews, and various types of tagging.With the hApp Store, we can even make the distribution of our own software decentralized, which I think is pretty cool.Apps coming in the next release for Open AlphaFinally, here\u2019s a preview of apps coming in the near future:Source chain backups (including private entries)Built-in file sharingKYC ecosystem for HoloFuel, hosts, app providers, & devsA Holochain of Holochains (HCHC) for publishing apps, receiving technical feedback on them, and making them visible in the hApp store.All of these apps can be building blocks for other appsEach of these apps have powerful individual functions that address problems similar to what other projects have raised tens or hundreds of millions of dollars to solve. Yet since Holochain enables easy bridging between applications you can use them like LEGO blocks for your own app, or blend many micro-apps into a single user interface. This means dev teams don\u2019t need to build huge, monolithic, apps that try to do everything.It\u2019s really a dynamic sandbox we\u2019re creating. At our hackathons it\u2019s been amazing to see the collaborative space that opens up once developers understand the modular and bridgeable nature of Holochain app development.I very much look forward to seeing what people create with these initial apps.Learn more and follow us at Holo\u2019s website or publication, or Holochain\u2019s website or publication.

From 23\u201325 May, thanks to everyone at Epic Labs who put the event together, there are three days of innovative talks, coding and hanging out ahead of us. If you still don\u2019t have tickets, get them now; the event will take place at Epic Lab\u2019s HQ, on Calle Salvatierra, 4 (4th floor).Our whole team will be thereDatafund hosted the last event and this year its whole team is heading off to Spain to see what the Swarm community has been up to in the past year.As current Fair Data Society\u2019s core code contributors Datafund\u2019s team will be presenting what they have been working on in recent months. Three speakers have prepared talks for the event: Datafund\u2019s CTO, Tadej Fius, and the two senior coders, Dan Nickless & Zahoor Mohamed. The focus of their talks will be largely on how to scale and expand decentralized file exchange through Swarm.Multibox, setting up Fairdrop & sending 100 GBs over SwarmFirst up will be Tadej with his presentation of multibox, the decentralized group file-sharing functionality based on Fairdrop\u2019s file exchange system. Dan will demonstrate to the audience how to set up their own file-sharing dapp with the help of the fds.js library. And finally, Zahoor will present how he went about sending 100 GB files over the Swarm network with the accompanying pitfalls and solutions. There will also be five-minute Q&A sessions after each talk and we expect some lively debates.We\u2019ll be following the event and will post all the highlights and summaries of talks, as well as uploading all the videos relating to the talks on Fair Data Society\u2019s tech to our Youtube channel after the summit, so keep following us to stay up to date.\u2764 The beautiful city of Madrid \u2764See you there!We\u2019re looking forward to meeting everyone from the community again, talking about the new tech on Swarm and hanging out in a good-spirited atmosphere.If you\u2019re interested in what the infrastructure of the new web will look like, come and join us.When: 23\u201325 MayWhere: Epic Lab\u2019s HQ, on Calle Salvatierra, 4 (4th floor), 28034, MadridTickets: hereMore info: hereSee you there!", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Latest", "Tech", "Blockchain", "Swarm Orange Summit 2019", "Web3"]}, {"title": "The Challenge of UX in Ethereum", "post_link": "https://medium.com/ecf-review/challenge-of-ux-in-ethereum-122e1a33688d?source=search_post", "author_name": "Anna Rose", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@AnnaRRose", "publish_date": "2018-06-25", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-27", "readtime": "8.6", "claps": 1545, "voters": 151, "content": "The Challenge of UX in EthereumAnna RoseFollowJun 25, 2018 \u00b7 9 min readThis text was produced by Zero Knowledge, a podcast hosted by Anna Rose and Fredrik Harryson, which explores the decentralised technology that will power the emerging Web3 and the community building it. The podcast is made for developers and technically-minded people looking to educate themselves on the inner workings of the space.\u201cEverybody in this space talks about how the Blockchain is \u201ctrustless\u201d and \u201ctransparent\u201d. It is (almost) certainly true at a programmatic level, software verifying data, but those two assumptions fall apart when you confront them with the actual end user experience.\u201d \u2014 Beltran Berrocal in \u2018Web3 Design Principles\u2019 [1]The day after EDCON 2018 wrapped in Toronto, a small gathering of some of the major wallet creators and dApp developers met for the Web3 UX Unconference. The purpose of the event was to get these builders on the same page, helping the entire group understand how many of them faced the same challenges and were trying to solve for the same problems. It was here that we had a chance to do a series of interviews with the participants about the topic of UX in the blockchain space \u2014 including some challenges they are all experiencing. Our interviewees were Alex van de Sande (Ethereum Foundation), Jonny Howle (uPort), Dan Finlay (Metamask), Richard Burton (balance.io), Philippe Castonguay, Bryant Eisenbach, & Dan Tsui \u2014 the recording of the podcast can be found HERE.Below is a summary of some these pain points, as well as some additional ideas we have started to think about since the event. We hope this article can lay out some of the problem space in Web3 UX design, and invite developers, designers, builders to work on these pain points and challenges.Pain point #1: Getting started in EthereumStrangers in a strange landGiven that the space is still very much at the stage where it is built \u201cby developers for developers\u201d, non-technical users may find the first few steps into the Ethereum ecosystem very disorienting. Some of the language and concepts will be foreign, and this holds even for those more experienced developers. There is an onboarding and self-education period that many people (including those who have been working in technological fields for many years) must go through in order to be able to understand and navigate this space. And while there are resources available, there still remains a lack of clear documentation, curriculum, or courseware.Built for flippingIn order to engage with the Ethereum blockchain, a user will need ether. And to get ether, most users will need to first buy it. Therefore, the journey for most users really starts at exchanges. Protocol-level and dApp developers need to bear this in mind at every step of the construction of their project.As Alex van de Sande of the Ethereum Foundation pointed out in his interview, an exchange or trading platform as an entry point will inevitably attract certain people, and will also turn off others. He suggested this may be the reason that the majority of the users entering the space are people who are looking to \u201cflip crypto\u201d. This may also help to explain why so much of the culture (games, language, and focus) is around flipping tokens, non-fungible tokens, or things like CryptoKitties. Flipping can be tons of fun, but this is not a universally loved game, and it will definitely attract certain kinds of users over others.This represents a barrier to entry at the beginning of the funnel \u2014 some designers of DApps, catering to less experienced users, will need to take this into account and develop ways to make this initial step into the ecosystem easier.Pain point #2: GasRepeatedly, the very concept of Gas was questioned by this group. Gas must be calculated and charged for every transaction, adding complexity to the user experience and an obstacle for new users to engage. This is a no-brainer for people already well within the space \u2014 we know it serves an important role in the entire protocol design \u2014 however, for individuals first arriving here, the very idea of Gas is strange. We all have a certain level of familiarity with seemingly \u2018free\u2019 electronic payments when we use things like credit cards, or Venmo. However, putting transaction data on a blockchain incurs real costs \u2014 and although it for now it may be only a few cents, it can still be a deterrent because of the cognitive friction involved. We need to stress this importance, and to think of further alternatives toward reducing, hiding, or removing gas fees altogether for more user-friendly experiences.Pain point #3: Private Key Management & RecoveryIn all the interviews, private key management was definitely the pain point raised most often. Private key management (or rather mis-management) has left many people vulnerable to theft and loss of access.Jonny Howle from uPort clearly articulated this issue in our interview: the idea of relying on seed phrases and pieces of paper is untenable. So while there is some value in the practice of managing funds this way, truly independent of any third party providers, the risks associated with key management of this nature will likely be too large for the majority of the population to be expected to take on.And what about the lost private keys? Many of us have experienced the frustration of losing a password or private key to an account. There have been many stories of people with old wallets containing thousands of tokens (worth millions in Fiat money) now inaccessible to them due to the mismanagement of their private key.In response, according to Dan Finlay of Metamask, many teams are developing ways to push users to use their keys in smarter ways, or have the keys live in more secure locations along the user flow. Applications like MyCrypto are moving away from dealing with private keys altogether and are outsourcing it to hardware wallets and mobile signer applications. Geth is extracting their key management from the node to an application of its own. Encouraging users to move away from having keys in the browser is a good thing, but it\u2019s unclear what an accepted \u201cbest practice\u201d would actually be, especially if you can\u2019t or don\u2019t want to buy a hardware wallet.Pain point #4: Standardisation of UXOne of the benefits of bringing these wallet creators together for the conference was the clear realization that many teams are grappling with the same problems. However, a common design language and standardised Best Practices still remain elusive across the ecosystem. Many teams have been trying to solve these UX challenges mostly independently of one another. Incentivized UX surveys, openness to feedback, and daily community interaction is core to ramp up the speed of this UX work and develop consistency.Pain point #5: Blockchain VocabularyCertain names have been adopted for blockchain related elements \u2014 such as wallets or coins \u2014 which actually are not really representative of what these things actually are. MyCrypto\u2019s Taylor Monahan also pointed this out in this talk from earlier this year. According to Monahan, \u201cThe term \u2018wallet\u2019 is confusing, and people bring a lot of assumptions about this word depending on their experiences inside and outside the crypto-space\u201d [2]. The trouble with applying language from the outside world, in ways that don\u2019t apply 1:1, is that users will inevitably have incorrect expectations, could interact improperly with these things, and could accidentally make mistakes.For example, ERC20 tokens are often confused with \u201creal\u201d tokens. And yet, precedents in our community\u2019s codebase & standards state that the only first-class token is Ether, while everything else is a smart contract. In fact, there are things you can do with Ether that you can\u2019t with ERC20s. However, given that the term \u201ctoken\u201d is being used, this is something that is often poorly understood by users when it comes to ERC20 tokens.Given how early the space truly is, it\u2019s almost as if a significant part of the language hasn\u2019t yet been invented, and that the very underlying ideas could use some rethinking. The bottom line here is that we will need to empower more experienced communicators and UX folks, and give them a platform for reshaping the space.Pain point #6: Communicating ClearlyThe feeling is that when it comes to dApp experiences, users aren\u2019t sufficiently being told what is going on or what is clearly happening. Even more experienced blockchain \u201cusers\u201d, in reality, have only become used to this kind of experience, via habit, and could not really claim to be completely aware and not left in the dark.For example, take signing a transaction: the software is creating the transaction, and the user is just signing it with their key. No one is actually \u201chand-making\u201d their transactions. So if you can\u2019t verify or see what the software has made in some way, the only recourse is to trust the software and sign whatever it gives you.The UX problem here is that is there is no way to verify that what you are signing is what it\u2019s supposed to be. This is unlike a similar \u201cweb world\u201d counterpart, where you can click the green lock in the browser, and inspect the SSL certificate to see if a site is actually legit or a scam. This is a point the community is acutely aware of, and EIPs have been proposed to remedy (eg. EIP 712)Pain point #7: The Lack of UX DesignersSo far, the largest groups to get involved in this space are devs, researchers, and traders. UX and design have been a bit of an afterthought. In a way, the incentives aren\u2019t exactly there to get UX designers engaged and ready to jump in. UX work isn\u2019t always as visible on GitHub, and often has a very different rhythm and different requirements than \u201cstraight\u201d development. According to the Open Source Design blog, \u201cGitHub \u2026 caters exclusively to developers\u2019 unique needs and abilities. In doing so, it excludes other stakeholders and becomes a developer silo. Design is not like this. It cannot exist in isolation. Design is about understanding, facilitation and collaboration\u201d [3] While many teams have committed their efforts to include more designers from the entire UX spectrum in their projects, more emphasis and better incentivisation for design work will be the key to galvanize both design and development to work towards a better user experience.ConclusionSome of the bad UX in Blockchain is actually seen as a bit of a badge of honor \u2014 the thinking goes \u201conly technically savvy folks will actually be able to use this, and the others will be filtered out by the bad UX \u201d. For some of the tech, this is excusable \u2014 especially the protocol level stuff. But lack of good design can also cause major damage to the trust afforded the system \u2014 with users sending funds to the wrong addresses or making other avoidable mistakes. So if this is a technology that we eventually want the larger society to engage with, we need to change this attitude about UX.While there are some builders experimenting with solutions to these problems, there hasn\u2019t emerged any clear best practices for how to address these UX challenges yet. And so the door is open for UX designers and thinkers to weigh in on ways the users of decentralised technologies can be better onboarded. An example is this thread for all those who are coming together to work on basic principles and components for good UX across the ecosystem.The community needs your feedback and ideas as we rely on this to find solutions for some of the issues we listed, and many more that might not come to our attention. Please reach out, your suggestions are welcomed, encouraged, and necessary. These unique challenges in the Web3 UX design space that present some interesting opportunities for the community to work on \u2014 and if you have the energy and dedication, the ECF welcomes you to apply here for a grant to help lead the way towards better solutions.This text was produced by Zero Knowledge Podcast and is based on a series of interviews done at the Web3 UX Unconference in Toronto in early May 2018.

To hold this information on paper you would roughly need the entire world to be covered with trees to be converted into books. In 2015 this figure was 7900 Exabytes. In 2020 this number will be 40900. This exponentially growing information will be consumed by Internet users whose numbers are also growing rapidly.by Hanny NaibahoIn Indonesia alone, the 105M Internet users are expected to grow to 125M in the next 4 years. That is 20 million more people coming online in the next 4 years. That is in a single country alone.To make matters more complicated, the difference between yearly price drop in storage (40%) and bandwidth (26%) is almost double.All this means that we will have more people, streaming more data on channels that are not scaling as fast. This creates congestion that at one point in time cannot be solved by just adding more hardware.Congestion being just one problem, today the Internet is a centralized system that naturally has a single point of failure. This point of failure can be misused to disable access to the Internet for an entire country. This is exactly what happened to Egypt in 2011 during the January revolution. When the president didn\u2019t want to be overthrown he decided to pull the plug on what was feeding the protests, the Internet. As we know, in the end it didn\u2019t help but the effect was clear, four major ISP providers cut the wire and the country was cut off from the world. Single point of failure here was the fact that all communication between the protestors was going in and out of Egypt instead of directly between the people and when that door was shut, nothing worked anymore.Clearly, the problem exists, now let\u2019s look at how businesses can benefit from this by investing in the technologies that offer solutions. This is where IPFS and Blockchain come in.IPFSIPFS or Interplanetary File System is a new Internet protocol initially designed by Juan Benet in 2014 with the goal of storing data permanently, remove duplications across the network, and obtain addresses to information stored on network computers. It is now an open-source project. Unlike HTTP, it is resource, not location oriented. Instead of communicating by pointing to locations, IPFS points to the resource itself. It then gets this resource from whoever has the data or parts of it stored creating a decentralized network.Photo by NASA on UnsplashSo why should you care about whether the Internet protocol you are using is location-based or not? For this lets compare these two approaches.HTTP works by mapping the resources with location-based IP addresses. It uses them to point to computers in a specific location that have the resource a client needs.If you want to stream a 4k video on Youtube, for example, your browser needs to look up that video on a server in the Google data center far away and have that stream propagate all the way to you. In reality, there is something called content delivery network (CDN) that \u201cbrings\u201d the servers closer to you but it may still be hundreds of kilometers away and has little help in the developing countries.Imagine you are in a lecture together with 100 people and you all watch the same video. What happens is that this video has to be fetched from the closest nodes of Google, streamed to each of the student\u2019s laptops and repeated 100 times. Instead of students, who have an identical copy of the video, sharing it with each other, we propagate large amounts of data, long distances, multiple times. Inefficient, but this is how HTTP works and it is creating large congestion problems on the backbone of the Internet.IPFS helps to resolve congestion and overly controlling governments by distributionInstead of locations, IPFS addresses point directly to the resources and it makes sure that this data comes from the closest sources. This means that if a classroom full of students would watch the same video, they would fetch it from each other instead of any central location. This would make streaming a 4k video bufferless.You may now ask how does this differ from the well-known Bitorrent protocol and how will it change the Web?While it borrows heavily from the tried and tested technologies like Git and BitTorrent, it offers a completely separate solution. How BitTorrent works is that for every torrent you have a separate swarm, or group or users, who share a single file, or torrent. If there are two videos with different language packs, there would be 2 swarms and they would not be able to cross-share anything. Not even the parts of the file that are identical, which in this case is 99% of the file.With IPFS the entire World Wide Web can be considered as one torrent file that everyone sharesAlso, BitTorrent doesn\u2019t support all data types, which makes life harder. Neither does it care at all about deduplication which means that two identical videos can co-exist and be shared on the network adding to the data congestion problems.With IPFS the entire World Wide Web can be considered as one torrent file that everyone shares. Any document, video, audio file or an entire application, or just parts of them sit on the local storage of an Internet users computer and it is shared between everyone on the network. The protocol takes care of finding the closest peers who have what you need.The network automatically deletes duplicates and tracks version history. It achieves this by giving each file submitted to IPFS a unique cryptographic hash that depends on the content. Historic versioning prevents information from being easily erased. Combined with Blockchain and these unique addresses can now be saved to an immutable chain creating interesting product opportunities. IPFS is not blockchain but it is designed to work together with it. Lets look at some of the other misconceptions people have of IPFS and then come back to what applications have been built and can be built using this combination.Read also: How to solve the digital identity and bring privacy to a whole new level?MisconceptionsData stored on IPFS is persistentPermanence and persistence mean different things. Let\u2019s be clear here, IPFS doesn\u2019t guarantee persistence, the nodes on the networks decide if they think keeping something on IPFS is worth the energy or not. What you can do with IPFS though, is it that you can create the content, add it to the network and disappear without keeping any infrastructure running. Using cryptography, IPFS will serve your content as long as the network decides that it is worth doing so. The links to unique content will always remain the same but whether the network stores it is up to the users. IPFS uses crypto currencies to incentive data storage, more on that later.IPFS is built on BlockchainAlthough it uses similar architectural elements like Merkle Trees, IPFS is not built on Blockchain but rather is designed to work together with existing Blockchain protocolts. As mentioned in the misconceptions above, each file uploaded to IPFS will get a permanent address. Blockchain, unlike IPFS, is not fit to store large amounts of data. Put these together and you can store large amounts of information on IPFS and place the immutable, permanent IPFS addresses into a blockchain transaction. IPFS will provide a publicly accessible database while Blockchain makes it publicly verifiable.IPFS vs Decentralized vs DistributedIFPS is a distributed file system that allows for fast performance and decentralized data archiving.Centralized, Decentralized, Distributed -> sourceDistributed means that all data processing/archiving is not done in the same place. Those distributed services can still be under the control of a single entity.Decentralized means that no one entity has control over all the transactions.IPFS then is distributed as data is stored across the network. Decentralization, or ownership, depends on the data and the applications that manage this data.Read also: How Estonia could bring an end to Bitcoin and EthereumApplications with IPFS and BlockchainIPFS is used to store data that is publicly accessible and Blockchain is used to verify the addresses. This means 2 things. 1) You can be sure that the link referencing a specific file is really is the one you should use and 2) the link will always return the same object. This empowers the creation of platforms that help to solve the many problems today\u2019s Internet has either created or not been able to solve.by themerkle.comIntellectual PropertyOnline IP problems range from arts and music to source code and programs. Platforms like Embermine use IPFS and Blockchain to empower content creators by providing a complete ecosystem for their work. This includes revenue channels that are driven by smart contracts (applications running on Blockchain), a reputation-based collaboration network, identity protection and more.Social NetworksNetworks like Akasha and Steemit that are built on top of Blockchain and IPFS offer a truly decentralized social networking experience. They incentivize content creation by rewarding cryptocurrencies and deny control and censorship power to any data governing central actor by having its data distributed over IPFS.\u201cIn today\u2019s blockchain realm, AKASHA is a social and technological experiment enabling our collective memory, feelings, and ideas to echo freely throughout humanity\u2019s existence. By fusing Ethereum with the Inter-Planetary File System, we explore the implications and applications of a permanent Web in the context of freedom of expression, creative perpetuity, and privacy for a better home of Mind.\u201d \u2014 Akasha.worldFree E-commerceOpenBazaar creates a marketplace that, since is not centrally controlled, does not put any fees on merchants. Unlike conventional e-commerce sites like eBay or Amazon, OpenBazaar has no fees for listing or selling items. Because the trade is peer-to-peer and happening directly between buyers and sellers there is no middleman to take a cut from each sale. This is online commerce that is free for the merchant.Crypto currenciesFileCoin incentivizes data storage. You get paid in FileCoin to store data and help the IPFS network to function. Their premise is that since the massive amount of storage sits unused in data centers and hard drives around the world, one could put their unused data storage to work and earn FileCoin that could then be exchanged to other crypto or Fiat currencies.zCash promises to protect the privacy of transactions. Its payments are published on a public Blockchain, but the sender, recipient, and amount of a transaction remain private.As you can see, all of these applications work and feel like a normal HTTP browsing experience. That\u2019s what makes this a very interesting tech to play around with. It works together with HTTP and offers competent tools to solve relevant problems that the conventional systems are incapable of.All this gives platforms that leverage IPFS and Blockchain power to compete with the Internet giants of today.See also: Join the discussion in Innovation Leaders group on FacebookToday vs TomorrowThe applications of today run on web 2.0 and they do a decent job to mitigate the problems we mentioned earlier by investing a lot of money into infrastructure. The decentralized technologies that make up the web 3.0 like IPFS and Etherum Protocol need to compete with them in order to achieve any large scale adoption.They need to perform at the same level, or at least show its possible, while at the same time complement itself with much more.Here are the benefits that the web 2.0 cannot compete withTrustless multi party computations which today\u2019s technologies cannot offer means that you can perform computations on computers you don\u2019t trust. The same applies to data storage.Trusted ledgers, timestamping and verifiable applications means that operations that are happening can be mathematically proven with certainty.Applications are decentralized which means that a company who published an application on the web can disappear and the application will continue to exist without the companies infrastructure or support.End-to-end encryption is built in. Current providers cannot offer this cause they live off user data and advertisement while the web 3.0 comes with this by default.There are many more players in the world of web3.0 and they all offer us a foundation, a leverage that allows application and business developers to compete with the giants of today. Whether or not IPFS will be the technology that achieves mass adoption, it shows us what is possible.Finally if you want to play and hack around with IPFS follow these links:Hosting a website on IPFS, Technical introdution, GitHub community, How to contribute.Looking to transform your digital strategy?

This article is part of a series called \u201cThe Rebuild\u201d.Two decades have passed since the invention of the internet. It\u2019s early beginnings were full of positivity and hope for a utopian world created through free access to information. We shifted society from the TV living room to a personal computer. We went from curated mass media to person to person media. We democratized the right to create value and distribute that value to anyone in the world, at any moment. We heralded the coming information revolution as a gift to civilization.\u201cWe are all now connected by the Internet, like neurons in a giant brain. \u201c\u2014 Stephen Hawking\u201cThe Net interprets censorship as damage and routes around it.\u201d \u2014 John Gilmore 94'\u201cWe will create a civilization of the Mind in Cyberspace. May it be more humane and fair than the world your governments have made before.\u201d \u2014 John Perry Barlow 96'\u201cThe Internet isn\u2019t free. It just has an economy that makes no sense to capitalism.\u201d \u2014 Brad ShapscotHowever, for some time now, deep worrisome cracks in the internet have been widening. A cartel of internet giants have been hoarding our collective attention and power structures have leaned in to channel that attention in a game of misdirection. These giants, not inherently evil by design have evolved destructive characteristics because they sit atop an internet that is broken. If we don\u2019t do something within our lifetime, we\u2019re likely to reach a point of no return in the loss of individual freedom.The internet\u2019s corporate owners want it to become a technique of marginalisation and control. \u2014 Noam ChomskyMonopolization of the InternetMarket forces are at the heart of this problem. A few early-internet pioneers were able to exploit the immaturity of the internet to their own ends before we were able to adapt as a society. It started with the reality that:Applications are run by businessesWe interface with the internet through applications run by businesses. Their corporate structures still live in the tangible world of market forces, quarterly returns, and demanding shareholders. The result is entities that must find ways to establish themselves, create competitive moats, produce revenue and grow(endlessly). Since the internet requires a new set of domain expertise, it has allowed for a few to accelerate the formation of monopolies fuelled largely by investors playing a money making game on behalf of their limited partners. These businesses have operated in most cases for more than a half decade at revenue losses in a battle of attrition against their competition. They have produced unshakable network effect based monopolies around the services we rely on every day.Monopoly formation benefits a small few who have access at the expense of the rest of society.This trend toward monopolization is one we should all be worried about. While subsidized service offerings are compelling, the long-term sustainability of these monopolies require profit. The need for that profit to continually grow leads inevitably to necessary rent-seeking behavior on behalf of the monopoly. In many of these cases the end user is forced to bear the burden of increased costs to fuel this insatiable machine.Free forever is an exploitative, dangerous business modelOften labeled the advertisement and engagement based model, it is used by web giants like Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Google. The model incentivizes product managers and engineers to optimize their offerings to maximize a users time spent in the application to collect increasingly preposterous amounts of data to boost advertising relevance and targeting. These optimizations result in compelling applications that prey on our lesser instincts, force us into unhealthy relationships with our phones and are effective at placing us in the passenger seat of our own lives. It\u2019s a race to the bottom of the brain as more and more \u201cinnovative\u201d apps compete for our time and attention borrowing fringe concepts from the sciences to get an edge over their competition. They weaponize our cognitive biases by forcing us into micro tradeoffs between convenience and control.Monopolies are in an arms race to hoard your dataThe free forever model gets better as it learns more about you. In a race to make you more engaged and to earn the respect and dollars of advertisers, internet monopolies are heavily invested in collecting, buying, and forming their own inferences about who you are, what you want, where you\u2019ll be, and what you believe.Inference data use your engagement with the platform to determine identifiable characteristics about you based on macro-level trends and probability thresholds among other Facebook users.Prevailing characteristics of these online businesses include:focus on consolidating monopolies through network effectsoperate at a loss to destroy the competitive landscapeif possible be free forever, monetize through adsdesign your experiences to addict users, maximize time spent in the application.hoard data to graph a user\u2019s desires, fears anxieties and intentsThe Polarization of Individual BeliefThis race for our attention has led to the creation of social media and news algorithms that reward outrage, false facts, and filter bubbles. This reward structure strengthens and further polarizes existing ideological factions. Nowhere has this been more evident than in the United States, a country already beholden to a binary two-party system has seen further polarization and less moderate outlook among its voters. Identity politics have become a game played by vocal minorities that distract us.The monopolization of internet services, followed by the prevalence of the engagement based model has divided us, so we can no longer agree on the truth.Today, we spend an increasing amount of our time on the internet and when we rely on these services to inform us, we become on a macro level \u2014 less informed. It\u2019s not too difficult to reason about how these patterns are already beginning to form something much more sinister.Widespread Nation State Mis-informationThe monopolization of our attention and the polarization of individual belief have made us targets for mass manipulation. Notable early examples of this have shown themselves in countries with big investments in mass media propaganda. Historically, the \u201cinfluence\u201d game was cemented on a universal truth: \u201ccredibility is king, and the truth will always win\u201d, however, in a world dominated by the ill effects of a broken internet, new manipulation strategies have emerged and the propaganda game is getting much more sophisticated. US based think tanks like RAND Corporation are increasingly focused on publishing reports with recommendations on how the US must learn to adapt and \u201ccompete\u201d with foreign state propaganda.From it \u2014Russian propaganda model is high-volume and multichannel, and it disseminates messages without regard for the truth. It is also rapid, continuous, and repetitive, and it lacks commitment to consistency. Although these techniques would seem to run counter to the received wisdom for successful information campaigns, research in psychology supports many of the most successful aspects of the model.\u201cA ceaseless shapeshifting, that is unstoppable, because it\u2019s indefinable.\u201d \u2014 Adam CurtisEven more concerning is that effective manipulation strategies are adopted by centralized authority of all kinds, and we don\u2019t need to venture far to see these influence tactics played out by those we are supposed to trust. It is becoming increasingly difficult to know what is real and with the consumer availability of technology like deepfake and lyrebird our definition of \u201creal\u201d is changing in parallel.Cheap, mainstream applications like lyrebird.ai are making it easy for anyone to spoof someone else with a small initial data set.No nation is immune to this, the end game is an undermining of societies perception of the world so that we never know what is really happening. A constantly changing piece of theatre and an effective subversion of our freedom. Left unchanged, the internet as it exists today will magnify society\u2019s illnesses, not limit them.\u2026However, there is hope.A Path ForwardThese issues have a continuum of public responses, from the defeatist attitude of surrender to the reactive regulatory efforts of Government to enforce consumer privacy and data ethics. Neither of which speak to the core challenge or provide a compelling and optimistic alternative.Legislation will not reverse these trendsIn a game of public opinion and four-year political cycles, it\u2019s very hard to see a path where legislation can keep up with the internet\u2019s pace of innovation. This disparity between legislations ability to update and the pace of technological innovation is amplified by the geographic boundaries governments face when imposing rules. We could look to inter-governmental bodies however their designs and bureaucracy impose speed reduction as a feature.\u201cThe internet is global and its impact is scaling quickly; governments are local and face natural scaling issues.\u201d \u2014 Matthew SpokeIf we were to rally behind a legislative solution, these internet giants will not let the debate wage without them influencing the conversation.A 2018 Facebook Campaign in Germany aimed at courting positive public opinion in relation to concerns over data privacy, hate speech and more.Can we fix the internet itself?A growing number of us are starting to believe that we have a chance to reverse course, by reforming the internet itself. Some have been labeling this movement web3, the third iteration of the internet.Web3 uses decades of innovation in cryptography, decentralized network design, digitally native assets, mechanism design and an increasing number of tools to rethink the core protocols that run the internet\u2019s underlying infrastructure.What kind of value do we get out of a new internet built on these innovations?It may be difficult to grasp now, but imagine an internet where you can prove who you are, or pay for something without the need for any centralized authority to confirm your identity or your account balance. The new internet has currency baked-in, which will allow applications powered by business models that align user and developer interests. Your data will be provably private, and you won\u2019t need to hand over control of it to gain access to the systems you enjoy. The new internet will change who owns the \u201cinventory\u201d of the network from a particular company to the initial creator. If you give the network value, you will be the recipient of it\u2019s value creation.We\u2019re still in the very early stages of reformation, but we\u2019ve seen progress. The Bitcoin project has proven that we can have an international currency without the need for a central bank. The Brave browser has proven that we can create consumer products that revert the ad model and pay you for your time and attention (involving users in the business). IPFS has proven that we can spin up distributed copies of websites like Wikipedia that can\u2019t be censored by dictatorial nation states. It\u2019s these early breakthroughs that give us hope, and we venture forward.However, we need help. Like any new movement, we lack mature thought leadership in specialized fields that are better equipped to help us navigate this reformation. We need a generation of reformers from economics and the sciences, as well as the humanities and engineering. We need artists and story tellers to spread the message. You made it to the end of this article, we need you!This post represents the first of a series we\u2019re calling \u201cThe Rebuild\u201d. Its purpose is to highlight humanities progress towards rebuilding the internet. We\u2019ll highlight projects that are paving new trails, patterns that are achieving success at scale, as well as our take on what the outcomes could look like.Please share this article and subscribe for updates as they become available. \ud83d\ude19\ud83d\udc4c", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Web3", "Internet", "Data Ethics", "Data Privacy", "Rebuild"]}, {"title": "Ethereum is blooming and we are doubling down on it", "post_link": "https://blog.gnosis.pm/ethereum-is-blooming-and-we-are-doubling-down-on-it-9cb486b170ff?source=search_post", "author_name": "Martin K\u00f6ppelmann", "author_link": "https://blog.gnosis.pm/@mkoeppelmann", "publish_date": "2018-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2018-08-17", "readtime": "1.30", "claps": 1759, "voters": 111, "content": "Ethereum is blooming and we are doubling down on itMartin K\u00f6ppelmannFollowAug 16, 2018 \u00b7 2 min readWe heard the Ether price dropped?

Defunct. If it were an elevator, there would be an Out of Order sign swinging from its doors. And yet we doggedly persevere, convincing ourselves that the internet we\u2019ve got is just fine.We didn\u2019t listen when the fathers of the internet declared their creation to be broken. It\u2019s not that we didn\u2019t respect Tim Berners-Lee and Vint Cerf; it\u2019s just that the truth hurts, even when it comes from such luminaries. So instead we buried our heads in the sand and our faces in Facebook and tried to carry on as normal.A short, sharp shockOh, the warning signs were there alright, that everything wasn\u2019t quite right in Internet Land. May 2013, when NSA contractor Edward Snowden fled to Hong Kong with a trove of classified documents which revealed the reach of the global surveillance industry. That was a wake-up call alright. For months, we were glued to those headlines as dragnet operation after dragnet operation came to light, each eroding a little more of our privacy and personal freedom. The revelations have scarcely stopped since, with 2017 seeing the release of Vault 7, Wikileaks files revealing the extent of the CIA\u2019s cyber warfare capacity.We were going to stop using Yahoo, we averred, after it emerged that one billion accounts had been compromised. Google too, after reports emerged of the NSA tapping into their data hubs. Switch to an encrypted email provider. Petition our congressman for a repeal of warrantless surveillance. We had such good intentions. Empowered and incensed, we were going to take back our freedom and make the web a safer and more discreet place for all.But then\u2026but then nothing. Everything just petered out and went back to normal. It was as if nothing had ever happened. It\u2019s not that we were lazy or brainwashed or incapable. It\u2019s just that change is uncomfortable. Disruption is \u2014 wait for it \u2014 disruptive and requires new behaviors that feel alien at first. The status quo, on the other hand, is warm and comfortable. It\u2019s what we\u2019ve always known and, for all its flaws, it works. Sort of. Some of the time.Sure, we\u2019re forced to endure untrustworthy corporations selling our data to governments, and governments spying on our every action, and centralized databases containing our personal details being hacked on a regular basis, but that\u2019s just the trade-off we make for the sake of progress, right?Dear citizens of the internet, what if I told you it doesn\u2019t have to be this way? That there\u2019s a better way of doing business, one which doesn\u2019t call for sacrificing your security or the convenience you\u2019ve become accustomed to? There\u2019s a new paradigm that has the potential to save us all and restore our right to privacy and security.Its name?Decentralization.Yeah, you\u2019ve heard that word before and you might even have experienced decentralization in action, whether it was purchasing a decentralized cryptocurrency or acquiring goods on a P2P marketplace. But when I invoke the D-word, I\u2019m not talking explicitly about distributed ledgers. Nor am I talking about P2P platforms with a UX that looks like a command line and a 9,000-page manual to master. Decentralization doesn\u2019t have to mean forgoing the comforts you\u2019re accustomed to.Rebuilding the web, one block at a timeIf dentralization is to wrestle control from the oligarchies that run our internet, it needs to be workable. Nimble. Accessible. And understandable to the average layman or woman on the web. It\u2019s a big ask, but it\u2019s one I firmly believe to be within our reach. I believe it\u2019s possible to leverage decentralization to create a better internet, one where the power resides with the many and not just the few. The decentralized web is all about handing data back to its rightful owner \u2014 the end user.A place where everyone controls their own data and no one is beholden to monopolies, despotic regimes, careless and faceless corporations, hackers, scammers, and bad actors. Everyone who would like to steal, surveil, and sell your data in other words. Centralization also raises the question of who owns your data and the services you pay for. Do you truly own your smartphone, for example, or are you effectively leasing it from a company who can withdraw the service at a moment\u2019s notice? As demonstrated by the case of Apple slowing the performance of its older iPhones, there are dangers with being beholden to a single service provider who calls the shots.That\u2019s not to say that organizations possessing your data is necessarily a bad thing; in fact it\u2019s a basic requisite to doing business on the web. Suppose you decided to allow a charitable foundation to access your data for the purposes of making a donation, for example. On the centralized web, you are largely powerless to dictate what third parties do with this information. On the decentralized web, you\u2019re able to consent to your data being used while still retaining control of it.The difference is that decentralization allows you to retain control of your personal information, right down to determining where it is stored. Think Siacoin instead of Dropbox in other words: the same basic concept \u2014 cloud storage \u2014 but very different solutions. On the decentralized web, options such as Storj or Sia split apart, encrypt, and distribute your files across the network. Since you hold the keys, you own your data. No outside company can access or control your files, unlike traditional cloud storage providers. Other solutions include IPFS, a peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol to make the web faster, safer, and more open.Nevertheless, it is imperative to be granted enough privacy to go about your business on the web, in confidence that eyes aren\u2019t prying and spies aren\u2019t spying. If the internet is your digital home then your data is your possessions in that home: yours and yours only, and certainly not be the property of ISPs, social networks, hackers, and governments to extract and freely trade.Campaigning for better online security is one thing of course. Implementing it in a manner that is accessible and usable for the world at large is quite another. Developers and hackers possess the skills to use complex privacy tools, but these are off-limits for less tech-savvy individuals. What\u2019s required is a decentralized set of tools that emulates the best aspects of the centralized tools we already have. Keep the UX, ditch the backdoors and sloppy security. Is it too much to ask?Web 2 > Web 3Decentralized open source software can be vetted by anyone and used by anyone. It comes with no hidden surprises or privileged access. By encrypting and storing data on the blockchain, the reliance on a single point of failure \u2014 centralized databases under the control of one entity \u2014 is removed. Once we embrace decentralization, and start working together to make this model our default web setting, the rest will follow: the user-friendly OS, the users themselves, and with it the heightened privacy and security.Ethereum is the obvious success story to date in decentralized computing, but it\u2019s just the beginning, Web 3.0. The technical details will get ironed out over time, and each subsequent iteration will bring a series of competing and ever-improving platforms, each clamoring to achieve the same objective \u2014 to make the web safer for you.Everyone has their own concept of privacy. Mine involves a web where I get to decide what information I share with whom. One where I control my data and my own sense of identity. A place where I can be sure my conversations are private and my email secure. Your own idea of private may differ, but I\u2019ll wager the fundamentals remain the same.The transition to decentralization won\u2019t happen overnight. It will take time, technology and education. To become free, first we must want to be free, and to yearn for a better way of your decentralize life. Web 2.0 might be broken, but the next iteration doesn\u2019t have to be. There will be false starts and setbacks, but what there won\u2019t be \u2014 can\u2019t be \u2014 is any going back. The decentralized computing era has already started.Join it and together let\u2019s make the web a better place.Personal Bio, Twitter, FacebookDon\u2019t miss the latest updates about our projects by subscribing to the newsletter.", "responses": 6, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Ethereum", "Web3", "Bitcoin", "Cryptocurrency"]}, {"title": "Stupid About \u2014 Blockchain", "post_link": "https://medium.com/web3studio/stupid-about-blockchain-51cb150b7e?source=search_post", "author_name": "John Wolpert", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@jwolpert", "publish_date": "2019-01-01", "last_modified_date": "2019-01-13", "readtime": "16.7", "claps": 962, "voters": 110, "content": "Stupid About \u2014 BlockchainA Smart Guide to the Emerging Technology Wilderness: 1.01John WolpertFollowJan 1 \u00b7 17 min readThe rules of blockchain:Rule #1 \u2014 You probably don\u2019t need blockchainRule #2 \u2014 You probably won\u2019t be able to live without blockchainRule #3 \u2014 By the time you need blockchain, you won\u2019t know you\u2019re using blockchainUPDATE Jan 13, 2019: New Story of a notStupid use of blockchain. Check it out: Bootleg.Photo by Hitesh Choudhary on UnsplashI once had to brief the leaders of a large enterprise on \u201cthis blockchain thing.\u201d Their customers were asking about it, and they needed answers. I spent hours with them. They managed to figure out how to spell it, but they weren\u2019t getting it. I don\u2019t think they ever really did. How \u201cstupid,\u201d right?But here\u2019s the thing. Those leaders are wickedly smart about getting 200,000 people to work together without running amok. They are smarter about that subject than I may ever be. (Not ruling it out.)This experience cemented a principle that has become important for me:You\u2019ve never met a stupid person\u2026just people desperately focused on being smart about something else.So the key is knowing what to focus on. And when it comes to emerging technologies like \u201cblockchain,\u201d often the stupidest thing to do is divert your limited human capacity for focus and spend that precious resource on shiny objects.A board member of a company I ran gave me another bit of advice \u2014 Pay attention to what you pay attention: \u201cWe will let you run the company, even when things aren\u2019t going well, so long as we think you\u2019re focused on the right things. But come to the board meeting with a jumble of metrics and no sense of which ones are important (and which ones aren\u2019t), and we might get rid of you even if the company is winning.\u201dOk \u2014 so I\u2019ve made the case that it\u2019s smart to be stupid about stuff like blockchain. End of story, right? Right! But\u2026Inventions and IntentionsYou have things you intend to do \u2014 problems to overcome and opportunities to capture. Your sense of what these are is based in part on what capabilities you think you have. Some inventions can change your intentions.I can invent, say, the pencil. I can show it to you, spin it around and point out its wonderful properties. And if you\u2019ve never seen one, you might be impressed by its smooth yellow sides, the odd rubbery thing on the top, and the sheer black tip on the other. But if you\u2019ve never written a word in your life, if you\u2019ve never encountered paper (a different invention) you\u2019ll probably find your gaze moving away, back to your daily concerns of how to get the field plowed before nightfall.But what if I show up to your farm as a bank\u2019s loan officer, present a stack of papers, and demand you sign them in order to keep your land. That pencil just got really interesting. You might use it to sign your name. You might use the rubber on top to erase it when you have second thoughts. Or you might notice the pencil\u2019s exquisite size, weight and pointyness and stick it in my eye! Now it\u2019s a \u201cdisruptive technology.\u201d (I probably deserved it\u2026bad, greedy banker.)So, you might not need to pay attention to an emerging technology like blockchain, but you do need to pay attention to your intentions\u2026and how they could be about to change.The Trough of AccelerationIntentions \u2014 that\u2019s what 2019 is about for savvy leaders of industry when it comes to blockchain and blockchain-related technology. It\u2019s the year where we can all start to sort out what we really intend to do in light of our changing capabilities.Why 2019? Because many signs show blockchain cleanly dropping over the peak of inflated expectations in Gartner\u2019s hype cycle. We either are in, or are approaching, the trough of disillusionment. And technologies that emerge from that often wind up changing the landscape of intentions, both yours and your community\u2019s.Until now, keeping blockchain in the periphery, assigning a few of your scouts to keep an eye on it, and knowing little more than how to spell it yourself was probably the smart thing for most serious industry leaders.Sure, the dreamers and futurists had a lot to say about blockchain in the last couple years. A few companies like IBM managed to use the buzzword to help re-invigorate sales of data services, mainframes and Cloud. But in your business, supplying real stuff to real people, you were smart. You stayed focused and doubled down on winning today\u2019s game. You marshaled your innovative capacity, not squandering it too soon and souring your people on lack-luster \u201cPOCs\u201d and disappointing early failures.Let the other guy try writing with that pencil before paper has been invented.But now, you might notice in 2019 a funny thing happening. Like a roller coaster, the greatest power and speed comes after going over the peak and racing to the bottom of the trough. If you see blockchain technology not disappearing at this point, then the notStupid thing to do is to get smart about it.Just as those too-early adopters suffer \u201cblockchain hangover\u201d and shut down projects, you can hit the gas and draft past them\u2026as long as you learn from their mistakes.Below are some things I\u2019ve learned from many mistakes.A Stupid Use of Enterprise BlockchainI attended a conference in 2018 where a very big company demonstrated their latest blockchain proof-of-concept, which they said was \u201cin production.\u201d (Really? In production in 2018? Really\u2026adorable.)The breathless evangelist extolled the virtues of their new \u201cblockchain for coffee.\u201d The major innovation? According to them, it was that now I could look up who grew the coffee beans in my delicious brew \u201cin under two seconds!\u201d Wow! Amazing! Um\u2026not.It might have taken 2 seconds for their magic blockchain to look up a bean grower from a QR code but it would have taken the same solution less than\u00a0.02 seconds if it had used any normal\u00a0database...perhaps a hearty noSQL\u00a0variety\u00a0for\u00a0extra\u00a0rich\u00a0flavor.Shortly after that conference, out of sheer frustration, I posted a tweet:I think I\u2019m going to give myself a 30 day challenge. Come up with an actually notStupid use of enterprise blockchain. I mean, one where a conventional database would not suffice. Would be a world first.https://twitter.com/jwolpert/status/1064204044238053376A lot of people appeared to be interested in that. Since then, I\u2019ve been posting daily some new pattern or use I\u2019ve observed under the moniker, #notStupidEnterpriseBlockchain.Ok, maybe the intentions of the coffee consuming community are evolving toward needing to know who grew the beans. I don\u2019t know. Seems like a nice thing to know, but I\u2019m not walking out of a cafe that can\u2019t tell me where a specific bag of beans came from. I\u2019m content to know that they buy from so-and-so. They\u2019re welcome to paint that on their wall in some cool font above the bar, and I might be pleased to read it while I wait for my brew. But it\u2019s not going to significantly change my behavior.There was, indeed, a change of intentions happening, but it wasn\u2019t what the evangelist was claiming. The change was that the blockchain company demoing the solution was able to use the bean grower\u2019s intention to get greater brand exposure:\u201cHey, I know you don\u2019t like to share your company\u2019s data, but if you put some of it in this shared database we call a blockchain, I\u2019ll put your brand in front of thousands of executives in Vegas\u2026I\u2019ll even put you-yourself on stage with our CEO.\u201dThe bean grower then might have asked, \u201cWhy would anyone care about our supply chain information?\u201d Normally, nobody would. You can\u2019t get 30,000 people to show up to a presentation about putting stuff into a database, but while the world approached the blockchain peak of inflated expectations in 2017 and 2018, you could do exactly that for a database called blockchain. Try that later in 2019 or 2020 and see what happens after the sweet taste of new new blockchain sours, and it becomes the last thing people want to talk about. Welcome to the trough.The lesson: Do blockchain and web3 projects that are notStupid. Because if you don\u2019t, you will only be adding to the skepticism of your team (and you) that the whole thing is \u201cjust tulips,\u201d a fad. Then you will join the ranks of the too-early adopters and be forgotten.Safe is DangerousAnother big lesson is less obvious in the coffee case, but here\u2019s what often happens. A company decides it wants to learn how to spell blockchain. Leaders are only mildly interested, but a few wild ducks in the company can\u2019t stop talking about it. So a small budget is allocated to do a \u201cPOC\u201d and explore a \u201cuse case.\u201d Typically, this thinking sets a key project parameter implicitly: do something easy, do something safe.Oddly, doing something safe is the most dangerous thing you can do at this stage in blockchain. It results in deciding to do a project that covers ground you have already covered with previous systems, known territory.The problem with covering a known use case is that your conventional systems have been tuning for it over many years. Blockchain, in its current state of maturity, will fail along virtually every measure of performance and functionality compared to what you already have.Imagine it\u2019s 2009 and you\u2019re building the first ridesharing app. In 2009, you can build a minimally viable product that does nothing more than paint cars moving around on a second-generation iPhone screen and let the user dial a dispatcher by touching the nearest car. In 2009, people lost their minds over just that, proving that showing the live position of your ride on your phone mattered to people. But imagine building that same \u201cMVP\u201d today. People would hate it. \u201cWhat\u2019s a dispatcher?\u201d they will ask. \u201cI can\u2019t hail the car? I can\u2019t phone the driver? I can\u2019t pay for the ride with the app?? This thing sucks!\u201d Today your experiment fails\u2026for the wrong reasons.Since 2015, I\u2019ve seen and been involved directly in many so-called blockchain projects that failed due to \u201cpave the cowpath\u201d syndrome. We built what the company asked for. Everything worked. The demo went off without a hitch, and then the notStupid executive reviewing the project inevitably said, \u201cRight\u2026thank you very much. That\u2019s a nice little project there. Goodbye.\u201d And that was it.The Lesson: Do projects that are just as, or even more, compact and simple as the \u201cstupid\u201d coffee project, but make sure they are exploring new territory. AND make sure that the territory being explored has a good chance of revealing a game-changing new opportunity that would be too good for the company to pass up, if proven. Build the 2009 ridesharing app that opens peoples\u2019 eyes to the possibilities, not the 2019 poor-excuse-for-an-Uber-clone.Spend the small amount of extra time getting rigorously creative about the project before choosing the dangerously safe option, and you might find a notStupid use of blockchain.notStupid Uses of Blockchain in IndustryThere really are some notStupid uses of blockchain and related technology (Web3), and there will be a lot more soon.I didn\u2019t find as many projects out there on my \u201c30 day notStupid Enterprise Blockchain Challenge\u201d as I had hoped. But I did find a few, and they highlight good principles to develop more. For example, CLS completed a project recently that stands up to at least one of the criteria below, though not all.A notStupid use of industrial blockchain starts with the right intentions:There must be more than a few legally-separate parties that intend to collaborate for reasons that will persist beyond the honeymoon period, usually to overcome a problem or capture an opportunity which is \u2014 or can be \u2014 financially material or strategically significant to them;The parties must intend to control their own part of the infrastructure and prevent any other party having administrative or hegemonic control over the system or the business rules;The parties must intend to achieve true tamper resistance of the data, which means that they can assure anyone that they did not collude to tamper with the ledger, alter business rules or censor transactions; [Note \u2014 a private permissioned \u201cblockchain\u201d between, say, a few banks can not claim true tamper resistance unless they are using something like Chainpoint or Kaleido to hash (notarize) state to a mainnet like Ethereum or Bitcoin.]The parties must intend to maintain surveillance resistance, ensuring that confidential business rules and transactions are not only kept private but their existence is known only to the involved parties, which means some parties even inside a permissioned private network must not always be able to see what other parties in the network are doing;The essential data involved must be novel digital assets.This last one is critical and deserves explanation. Using blockchain simply to share information, like the date your bananas showed up at a port, isn\u2019t going to cut it. Is it a good exercise to start with? I\u2019d say no, but maybe it\u2019s ok, if there is a strong commitment to ignore the results of the POC and move immediately on to something more powerful that fits the criteria above.However, if parties are trading digital assets, which must be proof against double-spend, then employing some kind of blockchain starts to be notStupid. And it becomes essential when:The assets are too sensitive or valuable to trust their management to any one entity, even a joint venture;The volume of trade rises to a point where participants begin to worry about the power they will be handing over to a controlling entity;Achieving a new degree of fluidity and inclusion drives the need for tiny and free-flowing trades between a wide array of parties, not just a few enterprises;The parties intend not simply to move inert assets around but to use novel asset structures to change incentives and alter the game in their industry.If you aren\u2019t exploring ways to change something about the game rules of your industry, then the probability that your intentions require the use of blockchain technology is low.It\u2019s the Internet, StupidStarting in 2019 or 2020, blockchain and related infrastructure (Web3) will begin to support these intentions. This is when we will begin to have an always-on, universally accessible infrastructure, an evolution of the Internet, which can allow parties to:Quickly look each other up on a global registry (ENS?);Instantly spin up an on-demand virtual sidechain;Make secret but final transactions;Conduct confidential agreements that can seamlessly interoperate with code on other sidechains and mainnets;Do this without exposing confidential business rules or transactions to each other or the public.Can you set up a private network or use blockchain-as-a-service offerings to create a shared database for a consortium today? Sure. But it\u2019s akin to setting up an Extranet (remember those?). It\u2019s doable, but the sheer effort and time involved simply in organizing the parties manually raises the bar to the level of effort that begs the question: why not use conventional systems with tried-and-true security and fine-grained access controls?The difference between the soon-to-be \u201cstateful Internet\u201d and today\u2019s enterprise blockchain networks is like the difference between companies collaborating via public APIs and SDKs (like a ridesharing app using Google Maps) and companies spending months to negotiate a strategic partnership.If you can justify the effort of setting up a private, balkanized consortium blockchain, then you probably didn\u2019t need blockchain. And this will be especially apparent after blockchain loses its ability as a shiny object to attract membership.Patterns and Suggestions for notStupid ProjectsHere are some cases, lessons and patterns I picked up on my quest to find notStupid enterprise blockchain projects last month.Through 2019, my team at ConsenSys Web3Studio will publish more real cases with real code and great documentation. If you want to explore ways to change the game in your industry with us \u2014 or at least become a good story in an upcoming book on the subject \u2014 reach out\u2026we\u2019re easy to find.Start with conventional technology & focus on game designThe smartest use of industrial blockchain I saw this year\u200a\u2014\u200aa venture capital network\u200acalled Coven\u2014\u200aran for several months on an Excel spreadsheet. Their focus was on tuning the incentives of different players and making it a better game that organically helps deal finders, reviewers and investors be more aligned, fluid and accountable.While this operation was testing out scenarios on very small deals with very small numbers of investments, Excel and Slack were not only more-than-adequate as the system of record, they were essential. It forced the team to focus on mechanism design, the game. And it allowed them to get the business rules (which ultimately will become immutable smart contracts) correct and tested before deploying them on a blockchain.Once they got the basic game stable, and as the deal sizes and volumes increased, going to a web-based SaaS application with a traditional database sufficed for a while. But now, as things really start to expand, participation increases, and assets become seriously material (and as making a mistake with them becomes a major liability), the need for the judicious use of blockchain is apparent.This is also a good example of how blockchain shouldn\u2019t be the centerpiece of a Web3 project. Here, most of the system that lets users log on and find deals will always be SaaS, but the component that manages keeping track of who earned what and transfers assets between parties will be (must be) done on something like a blockchain.Here is a key theme I suspect we\u2019ll be seeing through 2019 and 2020:This project really needs the surveillance-resistance of a private blockchain (really of a traditional, well-administrated database) while also removing the organizer from the liability of maintaining the system and ensuring the integrity of the ledger.It needs a stateful Internet, one where not only strong privacy but also strong confidentiality (data and code-execution segregation) can be ensured. They can\u2019t simply put the private dealings of investors and stealth startups directly on one of today\u2019s public blockchain mainnets, the digital equivalent of nudist colonies. Nor can they maintain private ledgers they control without becoming a single point of failure and incurring a lot of risk \u2014 risk that will result in high fees gumming up the system and turning the whole affair back into the same old game they were trying to change.I can\u2019t speak for the organizers of this project, but I expect that this kind of pattern will proliferate when we have proven out sidechain technology like Plasma/Layer2/etc\u2026and especially when virtual on-demand sidechains can be spun up across millions of standing edge devices running secure enclaves and other fancy tech. (See this story for one vision of this.)Standards before NetworksAn industrial-strength version of the venture capital case is starting to form around the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA), a large body of companies trying to develop standards for Web3.The urge for many middle-managers asked by their boss to \u201cdo something with blockchain,\u201d is to set up some kind of network, maybe concoct some kind of \u201cwallet\u201d for employees to tinker with. Meh.But for some companies \u2014 Oracle and SAP come to mind \u2014 they have the ultimate examples of well-researched industrial game designs that have been operating for years. Oracle Apps and Ariba have long managed the rules of many industry games, albeit using conventional technology.They could now start \u201cpaving the cowpath\u201d and standing up blockchain networks as poor approximations of these powerhouse industry applications.Or instead, they could first write standards based on these apps \u2014 from complex business logic to the simple standard that says, \u201cUse fName, not firstname, as the field for a user\u2019s first name.\u201d They could bake these into something like an ERC (Ethereum Request for Comment) and promulgate it through the EEA. Then any new networks, subnets, sidechains, etc. that launch in the future can be confident they can interop with any other system that implements the ERC.CloudCoinHere\u2019s a good example of how the community\u2019s intentions are already changing as a result of blockchain and Web3 principles rising. There are already cloud computing customers asking to spread their data, compute and bandwidth across multiple clouds, so that no one provider has enough customer information to result in a data breach if hacked.But they don\u2019t want to have to manage multiple clouds and get multiple bills. As this customer intention rises to become a real market, smart cloud providers will be able to make more money together than on their own. And I\u2019ll predict that today\u2019s second-tier clouds will start the game working together, because they will see the opportunity to out-scale the leader. I don\u2019t know if it will be called \u201ccloudcoin\u201d (someone has that URL), but expect this to be a thing in the next few years.Blind TransparencyThe pattern that really makes sense to me for industrial blockchain (and again, requires this hybrid \u201cpublic/private\u201d infrastructure) can be described this way:Three companies walk into a bar. They all need to know that none of them are too drunk to drive home, but Company A can\u2019t know that Company B just bought Company C a drink.Ok\u2026that might make no sense on its face, but I think it\u2019s hilarious. The sober way to explain this is to consider all the cases where companies need to get a verified signal that everyone agrees is important for the whole industry, but where nobody should have access to the information required to generate that signal.Take medicine: Preventing participants in clinical trials of new drugs from joining more than one study is kind of important. For one thing, taking more than one experimental drug will probably kill you. And for another, it will invalidate both studies. The trial organizers (the drug company and others) need to know you aren\u2019t in another study when you show up, but they can\u2019t know anything about anyone else\u2019s study, for obvious reasons. We can\u2019t publish a big Google spreadsheet and have everyone list their trials and participants.If an industry can trust a single entity to be the black-box of this information, then the problem is trivial. And indeed, for this problem, a company called VCT does the job.But think of all the problems that fit this pattern in your industry that simply don\u2019t rise to the urgency of the VCT case. (And while I haven\u2019t spoken to the leaders of VCT\u2026yet\u2026I bet they had a jolly fun time getting companies across the globe to participate. Bet it took years and cost them millions.)Advances in Web3 technologies should enable a low-cost, universally available, tamper resistant black-box where no human has access to the information that generates, say, a true/false signal based on a query.Think what you could do with that.VIA: Value Introspection and AttestationEver have to deal with VAT tax? It\u2019s a hassle. Value added tax \u2014 common in Europe \u2014 means you have to keep track of all the stages of manufacturing and distribution of a product. You don\u2019t just tax the item at point of sale once. You hit everyone that contributes something to the finished good. What a nightmare.But in a mature stateful Internet, the matter can become trivial (assuming we are talking about a pervasive and precocious regime where buyers and suppliers are using and integrating workflows with blockchain the way they pass messages via email today). Each step can be treated as an asset, which is part of a composition of assets that make up the actual product.Imagine this pattern applied in more novel ways than tax. What if a buyer of a dress could tip the person who sewed the dress without a supervisor finding out and trying to garnish it?Have a few drinks and ponder this one.Post-Coasian CompaniesThere are other patterns and cases that I turned up, but here\u2019s the last one for now, and it\u2019s the most radical.Ronald Coase published his theory of the firm in 1937, arguing that founders decide to organize into firms to avoid search, contracting and other transaction costs necessary if they organized as a market. (Please feel free to quibble with my paraphrasing.)With modern IT and Web3 rails, it is conceivable for some genius, Will Wright-like founder to construct an efficient market game for their firm\u2026or even a cluster of firms operating in a mesh. Everything (or most things), including leadership, becomes an atomic service. You can contract with me for \u201cthis is the guy to call if you have a problem with me that you can\u2019t tell me about directly\u201d services. What if the daily scrum became the basis of how everyone\u2019s bonus were calculated? See this experiment for details.Crazy? Maybe. Happening now? Yep. That\u2019s why I like working at ConsenSys.What do you intend to do?Innovation is a sentence constructed of nouns and verbs. Inventions are the nouns. Intentions are the verbs.A bunch of people are building a magic pencil called Web3 that has a sharp black tip called blockchain.The question for 2019 and beyond: Are you going to leave it there on the table, write something with it, or stick it in someone\u2019s eye?The next time you ask someone to help you figure out \u201cthis blockchain thing,\u201d keep an eye on your intentions and how they change as you figure out what this thing can do.Work in ProgressThis article will undergo ongoing upgrades. It is decidedly not yet a notStupid version of the blockchain story. Help make it better.

It will explore HD wallets, how they\u2019re built, and how to use them in Ethereum.What exactly is an HD wallet?Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets (or HD wallets for short) were introduced by BIP 32 and later improved by BIP 44. BIPs (if you\u2019re not familiar with them) stand for Bitcoin Improvement Proposal. Why are we talking about Bitcoin right now? You should take a look at The History of the space for context. Although the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks are incredibly different today, there are still a lot of similarities to be found between the two currencies. Turns out BIP 32 + BIP 44 provided a network agnostic method of generating secure keys in an incredibly flexible manner, a method used by the vast majority of cryptocurrencies.But what is an HD wallet? Put simply, an HD wallet is a public/private key tree all starting from a master node (not like the Master Nodes of DASH). Here\u2019s a great image for visualization:The tree is represented by derivation paths. The default for Ethereum is m/44'/60'/0'/0. Each number in that path represents a certain level in the tree above.m / purpose' / coin_type' / account' / change / address_index44 \u2014 BIP 44 Purpose60 \u2014 Ethereum\u2019s coin type0 \u2014 Account 00 \u2014 Chain 0Technically speaking, Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets are a tree structure where each node has an extended private and public key. Any node can have any number of children. Meaning a master key could control 10 accounts in 10 different currencies each with a very high number of addresses. I chose 10 as an arbitrary number, the number could be as large as you\u2019d like.Keep in mind that Ethereum treats every address as an account, so the best purpose of an HD Wallet would be to manage many accounts from a single master private key. For more reading on the pros and cons of HD Wallets see this article by BitcoinMagazineFor further reading on HD wallets look at my article: HD Wallets ExplainedHow to Build an Ethereum HD Wallet in node.jsNow we know that an HD Wallet is really just a tree of nodes each with a public and private key and each depth height representing a specific function. First we will create a mnemonic, create an address out of it, and then create a raw transaction and broadcast it on the Ropsten Test Net. Time to build one!Requirementsbip39 (for mnemonic generation)hdkey (implementation of BIP 32)ethereumjs-util (henceforth ethUtil)ethereumjs-tx (henceforth ethTx)web3 (for communicating to an Ethereum node)Note: If you are using ethereumjs-util/hdkey, you don\u2019t necessarily have to follow the code here. This file provides a ton of awesome helper functions! You can follow along and get the same functionality however.Master Private Key and Address generationHow do you start a tree? By beginning at the node. Now, HD Wallets are created by a random bit of data called a seed. We will create a mnemonic and convert that mnemonic to a seed. For those unaware as to what a mnemonic is, here is a quote from the bitcoin wiki.A simplified explanation of how mnemonic phrases work is that the wallet software has a wordlist taken from a dictionary, with each word assigned to a number. The mnemonic phrase can be converted to a number which is used as the seed to a deterministic wallet that generates all the key pairs used in the wallet.const mnemonic = bip39.generateMnemonic(); //generates stringconst seed = bip39.mnemonicToSeed(mnemonic); //creates seed bufferNow that we have our entropy in the format we need it in, it\u2019s time to generate the root of the node tree. We can also get our masterPrivateKey and hold onto it from here as well.const root = hdkey.fromMasterSeed(seed);const masterPrivateKey = root.privateKey.toString('hex');Note: Treat your root.publicKey as securely as you would treat your masterPrivateKey as you can still generate the addresses without it.Now in Ethereum each address is considered an account. Don\u2019t get confused by the picture above that has wallets/accounts at depth 1. Truth be told an HD wallets isn\u2019t the best choice for a purely Ethereum wallet but who am I to judge why you\u2019re here \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af.To create a single address we\u2019ll derive an address node. And then extract the address out of it.const addrNode = root.derive(\"m/44'/60'/0'/0/0\"); //line 1const pubKey = ethUtil.privateToPublic(addrNode._privateKey);const addr = ethUtil.publicToAddress(pubKey).toString('hex');const address = ethUtil.toChecksumAddress(addr);/*   If using ethereumjs-wallet instead do after line 1:   const address = addrNode.getWallet().getChecksumAddressString();*/And Bob\u2019s your uncle you have successfully created a checksum address from a mnemonic! You can verify your own results by putting your mnemonic in this website and seeing if the addresses work out correctly. Make sure to use the BIP 44 Derivation Path and select Ethereum.Constructing, Signing, and Broadcasting TransactionsNow that we have our address and the associated private key, let\u2019s have some fun and spend some money!First, go to a faucet and get a top up. Metamask has a nice Ropsten faucet! We\u2019ll be performing this transaction across the Ropsten testnet, for more information on the different testnets and why they exist take a look at this stack overflow post.To use the Metamask faucet, make sure you have the Metamask plugin installed, the network set to \u201cRopsten Test Net\u201d, log out of your current session, and import your wallet with the mnemonic seed phrase. Once there, compare the address in Metamask with the string stored in theaddress variable. If all has gone well, it should be the same. Now get an ether from the faucet!Now that we\u2019re loaded up it\u2019s time to construct our transaction. Our transaction will have the following parametersnonce \u2014 transaction nonce, security feature that prevents double spendingto \u2014 the address to whom the funds are to be sentvalue \u2014 the amount in WEI* to be sent in hexadecimal or decimalgasPricegasLimitchainId \u2014 1 for mainnet, 3 for Ropsten testnet. Here\u2019s a complete list*1 ether = 1 x 10\u00b9\u2078 WEIGasPrice and gasLimit are a bit difficult to explain concisely, but I\u2019ll do my best. Think of the Ethereum network as a large computer. It can support advanced logic in the form of smart contracts, but even sending a simple value transaction is logic that needs to be processed, and in Ethereum every execution has a price. Since gas is a unit of measuring the computational work, the gasPrice is the cost per execution. You can think of it as the cost per gallon of fuel in a car.If the gasPrice is the cost per gallon of fuel, then the gasLimit is the capacity of the fuel tank. It is the highest number of gas that can spent execution a transaction. This limit serves to protect people from an erroneously constructed smart contract that would endlessly execute spending ethereum from the address forever until the address is depleted.Once you have your parameters set up, they should look a bit like thisconst params = {  nonce: 0,  to: '0x4584158529818ef77D1142bEeb0b6648BD8eDb2f',  value: '0.1',  gasPrice: 5000000000,  gasLimit: 21000,  chainId: 3};Now to create and serialize the transaction which is what we\u2019ll broadcast across the Ethereum testnet.const tx = new ethTx(params);//Signing the transaction with the correct private keytx.sign(addrNode._privateKey);const serializedTx = tx.serialize()We have now constructed and bundled up our signed transaction. All that\u2019s left is to broadcast it. There are a few ways to go about this:Via etherscan.io using their public eth_sendRawTransaction endpointVia infura.io which will give you access to an ethereum node serversideVia a local geth nodeWe\u2019ll go with a local geth node. I\u2019m assuming you have a mac (Boo if you don\u2019t) but if you don\u2019t just use that handy dandy Google.com site and look up the well documented instructions.For mac users\u2026$ brew tap ethereum/ethereum$ brew install ethereum\u2026and you\u2019re good to go.Now for everyone get your geth node up with the following flags which will start the node on testnet and boot up the WS-RPC server we\u2019ll need for web3.$ geth --testnet --wsNow that we have our geth server up we can connect to it using web3.js, an api by the Ethereum Foundation that exposes a ton of functionality from the geth node.const web3 = new Web3(   new Web3.providers.HttpProvider('http://localhost:8545'));//Verify connection is successfulweb3.eth.net.isListening()   .then(() => console.log('is connected'))   .catch(e => console.log('Wow. Something went wrong'));And now we can finally broadcast our transaction which we constructed by hand across the Ethereum (testnet) Universe and return the transaction hash.Web3.eth.sendSignedTransaction(   `0x${serializedTx.toString('hex')}`,    (error, result) => {       if (error) { console.log(`Error: ${error}`); }        else { console.log(`Result: ${result}`); }    } );Toss the transaction hash into ropsten.etherscan.io to verify that you\u2019ve done everything right!Writer\u2019s Note: It is possible to do all this for mobile using react-native although some shimming will be required to get the node modules to work. If there\u2019s interest in it I can write up a How-To article for that.Some other articles and resources of note:HD Wallets Explained43 Technical Facts about BitcoinSo You Want To Build a Bitcoin HD Wallet?Mnemonic Code ConverterGobittest43 Technical Facts About Bitcoin", "responses": 7, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Ethereum Blockchain", "Ethereum Wallet", "Web3", "Geth"]}, {"title": "Fully Functioning DApp Browser for Mobile available in Trust Wallet", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@trustwallet/fully-featured-dapp-browser-for-mobile-4d062a0c66cb?source=search_post", "author_name": "Trust Wallet", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@trustwallet", "publish_date": "2018-02-27", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-21", "readtime": "2.94", "claps": 969, "voters": 92, "content": "Fully Functioning DApp Browser for Mobile available in Trust WalletTrust WalletFollowFeb 27, 2018 \u00b7 3 min readToo lazy to read the article? Skip to the video and try the browser for yourself!How it all began.Originally, Trust Wallet was created because we couldn\u2019t find a wallet that had features that we (or any other beginning investor) needed to work with digital assets. Since the majority of the Ethereum market was taken over by ERC20 tokens, we decided to start small and build a tool to comfortably work with them. We knew that the process of manually adding tokens was too difficult, so we created a way to automatically detect any ERC20 token. In a few short weeks it generated thousands of users.We knew that we had something special. However, to stay relevant, we needed to execute and to do the job right from the start. Unlike anything else on the market, we built Trust Wallet in native code \u2014 in Swift on iOS and in Java on Android. Why? Because we wanted to build an application that was light and simple on the surface and solid and stable under the hood.Now that we had a great place to store tokens, we had to give our users ability to use them. That is usually done through decentralized applications (DApps), so we needed to implement a solution that that would allow us to work with them. MetaMask was too clunky and slow, limited to web \u2014 Chrome/Brave \u2014 users, so that didn\u2019t work. We tried a couple other solutions but it soon became pretty clear that Trust Wallet, an application built with simplicity and security in mind, needed something native and fast.First working mobile DApps browser is here!Kyber Network (Decentralized Exchange), CryptoKitties (Collectible), Name Bazaar (ENS marketplace)DApp browser is a culmination of many hours of effort that we put into perfecting practicality, usability and design. We created something that allows any Trust Wallet user to interact with decentralized applications (DApps) directly from the app, safely and securely. From getting CryptoKitties to exchanging tokens, through a network of partners, we allow our users to become true masters of their digital assets.To make our users\u2019 lives even easier, we also created a marketplace where any developer can list their mobile optimized DApp for everyone to use! We constantly maintain and adjust this open source repo of DApps to make sure that they work on Trust Browser on both iOS and Android. (Feel free to reach out to us, we can help test and optimize your DApp for mobile.)How about an example?You probably remember using Bittrex, Poloniex or similar exchanges on the web. They all share major security risks and general inconveniences \u2014 requiring a separate password to login, controlling your assets, operating only on desktop when the market is always active. Instead, we suggest you try KyberNetwork DApp through Trust Wallet. It is a decentralized exchange that allows you to trade a large variety of tokens in less than 30 seconds! Why should you pay network fees to transfer assets between your wallet and exchange when you can do transactions directly from your wallet?What\u2019s next?The next step is to continue building relationships with DApp builders and other developers. We want to create a community of decentralized applications that can be accessed by anyone with a mobile device. So far we have been very successful at that so you can rest assured that more DApps integrated with Trust Wallet will be coming your way in the near future.Download Trust Wallet and try it our for yourself!Google Play Store \u2014 Android AppApp Store \u2014 iOS AppHelping community by open sourcing.We want to help the community by keeping our source code open (both iOS and previous version of Android*).

Today I will describe how it works at a high level, and help you understand cross-chain transaction relaying.The more complex aspects of the technology, such as Polkadot\u2019s POS consensus algorithm and its relay chain specifications will be covered in later posts.Thanks to Peter Czaban, for spending the time imbuing me with his technical expertise and of course to Gavin Wood, for having written a paper that\u2019s both clear and concise while allowing me to paraphrase some of his Polkadot riot channel comments. Thanks also to both Rob Habermeir and Edward Thomson for taking the time to review this document.Benefits summaryFirstly, here\u2019s a quick lexicon reminder: a \u201cparachain\u201d references any existing or future blockchain connected to the Polkadot relay chain. And a \u201cstate machine\u201d is simply the brains or \u201cCPU\u201d of any given chain (in the case of Ethereum, that would be the EVM). State machines aggregate then process the changes engendered by each transaction broadcasted on the network. This is why you may have sometimes heard of \u201cstate transition functions\u201d \u2014 essentially they modify the \u201cstate\u201d of a chain to a new one, taking into account what has been updated, added or deleted.Any message can be sent from one parachain to another through the Polkadot relay chain. These messages can, for example, trigger a smart contract method. These methods, in turn, can then accomplish anything the parachain\u2019s state machine is capable of.These could include, depending on the parachain\u2019s capabilities:Linking private to public chains (e.g. IBM Hyperledger contracts calling others contracts living on the Ethereum public chain and then proceeding based on the returned results)Allowing cross chain value transfers (e.g. sending Zcash to the bitcoin network, or ether to the bitcoin network)Smooth migration to newer/better chains : tired of current chain? Just \u201ctransition\u201d to the new kid on the block (chain)Access to the execution of complex operations currently unavailable on existing platform due to constraints such as missing support for floating point arithmetic operationsDirect access to oracles and other authenticated data feeds for smart contractsIt\u2019s very important to understand that different state machines can be used for different tasks:Some have very small state proofs making it easier to implement efficient light clients, often by using simple state machines limited to token transacting (such as Waves)Some make privacy simpler (such as Zcash)Some are designed with enterprise permissioning in mind (such as Iroha)Some might be better suited to formal verification (such as Tezos)So, how does Polkadot actually work?While the official whitepaper might remain arcane to many, the actual implementation is (thankfully) fairly easy to understand.\u201cInterchain transactions are effectively indistinguishable from standard externally- signed transactions.\u201d In plain English, this means relay-chain maintainers called \u2018validators\u2019 manually move transactions from the output queue of the original parachain into the input queue of the destination parachain. The validators verify state transitions by running nodes of any given parachain. They are what\u2019s called \u201cbonded\u201d \u2014 meaning they put down a security deposit which they\u2019d lose if caught behaving improperly. That\u2019s it for the basic concept.This has an important implication: how many chains Polkadot ends up supporting is intrinsically linked to how many implementations of such relay contracts are developed. Some will require a modest amount of work, while other are far less trivial and may even only prove possible if the maintainers of the chains in question \u201cplay ball\u201d.To date, only parts of Polkadot have been built, and the project will probably only start in earnest once funded. For this reason, everything in this series of blogs must be considered as tentative only, since the actual implementation of Polkadot could change quite a bit between now and its release.Let\u2019s take a look at a four practical examples. \u201cChains\u201d varies wildly in terms of implementation and therefore eventual compatibility, so I had to select an array of technologies that gave a broad overview of the opportunities and challenges ahead.Ethereum-like solutions and PolkadotEthereum is the current gold standard for smart contract implementation and most enterprise private chains have selected it as their platform of choice. To interconnect Polkadot to Ethereum and all \u201cEthereum-like\u201d chains is critical to the success of the project, as it would mark the beginning of an interoperability standard between Polkadot and most \u201cpermissioned chains\u201d currently in various levels of development at Fortune 500 companies.Polkadot to Ethereum transaction routing takes essentially the form of a Solidity smart contract called a \u201cbreak-in\u201d contract. The process of moving Polkadot relay chain data into Ethereum is incentivized through a payment disbursed to anyone forwarding a useful block with a valid header.The currently estimated price of operating the Ethereum-forwarding bridge is approximately 540,000 gas per day. It\u2019s therefore fair to say that the ongoing cost of this contract, especially as Ethereum is set to scale-up through its own R&D, will be reasonable (the Polkadot paper references USD $45 a year, which might be a bit optimistic but still give a good sense of scale). A single basic transaction forwarded over the bridge would cost around $0.11; additional contract computation would evidently cost more.Various buffering and bundling transactions strategies will further help keep the costs down over time.A lot of these performance and cost improvements depend heavily on the development of Ethereum itself. Should Ethereum introduce primitives such as Schnorr signatures as part of their Metropolis (or other) fork, we could see a near zero overhead above basic costs for validating the signature and executing underlying transactions.The other way around (Ethereum to Polkadot) would work in a similar way. An Ethereum contract trying to contact a parachain part of Polkadot would use a \u2018break-out\u2019 solidity contract. That contract would take payment and use the \u2018log\u2019 instruction built-in Ethereum to prove its existence. Validity will be required from the validators running a full node, but lightweight methods are conceivable, which includes the use of third-parties submitting proof of invalid headers and punishing impostors.Bitcoin-like solutions and PolkadotWhile integrating smart contract enabled chains (especially EVM-enabled chains) to Ethereum seems to be a given milestone in the Polkadot roadmap, it would be foolish to ignore the granddaddy of cryptocurrencies and current total market capitalization leader, bitcoin.Polkadot to Ethereum interactions rely on the fact that Ethereum is perfectly able to host both break-in and break-out contracts with a total of say, 144 validators rotated daily (note that number was chosen arbitrarily \u2014 as the more validators, the better). Furthermore, Ethereum\u2019s constantly evolving nature leaves the door open for even more efficiencies in terms of validation through the introduction of new features via hard forks.Unfortunately, the current bitcoin implementation has a far, far more limited feature set, with most clients accepting only multisig with a maximum of 3 parties. To extend this to a higher number, never mind 144, would require for bitcoin to update its protocol via a hard fork, something that has historically been proven to be difficult to coordinate. And while the regular introduction of new features are received positively within the Ethereum ecosystem (just check out this upcoming list of changes in Metropolis), hard forks are severely frowned upon in the bitcoin world.This is a problem because the security of the deposits (\u201cbonds\u201d) scales with the rotation of the validators. One solution would be to operate with a smaller, but more heavily bonded validator set, but this would also require setting an upper limit to the amount of funds that could be exchanged between the two blockchains.It\u2019s not impossible that we will one day see a bitcoin parachain, as you probably know that a bitcoin fork of some kind is around the corner. It\u2019s been said that the supporters of the bitcoin segwit fork are also open to new ideas such as Schnorr signatures, which would considerably simplify integration. Regardless, it\u2019s likely we\u2019ll see Polkadot to bitcoin integration take place only after the more straightforward Ethereum interoperability because of the cooperation required between stakeholders (read: the development communities).IOTA-like solutions and PolkadotOut of the many projects out there in the blockchain space, some including IOTA rely neither on blocks nor chain. This creates a set of challenges I thought would be valuable to study as it will help us gauge the limit of \u201cchain\u201d interoperability as we understand it today.Paraphrasing Gavin Wood comments on the matter \u2014 the issue is IOTA doesn\u2019t have any kind of globally definite state or transactions, and as such producing a light-client proof that a given transaction has happened is basically impossible. Since producing such proof is one of the two key requirements of Polkadot for integrating sovereign \u201cchains\u201d, it would be a non-trivial, and possibly impractical task.IOTA isn\u2019t a blockchain but rather a DAG. As such, there is no \u201cparent hash\u201d to track which transactions have happened. Essentially, you need to constantly track a globally-defined state as it becomes practically final. This absolute finality itself isn\u2019t a great issue, as practical finality is enough (i.e. the \u201ccommunity defined\u201d 120 blocks for Ethereum and 6 block for Bitcoin).However, the globally-defined state is really important. IOTA only seems to give practical finality in fragmented and not-necessarily linearly-correspondent pieces.The good news? There could probably be some form of workaround, including \u2014 as suggested by Gavin Wood \u2014 maintaining a separate merkle tree of all transactions of at least a certain amount of depth in the DAG and treating that merkle root as the global state.Cosmos-like solutions and PolkadotPolkadot is not the only project out there promising chain-to-chain interoperability, even though it\u2019s currently the only one supporting remote smart contract method calls across chains, while other focus on the value exchange side of things. So, how would Polkadot interoperability solution integrate with another token exchange solution, such as Cosmos? Let\u2019s have a look.Paraphrasing Gavin Wood once again, we\u2019ve seen little reason to believe Cosmos would ever connect outside of the \u201ctendermint universe\u201d. Polkadot, on the other hand, makes very few assumptions about its own parachains; a transition-specifying block can be independently and quickly verified in relation to a parent hash (a \u201clight-client\u201d) and there are some means for the validators to exert their collective authority.That said, should Cosmos were able to make some sort of interconnection, then there\u2019s no reason Polkadot would not. Cosmos is designed for interconnecting specifically tendermint token chains. It has some low-level messaging protocol, it\u2019s trust-bound and this is heavily reliant on certain aspects of the tendermint model such as instant finality.So, what\u2019s in it for us developers?As a blockchain developer, you will probably want to \u2018mix and match\u2019 state machine functionality as no chain currently support all features, no matter what their marketing teams might claim. I personally do not think this situation will change for many years to come, to the contrary, if anything I believe fragmentation will only be on the increase.It\u2019s likely that if you are serious about blockchain development beyond PoCs, you will find yourself in a situation where you\u2019ll need to create you very own state transition engine, specific to your industry vertical (healthcare, legal, IoT, etc) with its own (sometime regulatory framework imposed) characteristics. This is where Polkadot shines.Just like web frameworks allow developers to focus on their site functionality and not worry about the underlying \u201cplumbing\u201d, Polkadot gives you a playground for building state machines where both communications and state transitions have their security guaranteed by the whole Polkadot relay chain stake (the collective \u2018bonds\u2019). You won\u2019t need to worry about acquiring a minimum threshold or a well distributed community of miners, for example, which in themselves are tremendous catch-22 challenges to overcome for fledgling projects.Furthermore, Polkadot brings a single finalization mechanism for all chains. Finality simply means the point at which transactions up to that block in any given chain is considered \u2018canonical\u2019 \u2014 in other words, the \u201ctrue\u201d\u2019 state of the chain at that particular moment. Some blockchains, like Ethereum and Bitcoin, define finality by forming a community/exchanges consensus around a certain number of blocks having passed. That number is roughly 120 for the Ethereum Homestead release and 6 for bitcoin. Other chains use different mechanisms and have finalization \u201cbuilt-in\u201d.When adopting Polkadot, parachains essentially give up sovereignty of finalization in exchange for the capability to interact with each other.Last but not least, a standardized messaging queue is provided for you \u2014 all the routing is done as part of the validation process, which translates into an easy on-boarding for developers. Your transactions are guaranteed to be routed to the right parachain, no matter what.Conclusion and next stepsThis post was getting a (tad) too long, so I had to break it down into two halves. In the next post, I\u2019ll publish a intermediary mini-FAQ based on all the questions you sent me to date (and there were a lot, thank you!). This will be later followed by a further blog post analyzing the POS model implemented by the Polkadot relay chain.As usual, you can join the independent, community driven conversation on the Web 3 slack: http://tiny.cc/web3chat, #polkadot channel.I hope this was useful.

The tokenization movement that gained substantial momentum with the proliferation of ethereum takes an important step towards the \u2018Poly-chain future of Web3\u2019.With the release of CoinList, the team at Protocol Labs together with AngelList have launched a KYC-enabled platform for investors to participate in token crowdfunds like the upcoming Filecoin sale, while providing flexibility and defensibility to blockchain projects and their founders. This is massive for a number of reasons:Greater token compliance = greater adoption: By giving accredited investors an easy onboarding platform to participate in the space we open up token crowdfunding to an important and large constituency who would otherwise not deploy capital into projects. This will lead towards greater mass adoption and accelerate corresponding network effects.More clarity for entrepreneurs: We see a number of projects loose considerable time and mind-share worrying over regulatory issues. While it must be very clear that CoinList doesn\u2019t guarantee protection against yet-to-be-drafted laws and/or regulations, CoinList does represent by far the best effort at taking reasonable and necessary steps to try to be compliant. That is a crucial distinction above most of the crowdfunded projects in the ecosystem.Allowing for US investors and entrepreneurs to participate: The United States is the largest economy and by far the largest pool of risk capital on the planet. It is important to have American participation in the blockchain token movement. However, we\u2019ve seen a concerning trend over the last year in the space whereby token crowdfunds were planned to exclude US investors and many US-based teams have been setting up their official addresses in foreign jurisdictions. The fear for the ecosystem is that US regulators could reference such trends to signal a more draconian stance with respect to tokens. I note that it has been an extremely noble and patriotic effort by Protocol Labs to create a solution for tokenized projects and investors right here in the USA so projects can stay here and seek US capital confidently.The Importance of the SAFT (simple agreement for future tokens) model: A lot of us are working on trying to get tokens, token crowdfunding and incentivized blockchain networks compliant. Y Combinator\u2019s SAFE served as the inspiration for the SAFT and there are a few early versions circulating in the market including one we\u2019ve built at Polychain Capital for our own deals. However, Jesse and the team at Protocol Labs have incorporated feedback from all around the ecosystem into their SAFT template which is positioned to become the industry standard. After exhaustive legal analysis, we have all arrived at the conclusion that we just don\u2019t know with certainty how tokens will be treated by regulators over time so it would be best to be prepared for the worst case interpretation. CoinList\u2019s SAFT is designed with this conservative position in mind.Debunking the trolls: The question obviously arises that a centralized platform that filters investors via an accreditation process is somewhat counter to our community\u2019s principals. People have asked me \u201cIf IPFS is all about the decentralization internet and redistribution of power, how can they limit funding participation exclusively to powerful accredited investors?\u201d I refute this myopic argument. We must recognize that early-stage investing is extremely complex and the regulations exist for good reason. Compliance is inherently good and I see it as a necessary part of our ecosystem\u2019s maturation process. However, if you are disappointed because you don\u2019t meet the requirements for accreditation on AngelList, note that there will still be lots of opportunities to support IPFS and many other CoinList projects. Today is just the beginning so be patient, look at the bigger picture because \u2018rising tides lift all ships\u2019 and be thoughtful about your commentary.I am incredibly excited that Polychain Capital will help support many blockchain projects on CoinList. We will be a major capital pool on the platform and we encourage projects that are building compelling blockchain innovations to not fear compliance, KYC or accredited investors and to try out CoinList before making any final crowdfunding decisions. If you are a talented technical team looking to build out applications for IPFS, please reach out. Polychain Capital exists primarily to support and accelerate the decentralized software stack known as Web3.Finally, we must take a moment to express our sincerest gratitude to Juan, Jesse and the incredibly talented team at Protocol Labs. The worst kept secret in crypto currently is that IPFS is the hottest project on the planet. Together with Polkadot and a number of other core infrastructure components, IPFS will be a foundational pillar of Web3. I\u2019m humbled by the opportunity to accompany the nascent moments of this seminal technology that will improve the internet and the world at large in unimaginable ways for many years to come.Note: We will follow-up this post in the coming weeks with a series of essays on optimized token structures, crowdfunding mechanisms as well as some of the trends and lessons learned we have come across in the work we do with many of the top token-enabled blockchain projects in the ecosystem.-Ryan", "responses": 6, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Web3", "Ipfs", "Protocol Tokens", "Crowdfunding"]}, {"title": "Why the Internet Needs to Evolve (Again)", "post_link": "https://medium.com/safenetwork/why-the-internet-needs-to-evolve-again-88b13bd5a58a?source=search_post", "author_name": "MaidSafe", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@maidsafe", "publish_date": "2018-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2018-11-08", "readtime": "5.09", "claps": 2536, "voters": 70, "content": "Why the Internet Needs to Evolve (Again)MaidSafeFollowNov 8, 2018 \u00b7 6 min readToday, the Internet stands for two things in the minds of the masses. To some, the term means a foundational infrastructure, a technology that enables computers to communicate around the globe. But for the majority, the word conjures up something far more amorphous. You only have to ask different people around the world to describe the Internet to see the evidence. For many millions, the entire online experience exists solely inside the Facebook app on their mobile. We all have differing experiences of the world online and descriptions become far more subjective.A Network Of NetworksIn the early days, the Internet was very much defined by its functionality. The world that saw the creation of the ARPANET was one where US government funding drove the construction of a communications network that would scale vast distances. And it was this niche focus that led to a vital innovation in the form of the creation of the TCP/IP packet-switching protocol almost exactly 45 years ago to the day.Relatively few computers were involved by today\u2019s standards. Any concerns that existed were overwhelmingly focused on the drive to build global connectivity \u2014 not security. It was all about connecting \u2018networks of networks\u2019. Global connectivity was the killer app of the so-called internetworking age \u2014 because the sole goal was very specific: to get the internet working.Enter The World Wide Web\u2026It all changed in March 1989 with the publication of Sir Tim Berners-Lee\u2019s proposal to link and share information across the internet in a novel way. With the creation of the World Wide Web, many of the barriers to global involvement fell. But still, the creativity that was unleashed was still contained within specific well-defined boundaries. Innovation remained untapped whilst the evolution to the World Wide Web meant in many cases just an extension to the \u2018broadcast-to-many\u2019 approach to the sharing of information.Technology had stepped out of the shadows in order to lay a number of powerful tools at the feet of society \u2014 emails, early forms of ecommerce and the like. Yet the online landscape remained wild and, for most, uncharted. With the trails hidden from all but the most enthusiastic of early computer hobbyists, the land grab commenced as third parties rushed forward to compete and curate content on behalf of others (for a fee, of course). Suddenly this brave new world had evolved itself into a dead-end as the default online experience became one controlled by the Compuserves and AOLs whose vision was to encircle, protect and monetise.For a brief time, the battle of open versus closed systems raged. But the fundamental flaws of the walled garden approach became clear very quickly. The open and wild internet may have been a scary place \u2014 but from that freedom came the opportunity for real innovation and opportunities for all.Web 2.0, aka The Read/Write/Edit WebConnectivity and access had driven the ubiquity of the Internet as a technology for general use. But there was a huge hole in the picture. Without user-generated content, engagement was low.With the Web 2.0 movement, vast quantities of data was uploaded by individuals in the headlong rush into the read/write/edit web. Now everybody could comment and share their thoughts with a freedom that was unimaginable from the earliest days of the Internet. But as the masses rushed to share their latest news and views across social media platforms and individual blogs, one fatal detail was being overlooked. In the reckless rush online to engage in the pursuit of entertainment and commerce, people freely shared their personal data. Small technology startups, fuelled and fattened by an unlimited torrent of valuable data, exploded in size at a pace previously unheard of, dominating as a result of network effects and their global reach online.This data \u2014 our data \u2014 had become a ridiculously valuable treasure trove of information with a value that accelerated with every passing year. The value was going directly to the companies, rather than individuals. And as the amount of data accelerated, so did the attacks.Connectivity is not SecurityBecause the Web had been designed to be connected \u2014 not secure. With every new day, personal data was being sacrificed at the altar of convenience by millions of people without a thought for the trustworthiness of third parties. Too late, people had started to become conscious that they had not been asking enough questions. It wasn\u2019t only: do you trust each company with your data? But also: do you trust that company to never ever get hacked?It had become abundantly clear. Security online was broken. No company could ever be unhackable. But like the proverbial oil tankers, shipping valuable data instead of oil, these engorged technology company behemoths were by this stage too colossal to turn round.The Next Evolution: DecentralisationBut today, there is a growing acknowledgement that the solution is out there. The evolution of the Decentralised Web, or Web3 movement is hard to miss. Recent advances in peer-to-peer technology have made it possible to demand all three features in our Internet experience for the first time: connectivity, engagement and security. On top of that, the creation of the cryptocurrency movement has provided a framework for financial incentives for individuals to take part in building a new, fairer Web that removes the weaknesses of third parties, in return for direct monetary rewards.Like all paradigm shifts, this new world will neither be easy to build nor its success obvious until we\u2019ve passed the tipping point for mass adoption. Nevertheless, the goals remain very clear.All users must control their own data. At no point must the Internet depend on architectural weak points such as third parties where your data can be stored unencrypted, however temporarily, and attract hackers. And each individual must have the right to choose to use his or her data in apps as they see fit. Data must be transferable and no longer should it be locked up permanently feeding the commercial models of a massive social media advertising platform.It\u2019s a new world. A paradigm shift which requires users to participate \u2014 but also one in which computers that aren\u2019t being fully utilised today can be set to work in a far more efficient and equitable way.Data Wars: A New HopeBack in 1997, people still viewed the World Wide Web as the Wild West. Unkempt, lawless and close-to-impossible for the average user to traverse. In the years that have followed, the openness that seemed so intimidating to many in the early days has proved to be crucial \u2014 the feature, rather than a bug. It\u2019s precisely because of this permissionless architecture that we are now experiencing arguably the greatest acceleration of information and value exchange in the era of modern civilisation. And throughout history, we\u2019ve learned one lesson time and again: free thought and innovative thinking dies when we are forced to rely on central institutions whose sole purpose for existence is to roll out a plan for all our futures \u2014 our interactions, our experiences\u2026in other words, what we are allowed to do.Together we\u2019re moving towards a world in which security must be built in from the lowest level, with all data encrypted by default before it is stored anywhere online. We\u2019re in the early days. But the way in which we communicate around the world needs to change radically.The next age of the Internet is nearly here. As the old saying goes, if you want to start getting involved, the best time to get involved was a couple of years ago. But the second best time is today.We\u2019re looking forward to seeing you there.", "responses": 2, "tags": ["Technology", "Decentralization", "Web3", "Safenetwork"]}, {"title": "Cards at Rest, Cards in Motion", "post_link": "https://medium.com/cardstack/cards-at-rest-cards-in-motion-4a0f88a8b6c5?source=search_post", "author_name": "Chris Tse", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@christse", "publish_date": "2019-01-03", "last_modified_date": "2019-01-18", "readtime": "5.91", "claps": 1193, "voters": 61, "content": "Cards at Rest, Cards in MotionHow cards carry truth around the WebChris TseFollowJan 3 \u00b7 6 min readLast time, we described our vision of a Web 3.0 made up of cards: universal composable experience objects representing content data that can function alone or combine with other objects directly. These cards can can be linked, addressed, referenced, embedded, saved, anywhere.In Cardstack, as you interact with different card-based systems, you\u2019re collecting a library of cards, representing all the things you\u2019ve seen, like a camera roll on a smartphone. This allows you to reuse information and quickly access previous work.But cards aren\u2019t just reference material: they\u2019re powerful building blocks for the Web. We\u2019ve designed cards to be carriers of truth that can assemble with other cards, from multiple participants, to create larger experiences that can be shared and reused. That\u2019s how we get from today\u2019s centralized Web, ruled by overlords, to a Web that reflects the passion of many people working together.Here\u2019s a quick intro to some of the organization and movement principles that create order in the Cardstack Ecosystem.Deck: Gather CardsWhen building a card-based system, like a website or an application, you\u2019ll start by creating a Card Deck. A Deck has a clear owner and in this sense is a \u201clocal\u201d source of truth.You build a Deck by importing data into your instance of Cardstack. As you do so, Cardstack\u2019s Deck data model can suggest content types for your data, and give you templates for cards, or \u201ccard types,\u201d that can represent your content. You can reuse card types, download them, or build your own.This is a breakthrough in the way we think about website composition, combining the power of manual line-by-line coding, with the ease of something like simple drag-and-drop.The first Deck we\u2019ve built is called cardstack/deck, a private GitHub repository soon to be open-sourced. So far we\u2019ve built 27 card types representing what would be the official website for the Cardstack community, and in each one of those 27 cards we have templates and JavaScript JSON:API.Card Space: Arrange CardsA Card Space is the real estate where cards from Decks are arranged. When a card is in a Space, it is \u201cat rest\u201d \u2014 behaving like an embedded widget.A Space can be built from cards in a single Deck, or include cards from multiple Decks, including Decks with different owners. Spaces themselves can be minimized and act as cards. That means you can embed Spaces within Spaces, Spaces within cards, cards within Spaces. The general idea is that a Space is designed to represent a collective truth, built from content owned by one or more participants.Spaces can be public, private or somewhere in between. To use a loose Web 2.0 analogy, if the Facebook web app is the \u201cDeck,\u201d then a Facebook profile, or the News Feed, would be examples of \u201cSpaces\u201d: where contributions from multiple parties come together to form a shared understanding.Cardstack represents an evolution from Web 2.0 because cards are not tied to their Spaces, and Spaces do not change the ownership of cards. Cards that exist in Spaces can simultaneously exist in other Spaces \u2014 and still belong to their Decks and their owners. This is why we refer to cards as carriers of truth: their original integrity and ownership is not compromised as they move through the Web and perform different roles within different spaces.Card Flow: Move CardsHow do cards get from one place to another?If a card is \u201cin motion,\u201d for example, being submitted for review or getting shared with others, it enters what we call Card Flow: a state of moving in and out of Decks and Spaces. The Cardstack Framework comes with out-of-the-box tools to conduct Card Flow in a way that\u2019ll be familiar to anyone who has used a messenger app, or a workplace collaboration tool like Slack.If a card exists in your library, or in a Deck or a Space you control, you can use Card Flow to submit it for review, place it in another Space, share it with a friend, and so on.Card Flow is powered by Git. This is hidden from the user: the goal of Card Flow UI is to make collaboration as easy and accessible as possible. But beneath the surface, you are merging, proposing and committing changes using a powerful distributed version control system developers use every day. In short: making open-source contributions.4 Edges: Edit CardsYour Card Deck, Card Space, and Card Flow let you generate, arrange and move cards. Now, let\u2019s say you want to edit cards directly.4 Edges gives you card editing tools, with panels you can pull in or retract from the perimeter of the card, similar to Adobe Photoshop.Each edge provides a different capability: on your left edge you have all your different networks that are feeding in information; on the right you have your configuration panel, where you can tweak every element of the card; on the bottom you have your libraries; and on the top you have environments (where are you going to publish your work, etc.)All 4 Edges are shared across all card-based applications, so that once you learn how to use the properties panel for one type of card, it\u2019s the same whether you\u2019re configuring a piece of content, a data source or configuring your wallet.Card Physics in ActionIf a card is an individual carrier of truth, then Deck, Space, Flow, and 4 Edges are states of organization and customization that work together to create a universe where cards can assemble into shared understandings. Our design system\u2019s composability allows these understandings to be take on just about any form.We are currently developing the next use case of the Cardstack Framework: a media registry that uses 4 Edges principles combined with Card Space, Card Flow to build a blockchain-backed platform that gives publishers, industry professionals, and artists a way to collaborate on metadata and come to consensus on ownership rights.Card Space allows users to switch between local and collective views of song files, metadata, user profiles, agreements, and so on. Card Flow enables version-controlled collaboration: an artist\u2019s manager submits a license, changes are suggested by lawyers, the final contract is approved or rejected by the label, before payment is fairly allocated to contributors.These same principles can be used in a variety of use cases. For example:Decentralized organizations \u2014 First-gen decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) are theoretically interesting, but are hardly usable for day-to-day work. Cardstack\u2019s design system maps to the underlying concepts of DAOs: letting you use Decks, Spaces, and Flow to assemble content and value shared by multiple parties into an interaction space that does not belong just to one individual.Collaborative community editing \u2014Imagine an emergent syndication network where content creators retain ownership and value can be shared via on-chain attribution. In this case, content creators could author drafts in a private Card Deck, and submit them using Card Flow. Inside Flow, multiple users could edit, collaborate and chat, before publishing content to a public Space. Content still lives in creators\u2019 Decks as it gets viewed, syndicated and embedded to new Spaces. If both ownership and distribution is verified on-chain, then rewards can be automatically distributed to the creators.Trading non-fungible tokens\u2014CryptoKitties was just the beginning. Tokenized assets and NFTs have the potential to transform the way we exchange value and information, and Card UI maps precisely to what users need to organize, use, and trade their assets while maintaining clarity around ownership. Card-based design enables experiences to be built around NFTs: from something as simple as a gallery to show off your collectibles, to networks where NFTs have utility.I\u2019ll expand on these ideas in an upcoming article \u2014 and talk about where we are in developing the Framework.Learn MoreFrom Speculation to Utility by Chris TseGrowing a Healthy Software Ecosystem by Lead Developer Ed FaulknerHow the Cardstack Framework Powers Decentralized ApplicationsThe Cardstack White Paperhttps://cardstack.com/Chris Tse (@christse) is a technologist and designer.

But before diving headfirst into all of the hugely exciting things that 2019 promises, it\u2019s a great time to reflect on what the last year delivered for the SAFE Network. As the MaidSafe team continues to grow and the releases continue to stack up on GitHub, it\u2019s easy to lose track of just how much progress has been made, both by MaidSafe and the wider community.So if you\u2019re new to the SAFE Network, first off \u2014 welcome! Hopefully this will give you a place to start from when taking a deeper look into the progress that has been made.The SAFE Network FundamentalsWe worked this year on distilling a number of essential truths about the SAFE Network into a list of twenty one Fundamentals. You can read these on the website but if you\u2019re looking for a little more context about why each of these has consistently guided the design of the Network for the last twelve years or so, it\u2019s worth checking out the post on the Forum that explains the context.PARSECUp there with the biggest news of the year was the release of the Protocol for Asynchronous Reliable Secure and Efficient Consensus (PARSEC). In May 2018, MaidSafe announced the release of PARSEC, a new completely decentralised, open source, highly asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus mechanism. In other words, it\u2019s the method by which a global network can come to agreement on what happened, and when, without requiring any centralised authority.Much of the rest of the year for the Routing team has been focused on integrating this into the SAFE Network and we\u2019re hoping that many other projects take up the tech and use it for their own purposes. You can read more about it in the White Paper, the release of the code, a number of podcasts, technical and not-so-technical videos, a TechCrunch article and many other places!CrustThere was plenty of excitement amongst the community when we released a couple of tests to see how our peer-to-peer networking library Crust (Connections in Rust) would fare in the wild. Between both the first Crust test and the second, we saw some fantastic results. So after involvement from 37 countries and over 20,000 attempted connections, with connections into and out of China also very strong (88% success rate overall), we\u2019re happy to say that people are able to connect to each other directly! We also found some interesting evidence of issues out there that support our fundamental stance that all data on the new decentralised Internet needs to be encrypted.SAFE and SolidGreat progress was made in 2018 between Sir Tim Berners-Lee\u2019s SOLID project and the SAFE Network. By building the framework to ensure that data is saved on the SAFE Network in a way that is compatible with Solid\u2019s semantic web approach, we\u2019re able to ensure that our shared visions of total user control of data and excision of the third party aggregators who currently control and use our data in ways that we don\u2019t intend are able to fit snugly together.We released a Proof of Concept to highlight this in July 2018 called Patter. A Twitter-esque proof-of-concept, you can check out the details here (Josh\u2019s blog post and this podcast). What\u2019s more, the new SAFE Browser has support for RDF data structures!VideosWe released a range of video content this year \u2014 from explaining the difference between the SAFE Network and blockchain-based storage, to a couple of videos funded by the Community Engagement Programme (talking about the currency of the SAFE Network and the Proof Of Resource mechanism).CommunityThe Community really took strides forward this year with regular meetups in London, Chicago and Brighton. Community member @fergish continued to forge ahead with his SAFE Crossroads Podcast. And it was fantastic to see the SAFE Network Primer being produced in January by the community, giving newcomers a straightforward document to take a look through when they first explore the project.The team were also out and about talking at a variety of conferences events, including FOSDEM, MozFest, RustFest Paris, RustFest Rome and RustRush amongst others. And we held the first ever SAFE DevCon in April 2018. It was an amazing day with the entire MaidSafe team in attendance and a huge number of well-known community members meeting each other face-to-face for the first time ever. You can watch the videos from the day here \u2014 and news of SAFE DevCon 2019 will follow soon\u2026New WebsitesThere are now three key websites: we released safenetwork.tech (for newcomers, privacy advocates, journalists), SAFE DevHub (for developers and more technical types) and then we\u2019ve reduced the prominence of maidsafe.net to reflect the primacy of the Network and community over MaidSafe as an organisation. That brings it more in line with the ethos of the project, whereby the Community run the forum and a number of the social channels such as Telegram and Reddit.Publicity and News StoriesIt was an exciting year for news stories. First, we were able to talk about the fact that David, Viv and Nick had been acting as advisors to HBO\u2019s hugely popular \u2018Silicon Valley\u2019 show. And Hollywood continued to sniff around the Network with the appearance of the SAFE Network in unexpected places \u2014 not least \u2018Wreck-It Ralph 2: Ralph Breaks The Internet\u2019.All of this came on top of the fact that the world is increasingly looking into the decentralisation of the Internet to solve some existing problems. In a year of trials and tribulations for Facebook, Google and others, MaidSafe and the SAFE Network were profiled in a piece in The Guardian newspaper whilst we also sponsored the Decentralized Web Summit in San Francisco (somewhat ironically\u2026) in 2018. We also introduced more ways than ever to follow the project \u2014 including the new Email Mailing List and watching MAID via various coin apps (Blockfolio, BitUniverse, Delta Direct, CoinGecko).MaidSafe Team GrowthThe MaidSafe team has continued to grow over the past twelve months, not least with the opening of a new office in Chennai, India. We\u2019ve had 12 new starts around the world in the past year, a growth of 26% in the total headcount. Most have introduced themselves here in case you\u2019d like to get to know the team a little better (you\u2019ll find them on the safenetwork Medium publication).Community AppsWe saw some strong growth in app development from the community during 2018 \u2014 from the JAMS! music project, to SAFE Drive, Project Decorum, SAFE-CMS, SAFE-Search and SAFE CLI Boilerplate amongst many others. Particularly given the Android release this year, we\u2019re looking forward to seeing this area really grow in the future.So: What\u2019s Next?2018 saw huge steps forward for the SAFE Browser (including the most recent v0.11.0 release), Web Hosting Manager, the rebooting of the RFC process (such as suggestions for XOR URL\u2019s on the Network) and far too many other areas to mention.And 2019 is shaping up to provide even more excitement.We\u2019re moving on towards the release of SAFE Fleming: that means PARSEC fully integrated into the Routing layer, with Dynamic Membership, malice detection, our sharding solution (Disjoint Sections) and Secure Message Relay all working as we enable everything to run decentralised routing nodes from home. Work will continue on embedding RDF support within SAFE whilst we start to really focus on bringing UX principles into a more foundational level within the software \u2014 together with a whole raft of other new and exciting improvements!In the meantime, we\u2019ll continue to be out there, spreading the word and working to collaborate with anyone who\u2019s interested and shares our vision of a fully-decentralised Internet with security, privacy and freedom for all.So whether you\u2019ve been involved in running tests, submitting code, finding bugs, chatting on the forum, running meetups, giving talks, sharing the progress of the SAFE Network across social media, we\u2019d just like to say thanks for all your support in 2018.Roll on 2019!", "responses": 1, "tags": ["Decentralization", "Web3", "Privacy", "Solid", "Announcements"]}, {"title": "The Road To SAFE-Fleming (Part 2): Dynamic Membership", "post_link": "https://medium.com/safenetwork/the-road-to-safe-fleming-part-2-dynamic-membership-ab552ef15193?source=search_post", "author_name": "MaidSafe", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@maidsafe", "publish_date": "2018-12-12", "last_modified_date": "2018-12-13", "readtime": "4.23", "claps": 2171, "voters": 55, "content": "The Road To SAFE-Fleming (Part 2): Dynamic MembershipMaidSafeFollowDec 12, 2018 \u00b7 5 min readPhoto by Benny Jackson on UnsplashAs we move towards the release of SAFE-Fleming (Alpha 3), we\u2019re starting to release the jigsaw pieces to create a new decentralised peer-to-peer routing network \u2014 the brain of the new decentralised internet. And with people around the world forming thousands of peer-to-peer connections in the recent Crust test, it\u2019s now time to move to the next stage.What\u2019s Dynamic Membership? And What\u2019s it Got To Do with PARSEC?When we released the White Paper for PARSEC, our ground-breaking ABFT consensus algorithm back in May 2018, we were driven by certain design principles. First, any consensus mechanism had to be scalable in order to support a vast amount of data travelling across a global network. It is also mathematically proven to always reach consensus even under the worst theoretical byzantine threats that any ABFT algorithm can sustain.Since then, we\u2019ve been building PARSEC into the brain of the Network. Known as the Routing layer, it\u2019s where the decisions get made. And in a big part of this work was devoted to tackling one question in particular: getting PARSEC working in a dynamic, as opposed to a static, Network.Static v Dynamic. Permissioned v PermissionlessLet\u2019s unpack that for a moment. What\u2019s the difference between a static and dynamic network?A static network just means that the Network is made up of nodes that don\u2019t change. Perhaps they\u2019re members of the same organisation. Or different companies who are joining together to share the benefits in some way. Regardless of the reason, a decision has usually been made to restrict membership and the system is designed and optimised only for those nodes that have made the cut.This is very different to the dynamic membership \u2014 something that you get with the SAFE Network where one of the guiding fundamentals is to be open and permissionless. Anyone around the world must be able to contribute their computing resources and join the Network. In other words, nodes can join and leave at will.No gatekeepers.But with a decentralised network, that presents a number of challenges. What\u2019s stopping an attacker spinning up thousands of nodes to attack the Network (known as a Sybil attack)? What if low-quality nodes that don\u2019t meet the basic requirements join and damage the Network functionality? These, together with other concepts (such as Disjoint Sections, encryption, churn and Secure Message Relay) have all been discussed before and we\u2019ll also be highlighting these in more depth in future posts.But for the purpose of this article, we\u2019re just going to focus on one: Dynamic Membership. Because it\u2019s a crucial question: with the doors open, how do nodes reach agreement on what happened, and in what order, whilst nodes are joining and leaving at will? And how can a new node possibly find out what\u2019s been agreed in the past in a secure and verifiably correct way?Listen Carefully \u2014 To Those Who Can Prove They\u2019re Telling The TruthSo each node is listening intently to see what\u2019s happening across the Network. But because of the vast size of the Network, messages inevitably arrive at different nodes around the world in different orders. And that\u2019s what you need PARSEC for \u2014 to guarantee that every message shared on the Network is recorded \u2014 and in the same order \u2014 by every other node.Check out the following video to learn more about how PARSEC works with Dynamic Membership \u2014 in other words, nodes joining and leaving the Network at will. It shows an example which you can run for yourself (head along to https://github.com/maidsafe/parsec) in order to see graphs that illustrate the process for you. The example shows exactly what happens as each round of gossip is generated and how different nodes then take this information to arrive at the same sequence of stable blocks \u2014 despite the fact that nodes are constantly being added and removed.TL;DR it doesn\u2019t matter if the membership of the Network is constantly changing. The SAFE Network will still reach consensus.Dynamic Membership and Consensus \u2014 How PARSEC Fits Into the PictureSo what happens when a node has poor connectivity or the other nodes realise that it\u2019s malicious and attempting to attack the Network? The nodes all vote using PARSEC. And if consensus is reached, they remove the Node from their list of peers, forcing the node to leave. It\u2019s a pariah. No honest node will accept any of its messages. It has no option but to disconnect.PARSEC and Joining the NetworkPARSEC is also used by any node that wants to join the Network. A node following PARSEC notifies others that there\u2019s a new node who wants to join. Voting time once again \u2014 and, when the existing nodes reach consensus, the new node joins.But how does the new node catch up with what\u2019s been happening? Where does it go to learn the existing history of the Network?This is the really interesting bit. After being voted in, the new nodes get sent the whole gossip graph of the Network at that point in time. So the newcomer can now trace the history of consensus on the Network all the way from its genesis to the present day. It can use this to derive a provably correct list of current members by replaying every single membership change that\u2019s taken place since the start of that Section of the Network.And now the graph\u2019s updated \u2014 to show that the new Node has joined the Network and is a full member.ConclusionIf you\u2019re building permissionless networks, this is a well-known challenge. When you can\u2019t use something like a proof-of-work blockchain (because the restrictions of throughput and encryption restrictions in blockchain tech don\u2019t scale for a project like ours), the answer isn\u2019t straightforward. But now hopefully you can see how the SAFE Network provides a solution.Of course, this is a part of the puzzle \u2014 not the final solution. But with each passing day, we\u2019re getting closer to that all-important SAFE-Fleming release. Next up, we\u2019ll be diving into Malice Detection and Secure Message Relay, amongst many other concepts \u2014 but we\u2019ll leave that for another day\u2026If you\u2019ve got any questions, just give us a shout \u2014 either in the comments below, on the Forum or on any of the usual social media channels.As ever, thanks for reading!", "responses": 2, "tags": ["Decentralization", "Web3"]}, {"title": "ConsenSys: A Decentralized Organization Building Decentralized Technology", "post_link": "https://media.consensys.net/consensys-a-decentralized-organization-building-decentralized-technology-df235461119a?source=search_post", "author_name": "ConsenSys", "author_link": "https://media.consensys.net/@ConsenSys", "publish_date": "2018-11-09", "last_modified_date": "2018-11-10", "readtime": "5.49", "claps": 528, "voters": 54, "content": "ConsenSys: A Decentralized Organization Building Decentralized TechnologyHow does the decentralization of technology influence the structure of a company\u2019s internal organization?ConsenSysFollowNov 9, 2018 \u00b7 6 min readAs technologies advance and an increasing number of millennials dominate the workplace, we are seeing an exponential growth of businesses moving away from traditional company structures. Many new companies are gravitating towards innovative work environments that foster flexibility, trust, and transparency. ConsenSys is a blockchain venture production studio with global efforts in economic, social, and political sectors. The company has implemented a non-traditional business structure, a decentralized organizational system which places a high level of trust for its employees to manage themselves.In a decentralized organization, there is no hierarchical management team that makes most decisions on behalf of others. Each individual has the authority to make their own decisions, with an eye to adding value to their team or to ConsenSys as a whole. A decentralized organization and the self-management way of working resonate symbiotically. Self-organization is a process where order emerges when individuals and teams interact within an unstructured system. Under fluctuations and feedback, order establishes based on the actions and interactions between team members. With teams establishing their own order and decision making strategies, this results in an organization that is decentralized. Since this process allows teams to constantly reorganize themselves based on what works best for them, the whole organization itself is able to survive and repair in times of chaos and unpredictability.The failings of a traditional hierarchical system hit us right in the \u2018gut,\u2019 at a human and soul level.ConsenSys\u2019 unique organizational structure is built on trust and is heavily inspired by the components of a blockchain. In a discussion with Russell Verbeeten, he emphasized that ConsenSys is comprised of a network of interdependent teams cooperating while simultaneously pursuing their own goals. This structure mimics the communication structure of the decentralized systems ConsenSys builds together with the larger Ethereum ecosystem. ConsenSys embraces Conway\u2019s law, which suggests that organizational structures should mirror the architectures of the technology they are building.By mirroring the communication structure of the technology, ConsenSys has recognized a higher level of flexibility, openness, and innovation. Verbeteen shared that, \u201cBlockchain powers innovation because the infrastructure developed on platforms like Ethereum brings online open systems that are available for developers, entrepreneurs, and companies, ready to repurpose for their own needs.\u201d Innovation is vital. ConsenSys is organized the way it is because they need to optimize for innovation upon this emerging technology.The failings of a traditional hierarchical system hit us right in the \u2018gut,\u2019 at a human and soul level. We sometimes have just an inkling that the system doesn\u2019t fit us; other times it just feels downright oppressive. I believe globally we are starting to feel the effects of the current system quite emotionally. The centralized power structure in a traditional hierarchy has the power to unilaterally block great ideas and destroy productive innovations and consequently the human spirit. Alternatively, self-organizing and self-governing systems give opportunity for individuals to contribute ideas and watch them come to life with the support of a community. Web3 and decentralized organizational structures have the potential to unleash people who are creative and create space for everyone to bring their unique skills and passions to a collaborative value creation process. This is an emerging alternative paradigm for human organizations that I feel the world has long been waiting for.Bryan PetersPeters mentioned several great points above. At ConsenSys, the decentralized system allows employees to work transparently and encourages innovation, but it also impacts employees on an emotional level. Companies are starting to adopt non-traditional structures and new strategies to better support and motivate employees. In a healthy self-organizing team, creativity is embraced openly, employees have a direct input and connection to the company\u2019s growth, and they have the freedom to utilize their knowledge to implement their own ideas. With blockchain technology being highly innovative and moldable for improvement, an organizational structure that supports a culture of innovation is essential to success.The recent innovation of a rather simple data structure, the blockchain, is novel in human history and makes entirely new ways of coordinating social activities possible.Blockchain redefines trust between entities and is revolutionary in the way individuals, businesses, and governments work together. Here are a few key thoughts gathered on Web3\u2019s impact in our existing ecosystem:Web3 is about controlling your own information and being able to relinquish the powers from a central party or monopoly. It is about empowerment of the people and providing choice and censorship-resistant platforms that enable us to become equals. The ability to remove the need to rely on trust is critical to its success. You will likely see a higher adoption of Web3 technologies by people that currently can\u2019t trust their governments (i.e. third world countries) to do what is best in the interest of their country.Kevin ZhangWeb3, unlike the internet today, places trust at the infrastructure level. The emergence of Web3 and blockchain is now providing a trustful foundation for us to build on as a global community and try new things. A protocol that creates the opportunity to improve human sharing and collaboration. Anything too rigid constrains the innovation cycle. Web3 requires us to constantly have new ideas and the more rigid we are, the less relevant we will become in this rapidly evolving Web3 world. In the past, we\u2019ve never had a technology that can support some of the hypothetical social and economic improvements scholars hypothesized and so many of these great ideas didn\u2019t get implemented. I\u2019m watching the conversation shift from \u201cBlockchain can\u2019t do this or that,\u201d to, \u201cHow fast can blockchain scale up to help us achieve this?\u201dBryan PetersBoth Zhang and Peters alluded to the fact that the impact of Web3 on our existing ecosystem can be enormous. Wherever we have transactions that involve trust, Web3 may have the potential to intervene. Instead of being limited by what we have before us, we now have a foundation we can build on to achieve what we have not reached before. As more minds come together to collaborate and innovate, the full potential of Web3 is unimaginable.Now, you may be wondering why the average modern community should care about Web3 or the decentralized organizational structure that ConsenSys offers. Kirk Dameron shared that \u201cthe recent innovation of a rather simple data structure, the blockchain, is novel in human history and makes entirely new ways of coordinating social activities possible.\u201dWe believe there is a strong sense in which these organizational strategies extend beyond the technological needs as put forward by Conway. As the rate of change accelerates in society, decentralized organizational strategies both help build the technology of decentralization and are themselves enabled by the technology. As our own internal infrastructure matures, ConsenSys believes that other organizations needing to move themselves away from traditional hierarchies will be able to benefit from the tools we are building. Our mission is surely to build software for ourselves and others that can help the world adapt to the new economic realities of the 21st century.Russell VerbeteenConsenSys believes in Web3 and the decentralized organizational structure. Though this new paradigm is still in the infancy phase, ConsenSys\u2019 largely decentralized structure has accelerated the emergence of many new and exciting experiments. More importantly, as highlighted above by Verbeteen, ConsenSys has built tools and processes to help them manage themselves in a decentralized way. Other organizations moving towards a decentralized system can benefit from these tools that ConsenSys has built and continues to build. Effective tools and strategies are to be shared. Change is accelerating quicker than it ever has, and ConsenSys is building tools to equip others to better prepare for the future.To stay connected with ConsenSys Canada, subscribe to our monthly ConsenSys Canada newsletter here and receive news on local updates, event details, hiring and more!

It stands for Connections in Rust, a low-level networking library that is optimised for P2P connections between nodes. In other words, it\u2019s the way that computers connect to each other whilst building a decentralised Network.After a couple of public tests, we wanted to say thanks to everyone who took part \u2014 whether in the initial test on October 11th or the more extensive test that we released a couple of weeks later.Read on to learn more about why this test was valuable, and what the next steps are.tl;dr we got the results we were hoping for! :)Summary of ResultsFrom the start, the level of engagement around the world was humbling. We saw over 20,000 attempted connections during the tests, with computers from 37 countries taking part, including:-Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, China, Croatia, Czechia, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Malta, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Republic of Korea, Republic of Lithuania, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Turkey, Ukraine, United Kingdom, United States.Screenshot of part of the v2 Crust Test DashboardIn the first test, we focused on testing the effectiveness of UDP and TCP hole punching by itself. To put it another way: if computers aren\u2019t able to speak directly to each other, how good is the software at punching through the barriers that make each one invisible to the other (for example, where a computer has no public IP address as it lives behind a home router). The answer? We saw successful connections punched through (using UDP and/or TCP hole punching) around 48% of the time.A couple of weeks later, we released a test with a significantly more effective version of Crust. The software now also enabled nodes to connect directly (in addition to using TCP and UDP hole punching), whilst we also enhanced the dashboard performance and filtering options that helped illustrate what was going on.And the results second time round? Even more compelling: with 11,584 attempted connections, we saw a 75% success rate now that nodes had this extra option of directly connecting to other computers around the world.What Goals Did We Have at the Start of the Test?As the foundational communication method within the SAFE Network at launch, we\u2019ve been working on Crust for a number of years. The goal of the Crust Tests was therefore pretty simple: deliver this milestone in order to confirm that the technology is working as designed in the wild. Furthermore, as a standalone library that\u2019s free to be picked up for use by other projects, it was important to stress-test the capabilities at this point in time on the road to the next major inflection point \u2014 the release of SAFE-Fleming.After all, the SAFE Network isn\u2019t simply some kind of VPN-\u2019replacement\u2019 internet\u2026What Else Did We Find Out?With the SAFE Network, every single piece of user-submitted data must be encrypted before it hits the Network. The SAFE Network Fundamentals require full encryption and we saw very clear evidence of why this is required in the first test. You can read more about the issues that we saw in this post \u2014 but to quote that post:\u201cIf an ISP can change your IP address, what else is it doing to your data behind the scenes? Encryption prevents this. That\u2019s exactly why we\u2019ve built the Crust library with this principle in mind. It\u2019s all very well creating a software library that facilitates peer-to-peer communication. But if (as many high-profile projects are doing today) you\u2019re not encrypting every single piece of user data as it hits the wire? You\u2019re little more than a Band-Aid that falls off as soon as the weather turns. And you\u2019re no longer solving the very real problems out there.\u201dAgain, this isn\u2019t about getting something out there into the wild and letting it fend for itself. It\u2019s about providing effective tools that ensure the privacy and security of SAFE users above all else. And there\u2019s a world of difference between the two.What Do We Still Need to Do with Crust?Future work within Crust will focus on:expanding the ways in which Crust can communicate (the addition of multi-protocol support);the release of a more decentralised method by which a new node can dynamically join the Network (Bootstrap Cache); andwork to ensure that all data is transported in an encrypted format as it traverses the Network (Secure Serialisation).What Do We Still Need to Do for SAFE-Fleming?With the work that\u2019s been carried out to date, we now have all the information that we need on Crust in order to get us to SAFE-Fleming.The Fleming Release is a major milestone for the SAFE Network. At that stage, we\u2019ll be releasing a truly decentralised global routing network for transient data. We now have the evidence that Crust is working as planned. In fact, the tech that we\u2019ve been testing in this test is more advanced than the version of Crust that is required for Fleming. SAFE-Fleming itself only requires Crust to provide the ability for computers to connect via direct connections or through what is known as UPnP connections (where an individual carries out manual port-forwarding using his or her router in order to connect to the Network). Once Fleming is out in the wild and in daily use, we\u2019ll be moving on to including the ability for Crust to function using hole-punching also.The next few weeks will see the release of many of the remaining constituent parts of the Routing layer (aka \u2018the brains\u2019) of the SAFE Network: dynamic membership, malice detection and sharding amongst other things. Expect to hear much more about each of these as we release them in stages! But in the meantime, thanks to everyone who took part in the Crust Tests.

a Permissionless NetworkMaidSafeFollowAug 7 \u00b7 4 min readPhoto by Franck V. on UnsplashLook up permission in the dictionary and you\u2019ll find that it comes from the Latin word \u2018permissio\u2019. It means granting someone the liberty to do something. In other words, someone has agreed that you can act as you wish. That might be a boss, a leader, a ruler \u2014 whatever. But how is permission relevant when it comes to the Internet?The Web today is very differentThe early days of the Internet were permissionless. When Tim Berners-Lee began building the World Wide Web, he didn\u2019t ask permission. He just did it. And the doors of the Internet remained wide open \u2014 unless you chose to hide behind the walled gardens of AOL or Compuserve. By simply writing the code that would make your ideas tangible, there were no limits to innovation. Anyone, anywhere around the world, could throw up a website based simply on an idea.But today, it\u2019s far from straightforward. As the years passed, many avoided the hard work of learning to code by simply signing up for \u2018free\u2019 services created by others. For example, Gmail was launched over 15 years ago. But is the world now changing?How many people would have moved to Gmail if they\u2019d been fully aware that in doing so they permitting a large company to access their emails to improve their commercial advertising model?Coding brings superpowers\u2026.and responsibilitiesSoftware is a superpower. The advent of coding brought very different characteristics to the standard products that came before the computer age. Code scales immensely quickly and for very little cost. That brings with it implications. First, it\u2019s essential that the more foundational the software is to others, the more important it is that such code is \u2018locked open\u2019 and freely accessible. Partly to allow simpler maintenance and auditing. But also to minimise the inequalities that are inevitable if a small group of individuals gain control of the floor upon which everyone else builds.And second, people need freedom to build on top of base levels because the world is a vast and diverse place. The belief that technology that will service every niche of global society can be designed and implemented by one particular company, social class or even geographic background who all share a specific world view is not only arrogant, but dangerous.Society advances by experimentationFreedom is a broad concept. It means many things to different people. But one thing that\u2019s very clear (albeit slightly counterintuitive) is because with freedom, people make mistakes. Building a world in which people are scared to fail is dangerous \u2014 because successful innovation is as much about the many failed attempts as the few that are successful. Society advances by experimentation. So whilst the permissionless landscape may appear at times to be wild and chaotic, with many failures, the general direction of travel is clear: defend the freedom to innovate, the likely range of beneficial outcomes grows significantly.Yet where are we today?Over the past decade or so, we\u2019ve all watched the companies that own the ramps that lead on and off networks accrue unheard-of wealth and power. And with the growth in importance of such platforms, these gatekeepers set the rules for everyone else. Rules that are often governed by commercial targets that conflict with most people\u2019s visions of a fair and peaceful society. When dealing with vast quantities of users\u2019 personal data in the digital world, you can pretty much guarantee that such rules will translate \u2014 at the very least \u2014 to an attack on your privacy.We don\u2019t think that this can ever be the way forward.Permissionless innovation and software development is crucialAt MaidSafe, we\u2019re building a permissionless network. So what does that mean?We believe developers should be able to pick up their tools and build, and content developers should be able to publish their work, without asking permission of network gatekeepers.We believe that the best innovation comes from allowing anyone to contribute.And we don\u2019t believe in the opportunities for progress being restricted only to a credentialled minority of the global population. Anyone should have the potential to build upon the discoveries of those who came before them in the pursuit of knowledge that may benefit others in the world.So let\u2019s remove the barriers. Let\u2019s build networks that are open, as far as possible. Give people around the world the opportunity to build, to innovate \u2014 and yes, to fail \u2014 but also, crucially, to succeed. The principles of open source software are the building blocks for permissionless innovation. The SAFE Network is a permissionless infrastructure that lets anyone who believes in Privacy, Security and Freedom create a future in which these individual rights can no longer be ignored.With SAFE, there are no gatekeepers. No permission that needs to be asked for \u2014 and none required. Because we believe that only by taking this approach do we as a society have a real chance of solving the many problems that we face.

When users receive these fungible tokens, they tend to seek liquidity and economic profit rather than signal their contributions. Rather than being a cryptonetwork. Open Proofs is a common resource standard \u2014 smart contract \u2014 that is completely free and open source.Non-fungible tokens in the form are badges are used to signal unique contributions. They are unique because they have a unique `tokenID` and metadata associated with it. Badges are a way to signal proof done by a private key in a verifiable, trustless way to third-parties.Why Badges?Badges are a step towards verifiable & scarce on-chain achievements. Badges will indicate what a user has done rather than what the user currently owns. Separating badges from tokens is an important step in the process. Communities might want to use proof for an in-application achievement system, reward open-source developer contributions, or even provide access keys to certain digital content.Why Proofs?Currently, Dapps are not being adopted outside of the crypto community. We believe that current UI/UX flows are too complex for the average user. Dapps usually force you to install Metamask, buy ETH and worry about your private keys. We believe this flow \u2014 along with scalability \u2014 is preventing mass adoption.The cold and harsh truth is that users don\u2019t care about decentralization. Users want a simple and recognizable login-functionality with the ability to port over existing data, similar to Facebook Login. Right now, we can\u2019t move data or items outside of traditional web applications. Tokens and NFTs that are registered on a public blockchain are both verifiable and owned by the user. They are not tied to any specific platform. Blockchain enables an individual to prove that they contributed to a specific network at any point in time, which allows them to be rewarded with future tokens or digital goods.Here are some use cases we foresee by creating an identity layer with non-transferable badges:Airdrop targeting- Distribution for tokens is currently flawed. Speculators are not users. We can better target users by proving they\u2019ve contributed to a network or acquired a token at some point in time.Digital Access \u2014 Users will be able to access certain dApps as long as they\u2019ve obtained a specific badge on a different platform. Users can mint new digital assets only if they\u2019ve obtained a specific badge. Users can then loan their digital goods to users with badges to complete certain tasks.Patronage \u2014 Donating to a specific address or influencer would reward you with a badge indicating your support for the particular influencer.Achievements \u2014 If you\u2019re a bit of a showoff, now you can become an achievement hunter with proof badges.The TechInspired by projects like MetaTx and Universal Logins, Open Proofs is designed so any project can craft digitally scarce badges without the need to install MetaMask, buy ETH, and deploy smart contracts. Creators will just need to pay enough to cover gas costs. Open Proofs will use meta-txs so users retain custody of the badge up the entire time throughout the minting process.If you\u2019re interested in learning more about Open Proofs, you can check out our GitHub repo or sign up for early access here.Proofs is built by @ramonrecuero (ramonrecuero.com), Brian Flynn (brianflynn.me) & Adam Breckler (Prism.IO)", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Cryptocurrency", "Web3", "Badges", "Ethereum"]}, {"title": "How We Support Native Android Development on SAFE", "post_link": "https://medium.com/safenetwork/how-we-support-native-android-development-on-safe-706d477f3509?source=search_post", "author_name": "MaidSafe", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@maidsafe", "publish_date": "2019-01-16", "last_modified_date": "2019-01-17", "readtime": "2.09", "claps": 1471, "voters": 35, "content": "How We Support Native Android Development on SAFEMaidSafeFollowJan 16 \u00b7 3 min readPhoto by Edho Pratama on UnsplashLast week we announced support for SAFE development on the Android platform with the release of a new Java API, updated mobile SAFE Authenticator and an Android App tutorial. You\u2019ll find more detailed information on the forum post here.Today we\u2019re releasing a video run-through by one of the team, Lionel Faber, to give you a better feel for what you can do. Lionel was also interviewed on the most recent edition of the SAFE Crossroads Podcast.The video shows how to build native Android applications for the SAFE Network using Java. You can do this by working locally initially on a \u2018mock network\u2019 in order to develop and test your new app. Once you\u2019re happy, then it\u2019s straightforward to migrate this to the live Alpha-2 Network.Self-authentication is a crucial part of the SAFE Network. It\u2019s the way individuals connect to the Network without requiring the permission of any third party. This is where the updated mobile SAFE Authenticator comes in \u2014 because if you\u2019re building a SAFE app (or decentralised application) you\u2019re going to need a way for the user to authorise your DApp in the first place.There are two types of data on the SAFE Network \u2014 Immutable Data (where the data\u2019s hash is used as its storage address) and Mutable Data (where data can be either public or private and also modified by an owner \u2014 which gives a user the ability to choose which DApps can access which data). In other words, the individual remains as always in control of his or her data. By running the tutorial, you\u2019ll be able to see basic Mutable Data operations being carried out.The release also uses product flavours to switch between mock and non-mock versions of the Application. In addition it has been built to enable the DApp\u2019s own container to be used (meaning that the DApp remembers where to find the encrypted, stored information about the data (Name, type-tag etc) each time it\u2019s launched).It\u2019s a big step forwards. This gives mobile Android Developers the tools to build the next generation of decentralised applications on the SAFE Network. That should appeal to anyone who\u2019s focused on ensuring privacy, security and freedom for a global network of users. It\u2019s an opportunity to build mobile applications whilst avoiding the pain of server setup and leaving behind the usual worries about securing users\u2019 sensitive personal data yourself. And, once the Network\u2019s currency is released, SAFE apps will provide a built-in revenue stream for developers, paid to them by the Network based on the popularity of their application.So if the thought of building decentralised applications on the world\u2019s first autonomous, permissionless and censorship-resistant network is something you want to learn more about, hopefully you\u2019ve got the detail to get started. But if you do have any questions, please jump into the Forum thread and the Community will be keen to give you a hand!", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Decentralization", "Web3", "Android", "Dapps", "Updates"]}, {"title": "GoChain Turns One, Rebrands with an Increased Focus on Enterprise Adoption", "post_link": "https://medium.com/gochain/gochain-turns-one-rebrands-with-an-increased-focus-on-enterprise-adoption-c84bb24ccb03?source=search_post", "author_name": "GoChainGo", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@gochaingo", "publish_date": "2019-01-29", "last_modified_date": "2019-01-29", "readtime": "2.98", "claps": 809, "voters": 28, "content": "GoChain Turns One, Rebrands with an Increased Focus on Enterprise AdoptionGoChain will bring the benefits of decentralized blockchain technology to the masses with tailor-made Enterprise offerings that will improve technology, services and infrastructure across the globe.GoChainGoFollowJan 29 \u00b7 3 min readOur first tweet was on Jan. 15th, 2018, marking the very beginning of GoChain\u2019s journey. We started with an idea to fix the blockchain scaling problem while bringing an enterprise team and business philosophy to the space. It quickly turned into a global community of developers and amazing supporters. We hit our goal of fixing the scaling problem by providing a public blockchain network that handles 100x the volume of Ethereum, while remaining 100% Ethereum compatible.Now it\u2019s time to focus on our users and customers to bring real world use cases to Blockchain. GoChain is the most reliable and highest performance Ethereum/web3 compatible blockchain on the market today. Hands down. We stand behind this claim and please do try to prove us wrong.This means that GoChain is not only one of the best performing public networks, but is also the best option for companies that want to run a private blockchain network. GoChain was built with trusted networks and the Enterprise market in mind and we\u2019ve optimized for that scenario.The State of BlockchainPut simply, there hasn\u2019t been much adoption of the public blockchain infrastructure. Most of the most popular dApps are gambling based and aren\u2019t going to bring the masses to the space. This is far from the vision of scalable dApps with real use cases that will convert people over from legacy systems.Currently, most centralized applications in our world work pretty well. If we want to see mass adoption of dApps, the changeover for the average user must be frictionless with very obvious benefits. To date we have yet to see any of these anywhere in the space.After watching the space over the past few years, we think the future of blockchain is going to be built in the enterprise world first. It\u2019s very important to note that there\u2019s a huge difference between cryptocurrency and blockchain especially when it relates to the enterprise market. Large companies are always looking for scalable technology to make things faster, better, easier, and cheaper. We plan to help many companies achieve this with blockchain technology and solutions built on GoChain.Enterprise ServicesStarting immediately, GoChain Enterprise Services (GOES) is now providing enterprise level consulting, training and support! If your business needs help implementing blockchain solutions, the GoChain team is here to help. We live and breathe blockchain and can help you architect and implement the proper solution you need today.We also provide onsite workshops for Enterprise teams to get in-depth blockchain training from beginner to advanced. Think of it as a blockchain bootcamp for your business.Learn moreBlockchain for the MassesOne of the biggest problems with blockchain mass adoption has been its lack of usability. It\u2019s generally a terrible user experience and we\u2019re on a mission to change that. In 2019, you\u2019ll be seeing several new initiatives we\u2019re working on to make it easier for developers to make dApps and deploy blockchain solutions for real world use cases. These initiatives will also make it easier for end users to interact with these dapps. Stay tuned.Rebranding and Renewed FocusAs GoChain has grown over the past year we feel it\u2019s necessary to embrace a new image that can grow along with it. With that, we would like to introduce the new GoChain logo below and tagline, \u201cThe Blockchain Company\u201d.GoChain is no longer just a network protocol. It\u2019s an evolving and growing ecosystem. We have an increased focus on being the group that helps bring blockchain to the forefront of technology and innovation.Please note, we still plan on helping ICOs, STOs, and dApps build on GoChain but with a heavy focus on building real world solutions to advance the GoChain ecosystem and blockchain technology itself.

Anyone can build a decentralized exchange using 0x protocol. Linda Xie wrote an awesome blog about 0x protocol which you can read here.What is decentralize exchange (DeX)?The main property of a decentralize exchange is giving custodianship to user/traders of their own asset. Unlike a centralized crypto exchange (ex \u2014 coinbase, binance) where the exchange stores a user\u2019s private key, in decentralized exchange, private keys always remain with the the users, hence the user is always in control of his own asset. Isn\u2019t it amazing?SourceWhat Is A Relayer?A Relayer hosts an off-chain order book. Using relayers, users can find, create, fill or cancel orders. Relayers helps traders discover counter-parties and move cryptographically orders between them. A relayer can talk to other relayers and create a pool of orders to increase liquidity.How To Build A Relayer?I\u2019ve been following the 0x protocol since last year and they have one of the best developer wikis out there!0x makes it so just about anyone can build a decentralized exchange and earn money. If an entire exchange is too much, you can start with just building a relayer. Today decentralized exchanges are in their infancy stage, but improved tech and UX will attract more people towards DeX in future. Now let\u2019s start building our relayer.Prerequisite-Basic understanding of smart contracts.Basic Understanding of node jsBasic Understanding of ganacheBasic understanding of exchange terminologyInstallationClone the 0x starter project from GitHub.git clone https://github.com/0xProject/0x-starter-project.gitInstall all the dependencies (we use Yarn: brew install yarn --without-node):yarnPull the latest Ganache 0x snapshot with all the 0x contracts pre-deployed:yarn download_snapshotIn a separate terminal, navigate to the project directory and start Ganache:yarn ganache-cliCreate, validate and fill an orderIn this tutorial, we will perform three operations.Create an orderValidate itFill it using ganacheNow we will understand how to create an order, validate it and fill it using 0x-starter-project.ImportsWe will import different utilities which will help us throughout this tutorial. We will also import configuration files. For now, we are using ganache with already 0x smart contracts are deployed privately.import {    assetDataUtils,    BigNumber,    ContractWrappers,    generatePseudoRandomSalt,    Order,    orderHashUtils,    signatureUtils,} from '0x.js';import { Web3Wrapper } from '@0x/web3-wrapper';import { NETWORK_CONFIGS, TX_DEFAULTS } from '../configs';import { DECIMALS, NULL_ADDRESS, ZERO } from '../constants';import { getContractAddressesForNetwork, getContractWrappersConfig } from '../contracts';import { PrintUtils } from '../print_utils';import { providerEngine } from '../provider_engine';import { getRandomFutureDateInSeconds } from '../utils';You can find all these files the 0x-starter-project. Go check out them, look at configurations and settings.Provider and constructorWe need to initialize contractWrappers. This provides helper functions around 0x contracts as well as ERC20/ERC721 token contracts on the blockchain. It takes provideEngine and network configuration of ganache, which will be running by default on http://localhost:8545.const contractWrappers = new ContractWrappers(providerEngine, getContractWrappersConfig(NETWORK_CONFIGS.networkId));Web3Provider - Web3 provider allows your application to communicate with an Ethereum Node. A provider can be any module or class instance that implements thesendAsync method (simply send in web3 V1.0 Beta). That's it. What this sendAsyncmethod does is take JSON RPC payload requests and handles them. Web3.js is an example of a javascript module that contains a Web3 HTTP Provider. Using a configured Web3 Provider, the application can request signatures, estimate gas and gas price, and submit transactions to an Ethereum node. The simplest example of a provider is:const provider = new web3.providers.HttpProvider('http://localhost:8545');This provider simply takes each JSON RPC payload it receives and sends it on to the Ethereum node running on port 8545.\u00b9Initialize web3wrapper and get address informationInitialize the Web3Wrapper using provideEngine, this provides helper functions around fetching account information.const web3Wrapper = new Web3Wrapper(providerEngine);const [maker, taker] = await web3Wrapper.getAvailableAddressesAsync();Initializing addressFor this tutorial, we are trading ZRX token with WETH (wrapped eth, erc20 compatible version of eth, eth itself is not ERC20 compatible token, Eth and weth has 1:1 exchange ratio). For that, we need to have the contract address of our 0x protocol to execute orders and ZRX token and WETH token\u2019s ERC20 contract.const contractAddresses = getContractAddressesForNetwork(NETWORK_CONFIGS.networkId);const zrxTokenAddress = contractAddresses.zrxToken;const etherTokenAddress = contractAddresses.etherToken;Encoding AssetsFor this tutorial, maker (seller/order creator) is creating an order of 5 ZRX tokens in exchange of .1 weth. We also need to take care of decimal points as different tokens can use different decimal points. In our case both weth/eth and zrx has 18 decimal points. 0x v2 uses Ethereum ABI encoding scheme to encode asset data into hex strings to encode all the information needed to identify an asset. That\u2019s what we are doing here.const makerAssetAmount = Web3Wrapper.toBaseUnitAmount(new BigNumber(5), DECIMALS);const takerAssetAmount = Web3Wrapper.toBaseUnitAmount(new BigNumber(0.1), DECIMALS);const makerAssetData = assetDataUtils.encodeERC20AssetData(zrxTokenAddress);const takerAssetData = assetDataUtils.encodeERC20AssetData(etherTokenAddress);Allowance for transacting assetsWe need to allow 0x contract to move assets on the behalf or maker and taker. As we are transacting ETH so first we need to convert ETH into WETH by depositing ETH on WETH contract.const makerZRXApprovalTxHash = await contractWrappers.erc20Token.setUnlimitedProxyAllowanceAsync(        zrxTokenAddress,        maker,);const takerWETHApprovalTxHash = await contractWrappers.erc20Token.setUnlimitedProxyAllowanceAsync(        etherTokenAddress,        taker,);const takerWETHDepositTxHash = await contractWrappers.etherToken.depositAsync(        etherTokenAddress,        takerAssetAmount,        taker,);Creating an Order0x protocol has below specific parameters which are needed to create an order. We will set these parameters and will create our order. We will use NULL_ADDRESS allowing anyone to fill our order.exchangeAddress : The Exchange address.makerAddress : Ethereum address of our Maker.takerAddress : Ethereum address of our Taker.senderAddress : Ethereum address of a required Sender (none for now).feeRecipientAddress : Ethereum address of our Relayer (none for now).expirationTimeSeconds: When will the order expire (in unix time).salt: Random number to make the order (and therefore its hash) unique.makerAssetAmount: The amount of token the Maker is offering.takerAssetAmount: The amount of token the Maker is requesting from the Taker.makerAssetData: The token address the Maker is offering.takerAssetData: The token address the Maker is requesting from the Taker.makerFee: How many ZRX the Maker will pay as a fee to the Relayer.takerFee : How many ZRX the Taker will pay as a fee to the Relayer.const randomExpiration = getRandomFutureDateInSeconds();const exchangeAddress = contractAddresses.exchange;const order: Order = {        exchangeAddress,        makerAddress: maker,        takerAddress: NULL_ADDRESS,        senderAddress: NULL_ADDRESS,        feeRecipientAddress: NULL_ADDRESS,        expirationTimeSeconds: randomExpiration,        salt: generatePseudoRandomSalt(),        makerAssetAmount,        takerAssetAmount,        makerAssetData,        takerAssetData,        makerFee: ZERO,        takerFee: ZERO,};Signing OrderNow we need to sign the order with maker\u2019s private key so we can prove that specificed maker address is owned by maker. We will append this signature to our order. To do that we will perform these steps:Generate a hash from our order.Sign generated the hash using maker\u2019s private keyappend signature with the orderconst orderHashHex = orderHashUtils.getOrderHashHex(order);const signature = await signatureUtils.ecSignHashAsync(providerEngine, orderHashHex, maker);const signedOrder = { ...order, signature };Validating OrderWe need to validate the order is Fillable before calling fillOrder This checks both the maker and taker balances and allowances to ensure it is fillable up to takerAssetAmount. Also if there is any order manipulation by anyone, we will also get to know by validating our order.await contractWrappers.exchange.validateFillOrderThrowIfInvalidAsync(signedOrder, takerAssetAmount, taker);Filling OrderNow if everything worked fine then we can validate our order now using 0x protocol. We will also set the gas limit for executing our order.txHash = await contractWrappers.exchange.fillOrderAsync(signedOrder, takerAssetAmount, taker, {        gasLimit: TX_DEFAULTS.gas,});That\u2019s it. We have filled our order.yarn scenario:fill_order_erc20You will see output something like below. If you see the fill_order_erc20.ts.

we can create and fill orders using 0x protocol.We are using ganache but we can submit and fill the order to a relayer using 0x/connect (which is a wrapper of 0x protocol\u2019s Standard Relayer API) We will check this in future tutorials. Check out the Crowdbotics blog for more on this topic.Next, we\u2019ll discuss different order book strategies. If you have any doubt you can refer to 0x project docs. They have awesome documentation.Please comment below, if you have more questions about building your own decentralize exchange or relayer.Thanks!Starting a new blockchain project, or looking for a Solidity developer?Crowdbotics helps business build cool things with Solidity (among other things).

But what are Vaults, what\u2019s Phase 1, and why\u2019s this such big news?Going back to basics, the Network is essentially made up of three key components: Clients, Vaults and Routing. The work related to this release focuses on the first two: Clients and Vaults. But we\u2019ll come back to Routing in a moment.The SAFE Network is made up of nodes which run Vaults. A Vault is a program that runs on a device which connects the device to the Network and manages the storage and other basic Network functions. Collectively, Vaults manage the storage of all data by managing the movement of chunks of encrypted user data that are stored across the Network. A Client, on the other hand, is a program that allows users to connect and use the Network. For this release, the Client is the SAFE Browser and the SAFE CLI.So how does Routing fit in?Routing is essentially the bit that connects Vaults to other Vaults. And at this stage, we\u2019ll not be integrating Routing. Why? Put simply, focusing on Clients and Vaults sets up the foundations for the Network. We\u2019ll add the Routing component (which we\u2019ve been building in parallel) once this is up and running. Then you\u2019ll be able to connect to other users (i.e. multiple Vaults) on the Network. And voila! Then you\u2019ll be looking at the early version of a fully decentralised SAFE Network!We tend to talk about future users of the Network in three loose categories: Consumers (people using the Network to browse, share data, etc.), Creators (developers or those publishing content) and Farmers. If we take the first two groups, Consumers and Creators, this release was for you. Farmers, sorry you\u2019ll have to wait just a little longer\u2026 but hopefully not too long\u2026Hmmm, still not sure I get it?If you\u2019re less technical, understanding how these three components work with each other can be a little tricky to get your head around. So let\u2019s try an analogy to help contextualise what's happening here.Imagine these Vaults are islands. On your island, you\u2019re fairly self-sufficient: you can build things and you can survive just fine. But you can\u2019t connect with any other islands (Vaults) around the world.Now, to travel from one island to another, what you really need is a boat. With transport, all of a sudden you can connect to other islands and your life is now enriched. You can communicate and you can share resources. But most importantly? You\u2019ve now joined a growing community. Swap out \u2018boats\u2019 for \u2018Routing\u2019 and I\u2019m pretty sure you get the idea. Add the connections and Vaults now start to become so \u2014 so \u2014 much more.What\u2019s included in this release?If you download the release, what are you going to get? How about the first stages of data types, test Safecoin and a user interface in the form of a CLI (a simple command-line tool with some fundamental features)? It\u2019s the basic framework for the full Network \u2014 with many additional features to come.OK, I\u2019m sold! How do I get involved?To use the new updates, you will be able to download a Vault binary (aka file!) which will run locally on your computer. Details and links can be found on this Forum post.So what\u2019s next?While this Phase 1 Vault release is primarily to showcase the Network features to Consumers and Creators, we now turn to the Farmers \u2014 in other words, introducing the Vault\u2019s capability to farm Safecoin. So further releases will be building on these previous versions. We\u2019ll be decentralising the Vaults, introducing PARSEC, integrating with Routing, Secure Message Delivery, Reliable Message Delivery and BLS encryption.What to know more about what's included in this release?

I picked Ethereum because I\u2019ve experimented before with the technology\u2026 without success. At that time, Ethereum was still in its infancy. Today, I see Ethereum as a toddler, worth a second attempt. I\u2019ll go through some important steps I\u2019ve taken and things I\u2019ve noticed. Disclaimer: This is not a full tutorial. An all-encompassing tutorial can be found here.Install EthereumI\u2019ve created a separate Virtual Machine with Ubuntu 16.04 for this experiment. This experiment will make use of a local private Ethereum test network for easy development. Ethereum can be installed on your machine with the following commands:sudo apt-get install software-properties-commonsudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:ethereum/ethereumsudo apt-get updatesudo apt-get install ethereumThis allows us to use geth with the command line interface. Geth is a Go client for use with Mist, suitable for Dapp development. This will be useful later in this article.Defining the Genesis blockA Genesis block is the first block in the chain, block 0, and the only block that does not point to a predecessor block. When first looking into Genesis block definitions, I was a bit confused. There are many variations (1, 2, 3) out there on the Internet. A custom Genesis block allows you to change specific configuration settings for your private Ethereum blockchain like gas limit and mining difficulty.The first Genesis block definition I found, is the one defined by the official Go-Ethereum documentation.{    \"config\": {        \"chainId\": 15,        \"homesteadBlock\": 0,        \"eip155Block\": 0,        \"eip158Block\": 0    },    \"difficulty\": \"200000000\",    \"gasLimit\": \"2100000\",    \"alloc\": {        \"7df9a875a174b3bc565e6424a0050ebc1b2d1d82\": {             \"balance\": \"300000\"         },        \"f41c74c9ae680c1aa78f42e5647a62f353b7bdde\": {             \"balance\": \"400000\"         }    }}I tried to initialize the Genesis block with this configuration, however, geth rejected the config file. Why? We are allocating funds to non-existing addresses (wallets). If you want to allocate funds to certain addresses to avoid the need for mining, you have to create those with geth. A new account can be easily created with geth account new. The command will return a new address which you can add to your custom Genesis file under the \"alloc\" field.The example by Go-Ethereum is the most basic version of a custom Genesis file (required fields: config, difficulty, gasLimit and alloc). I\u2019ll try to give a proper explanation for the relevant options and the values used (1):\u201cconfig\u201d: Contains the blockchain configuration.- \u201cchainId\u201d: ChainId identifies the current chain and is used for replay attack protection.- \u201chomesteadBlock\u201d: Indicates that you are using the Homestead version release of Ethereum.\u201cdifficulty\u201d: Sets the mining difficulty applied during the discovery of the first block. The value used is a scalar value. It is recommended to use a low value so you can easily gain Ether to fund your accounts and avoid long waiting times during test execution since mining a valid block is required to execute a transaction on the blockchain. The lowest value you can set is 0x4000 which allows you to mine blocks within 100\u2019s of milliseconds.\u201cgasLimit\u201d: A chain-wide limit of Gas expenditure per block. I\u2019ve set this value very high to avoid being limited during testing. Keep in mind to check the Gas consumption of your smart contracts. A very high consumption should be avoided and mostly indicates that there\u2019s something wrong with your smart contract.\u201calloc\u201d: This field gives the possibility to define pre-filled addresses. This field accepts a value expressed in Wei. One Ether results in 10000000000000000000 Wei.Playing around with GethBlockchain deamonDeamon to keep private blockchain running in background with the use of the geth command.

Note the --rpcapi option, here we can define which APIs we want to have at our disposal over the HTTP-RPC interface (default: \u201ceth, net, web3\u201d). It is a good idea to include personal, parity, miner as well.Useful Geth commandsFirst, let\u2019s attach the geth console to the rpcport with > get attach http://0.0.0.0:8000. This allows us to use the APIs for creating an account and starting a miner.Create new account: > personal.newAccount(\"password\")Unlock account:> personal.unlockAccount(eth.accounts[0], \"password\", 0) You\u2019ve to unlock your account each time you start a new geth console. As the first parameter, you give the account you want to unlock. You can also use personal.listAccounts[0]. The last parameter indicates that we want to unlock the account for an indefinite period until the geth console is closed.Check balance for specific account (Ether):> web3.fromWei(web3.eth.getBalance(web3.eth.accounts[0]))Set Etherbase account to allocate mined funds:> miner.setEtherbase(personal.listAccounts[0])Start 4 miner threads (it\u2019s normal that the function returns a null value):> miner.start(4)Check hashrate (~check if miner is operational):> miner.getHashrate()Stop miner:> miner.stop()Web3 API ReferenceIt is possible to use the Web3 API object in your code. This allows you to interact with your private blockchain. Here are some code snippets to indicate the use with JavaScript.Let\u2019s start with the connection to the rpcpath, and immediately unlock your main account.export function initWebService() {    web3.setProvider(     new web3.providers.HttpProvider(       'http://localhost:8000',        0,        \"0x8d2e50cd0e654399229cF88cb05E0F3074928FCe\",        \"password\"     )  )}Next, I want to display all the accounts and balances (logged in console). As you can see, the commands are exactly the same as in the geth console.export function getAccounts() {     return web3.eth.getAccounts( (err, accs) => {         if (err != null) {             return 'There was an error fetching your accounts.'     }else if (accs.length == 0) {             return 'Couldn\\'t get any accounts!'         } else {              accs.forEach( acc => {                 web3.eth.getBalance(acc).then( balance => {            console.log(balance)                                            })             })          }    }) }Full project can be found here: https://github.com/michielmulders/web3-ethereum-api-test/tree/masterSources(1) https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/2376/what-does-each-genesis-json-parameter-mean Credits for explaining the Genesis parameters.(2) https://steemit.com/ethereum/@nphacker/setting-up-and-running-a-private-ethereum-blockchain-on-ubuntu Credits for using the deamon script which I have slightly changed.(3) https://souptacular.gitbooks.io/ethereum-tutorials-and-tips-by-hudson/content/private-chain.html Another definition with different values for Genesis config file.(4) Kevin Leyssens: Many thanks for the documentation and code you provided.", "responses": 1, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Ethereum Blockchain", "Geth", "Web3", "Nodejs"]}, {"title": "The Buidling Blocks", "post_link": "https://medium.com/balance-io/the-buidling-blocks-5770c698007f?source=search_post", "author_name": "Richard Burton", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@ricburton", "publish_date": "2018-03-13", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-20", "readtime": "1.64", "claps": 360, "voters": 26, "content": "The Buidling BlocksThoughts on EthCCRichard BurtonFollowMar 13, 2018 \u00b7 2 min readLast week I attended the Ethereum Community Conference in Paris. Since then, I have been processing all of the technical presentations, in-depth discussions, late-night debates, and new projects I came across at this incredible event. After some time, my thoughts have started to orbit around a central theme: the buidling blocks for third web are here.EthCC was held at the Conservatoire National des Arts et M\u00e9tiers, ParisI grew up building things on the web we have today. I would write code on my computer and push it to a server that a company controlled. When I stopped paying them, my website would stop working. My customers\u2019 data would be stored on a database that I managed. Everyone had a username and password to log in. This was the way to make things on the web. I was using the tools that were available. It is really tricky to shake off that mental model and think about the web we will have tomorrow. Too often, I find myself wanting to build products with the tools I am used to. Instead, I need to force myself to think about what is going to be possible with this new development stack.Whenever I worry about how slow Ethereum is, I need to dive into Tendermint Consensus, Parity\u2019s Bridges, Counterfactual\u2019s state channels, Plasma Cash, Casper\u2019s shards & Keep\u2019s off-chain computation.Whenever I am too scared to write Solidity, I should check out Truffle\u2019s new debugger, Zeppelin\u2019s work on contract upgrades, Axoni\u2019s work on formal verification for contracts.Whenever I think about storing data on a server, I should try push encrypted files to the networks from Storj, Sia, IPFS & NuCypher.Whenever I think about using a centralised exchange, I should try out AirSwap\u2019s peer-to-peer network, Gnosis\u2019 Dutch Auction and Cosmos peg zones.Whenever I think about building a company, I should experiment with Aragon\u2019s point-and-click DAO-creator and Colony\u2019s work management tools.I stumbled into the Ethereum project in 2015 and helped out with a few interface design concepts before the sale.

This is a key part of creating a web that prevents the alteration, manipulation or deletion of public data. Why? Because it means that it will then be impossible to rewrite history.But instead of taking a broad-brush approach and only letting data be stored in perpetuity, we\u2019ve looked at different use cases and thought about circumstances in which data needs to be stored differently. We have 8 different data types. Sounds overcomplicated? Don\u2019t worry, it isn\u2019t.Let\u2019s start breaking this down.Unpublished/PublishedFirst up, at a very basic level, data will either be private (unpublished) or public (published). Private data is information you want to keep private on the Network or, perhaps, share on a very restricted basis. Private data can be deleted.Public data is information that is published to the Network. Everyone can see it. We call this The Perpetual Web and it can\u2019t be removed from the Network. HOWEVER, there are various types of public data which show previous versions (with different data types utilising a combination of edits and amends). Just like the Internet Archive today stores versions of websites even if they were published with mistakes, the whole life of websites (which is by definition, public data) will be available to view to all.The main thing to remember: anything that is public is perpetual. That is, it can never be deleted.So we have two categories, published and unpublished. But we\u2019ve broken this down even further and we\u2019ll explore each data type below. As you will see, some are exclusive to either public or private and some data types can have either property.AppendOnlyThis data type can be either public or private. You can make changes or edits to the data and it\u2019ll result in a new version - but you can\u2019t change or edit the existing one. Hence the name AppendOnly as you can append the new versions.So if you published a research paper for the public as AppendOnly data, the content of that paper could never be changed. BUT you could create/upload a new version that corrects or adds more information to the original paper. If you wanted the ability to delete this additional information, you would have to upload this as private data. This is a very important point to make. The Perpetual Web (Fundamental 8) means data should live in perpetuity\u2026but, circumstances may require you to store private data so that you have the option of deleting it.ImmutableDataNext up is ImmutableData. Again, this can be either Published or Unpublished data \u2014 but ImmutableData cannot be changed in any way (hence the name immutable). This would be perfect for storing files on the Network such as public scientific reports where it is vital from a societal perspective that these can not be changed or manipulated (public) or for storing private files which can be deleted by the user if he or so chooses (private).MutableDataThen we have Mutable. MutableData can be altered, changed and manipulated. So it has to be in the unpublished category (since published data by definition cannot). It cannot be published on the Network. Perhaps you are a researcher who needs to adapt your argument during the course of your research. You need the ability to make alterations to your work. As this is private data, it can only ever be viewed by you and anyone you give permission to. You are also the only one who has the ability to make those changes.Sequenced/UnsequencedNot a data type per se, but we also have Sequenced and Unsequenced data. This lets data be versioned, or ordered. This design is pertinent in understanding things like how online articles have been edited or corrected over time. This applies to all the data except for ImmutableData.One more thing to note: within the unpublished data types, there is the ability to store unpublished data on the network and share it with a selected group of users. The user should be able to give permissions like read, write, append based on the use case.So what does this look like?To help make sense of this, we\u2019ve plotted the different data types in the diagram with a brief description for each given below.SequencedPublishedAppendOnlyDataSequencedPublishedAppendOnlyData: This is a data type that is ordered, public and only appends may be made \u2014 no edits and this data type cannot be deleted.UnsequencedPublishedAppendOnlyData: This is a data type is public (therefore cannot be deleted) and no edits can be made.SequencedUnpublishedAppendOnlyData: This is a data type that is versioned, private and no edits can be made.UnsequencedUnpublishedAppendOnlyData: This is a data type that is not versioned, private and appends can be made.PublishedImmutableData: This data is public and unable to be edited or altered or deleted.UnpublishedImmutableData: All you can do with this data set is basically upload, read and delete.UnpublishedSequencedMutableData: This is ordered data that is private and can be changed as much as the owner wants.UnpublishedUnsequencedMutableData: This is the same as above, but not ordered.And what does that mean for a developer?All these data types are all well and good but what does this actually mean? What does it enable a developer to do?Let\u2019s try some examples.Say you wanted to create a music sharing or streaming application. You would need it to be public so people could see it, so it would fall into the Published bracket.However, if you wanted a Snapchat-esque application in order to share messages with a private group of friends, you could choose UnpublishedAppendableData (so content can be deleted, just like SnapChat) or maybe MutableData.So these are examples of one data type, the likelihood is the developer will need to use a combination of data types. Staying on a similar theme, imagine rebuilding Medium. You need somewhere to draft the post \u2014 so let\u2019s use MutableData to cover the various changes you\u2019d make in the editing process. You\u2019d then need somewhere you can post the final content for the public: how about PublishedImmutableData? And finally, you want a place where readers can leave comments (so we\u2019d suggest PublishedAppendableData).Permissions play a big role here. So how can you create a forum with PublishedAppend that others can add things onto it, or how is that with UnpublishedAppendOnly my family can edit a doc even if it\u2019s unpublished? This all relies on the permissions and ownership of the data. We won\u2019t go into too much detail here, but for those of you who are interested in how this works, we recommend you check this post out which details out one of our key Front End milestones (Take Control of Your Data).These might be oversimplified examples, but generally any combination of the 8 data sets can be built \u2014 all you need is a good idea.There we have it: one SAFE Network, eight data types.

You might have encountered our memes. And you might even be in one of our telegram groups \u2014 even perhaps several.But you might still ask:What is MetaCartel?MetaCartel\u2019s first dinner in DevCon Prague 2019. This was the first time we realized that we were more than just a technical working group. It was a true family dinner.We began nearly a year ago as a technical working group that looked to standardize meta transactions and decentralize the execution of them. And we just wanted to have fun while we were at it.The telegram chat voted in a funny name and then later adopted the chili as our logo. We never took ourselves too seriously, and I think to our benefit as well. You can read more about the initial folklore here.And since, the MetaCartel has evolved wildly beyond my imagination.As the working group progressed through engineering and research problems around meta transactions, MetaCartel along the way developed a strongly held internal belief around the importance of community. Over time, we all collectively experienced the power of coming together and collaborating on shared problems \u2014 and has since become the core value of MetaCartel.Working with each other and helping each other succeed.We realized how much further we could all go if we worked together. And over the last half year, as TabooKey made the key research breakthrough on enabling meta transactions \u2014 the MetaCartel was a working group with no more problems to solve.But we had this community, and also this culture of collaboration. And soon, we began to work on other ecosystem problems around the application layer aside from meta transactions. We began to evolve. The community sharded off to work on meta transactions, others went on to work on a DAO, community members joined each other\u2019s teams and other members started companies amongst themselves. We kept holding MetaCartel meetups, from Denver, Paris, Sydney and even kept going with our occasional virtual community calls.Despite us all beginning to work on different problems and starting new projects, we kept in touch and more than that \u2014 we had a special bond between all of us. It\u2019s safe to say, we aren\u2019t just a community anymore. But rather an entire network of people, communities, companies, working groups, teams, collaborations, partnerships, DAOs.If you want to go quick, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.We are a cartel.MetaCartel started out as a meme that rallied projects together to collaborate on meta transactions. And like all great memes, they spread. MetaCartel has now become its own community ecosystem of projects revolving around the Web 3.0 application layer.We are working on a DAO to fund experimentation around usability and UX advancements as well as new web 3.0 technology use cases.We are working on launching DAOs with various communities (Yang DAO, Kitty DAO, etc.) and innovating on the user experience of DAOs.We are working on building out a decentralized hub to enable users to be onboarded to dapps with meta transactions in a trustless manner.We are working on building a community of dapp developers, helping them find feedback and connect with one another.We are working on a podcast that interviews various DApps developers, surfacing insights around new user behaviors and product paradigms.We are working on launching \u2018Demo Day\u2019, a community conference focused on shared learnings from shipping dapps to real people.We are working on a Libra Ethereum bridge to enable wrapped Libra on Ethereum and hopefully also the first ever dapp on Libra.And this is just a brief peek into the world of MetaCartel. It\u2019s hard to pinpoint down what we are working on as we are always moving. Always working on something. Here is a map of our telegram chat world\u2026The MetaCartel \u2018cartel\u2019It\u2019s evolved beyond what I ever thought it could become.I am in awe of what MetaCartel has become. And inspired by what it can be.And so grateful and thankful for everyone in the community that I have shared the journey with so far. Thank you.How to jump in and get involved?MetaCartel has always grown organically through referrals and one to one relationships.

That epoch was termed as Blockchain 1.0. Blockchain was thought of just as a decentralized ledger to make bitcoin transactions. Soon after that, it was realized that blockchain technology could be explored for other diverse ventures as well like supply chain, banking, entertainment, data management and what not! Ethereum blockchain was realized as Blockchain 2.0 with smart contract capabilities which fulfilled the horizons of blockchain fitting into multiple industries.Blockchain 3.0 is all about taking PoCs on Blockchain 2.0 to a production-grade level.Blockchain 3.0 strives to solve the current engineering issues that plague blockchain tech at the moment. Issues like scalability and adaptability put a question mark to its usability. Many projects are working relentlessly to push blockchain to a genuinely usable level. The future of Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) is contingent upon interoperability of the ledgers, otherwise, each ledger would stay siloed without any knowledge about what is happening beyond it. Bridging the gap between all the disparate, siloed chains is the need of the hour.Remarkable research and engineering are put in by projects like Plasma, Polkadot, Cosmos, Loom Network, Raiden, Lightning Network, Infura, Pocket Network, QuikNode. Each of these projects is trying to use a different approach to solve the existing issues. Some are trying to achieve sharding; some are trying to employ sidechaining and off-chaining. Some are trying to automate infrastructure capabilities to run blockchain networks seamlessly.Not only are the projects and protocols advancing, the development tools are also becoming more mature. Some blockchain development tools like Truffle, Geth, Parity, MetaMask, Web3.js, Solc, Embark, OpenZeppelin (the list goes on); the dApp ecosystem has come a very long way! The arcane development of Zero-Knowledge Proofs is made easy by ZoKrates (a toolbox for zkSNARKS on Ethereum). A lot of latest development tools is curated by QuikNode which can be found here. ConsenSys also contributed a similar list. The input has been so immense that projects and protocols which launched just over a year ago have started addressing issues on the ground level efficaciously.This gives an overall impression that all contributions made in the blockchain sphere have empowered developers to stretch their legs to create blockchain applications quicker and with less friction than ever before, thereby generating value.QuikNode has built the fastest and easiest way to run an Ethereum node without the headache of infrastructure scaleup. Its platform enables blockchain developers to power and scale their dApps by providing reliable and high performance Ethereum nodes. The idea of exposing node-as-a-service is captivating multiple projects and protocols over the world because it solves the problem of hardware scaling. The rationale behind such an approach is to go completely serverless with your blockchain network.Multiple projects are leveraging the ease-of-use of QuikNode\u2019s node-as-a-service like DAOstack, Etheremon, Elixir, Canya, etc. Projects like Loopring, an open-source protocol to build decentralized exchanges, has given way to applications like Dolomite. InstaDapp, a decentralized bank, and also the team behind MakerScan and easwapHQ, too have built their applications using \u201c2.0\u201d protocols like MakerDAO (pioneers of the $DAI stablecoin).The following data establishes the expansion and progress of the dApp ecosystem:Source: https://www.stateofthedapps.com/statsSource: https://www.stateofthedapps.com/statsSource: https://www.stateofthedapps.com/statsSource: https://www.stateofthedapps.com/statsOther platforms like dapp.com are a single-stop resource for keeping up with the most recent dApps across Ethereum, EOS, Steem, and TRON.Source: dapp.comSource: dapp.comSource: dapp.comdApp explorers like these are striving to create an entire ecosystem to stir up wind for dApp development, awareness, and usage.

The ease and simplicity with which development is taking place surely have room for improvement.However, even today there are dApps for almost all mainstream use-cases. We are inching towards Web 3.0 revolution with great agility and alacrity.

Much of this content is our annotated take on their publication with a less-technical perspective for users who are closely following the Polkadot project, but with room to learn along the way. In this and future less-technical Simplified Developer Updates, we\u2019ll focus on breaking down the terms and processes being referenced as the Internet of Blockchains is constructed. With this perspective, we aim to welcome and to educate a broader audience along the way.The initial version of the Polkadot specification (glossary), is available here: here: https://github.com/w3f/polkadot-spec/blob/master/spec.md. Further, a list of terms covered in each Simplified Developer Update will be available at the end of each post.In the weeks since the Polkadot Fundraiser, the team has started to tackle some major initial building blocks, such as block headers and transaction format. For reference, block headers are the method by which distributed ledgers (blockchains) identify block position, number, or height, and notate where in the chain a block belongs. Block headers reference older blocks in their code which help to track the root from which each block was created. This root is identifiable and has a traceable history through a Merkle Tree, which is explained here.The Parity team will speak to transaction format once further details are settled upon, but initial implementations are now being written in code. The first Proof of Concept, or PoC-1 (an early experimental version of our application that demonstrates feasibility and early functionality), will have all of the relay chain contracts (One of the contracts deployed on the Relay Chain that govern the behaviour of Polkadot) implemented in an open source programming language called Rust. In the following release, the aim is to allow the contracts to be compiled together with the rest of the codebase into native code. Later, contracts will be compiled to WebAssembly, a quick web-centric format that grew from javascript, and ran using Polkadot\u2019s interpreter (a program that directly executes code without precompiling into another application).Initial work has also begun on the Polkadot networking protocol, a protocol for exchanging blocks, transactions, block candidates, consensus messages, and more over the network. The first version is based on devp2p, but is designed to be based on libp2p in the future.For some background, devp2p is the backbone of Ethereum, working as a secure networking system or communication layer that allows for peer-to-peer connection and more while remaining simple in nature. Libp2p is more feature rich than devp2p and backs a technology called IPFS (InterPlanetary File System; a distributed file system aimed at world-wide connection for use as a database or subsystem like HTTP with the potential to realize a serverless internet). This more advanced system seeks to power a distributed web that treats web data a bit like bittorrent handles files, allowing for separation and decentralization from our current server filled data centers.PoC-1 will support syncing the relay chain in full mode (a complete validation state, akin to a full node on another chain) backed by devp2p and connectivity management (managing network connections to connect only to relevant parties: e.g. collators or validators) to be added later via libp2p.Parity has also maintained the contracts repo, an open-source code repository, located on github, adding administration features to Proof of Authority (PoA). As explained on Parity\u2019s github, Proof-of-Authority is a replacement for Proof-of-Work often used for private chain setups. It does not depend on a distributed set of users and nodes to solve arbitrarily difficult mathematical problems (how Proof-of-Work functions), but instead uses a set of \u201cauthorities\u201d \u2014 nodes that are explicitly allowed to create new blocks and secure the blockchain. This is less secure from a standpoint of decentralization, but simplifies testing and improves speed in a non-distributed setting. These updates allow a specific contract to make non-standard state transitions or changes through log events. Additionally, developers are creating a contract that issues those log events upon the approval of the current set of authorities.In other news, during an optimization sprint the team managed to reduce webassembly binaries by about 80%. This is significant as by reducing size, the size of the database and amount of network traffic is reduced. Additionally, binaries were made suitable for public networks with standard settings (for example, Kovan, Parity Technologies\u2019 Ethereum test network). Changes were also made to improve ergonomics, stability, and documentation of the pwasm (parity WebAssembly) support libraries (-abi, -std, -test). Finally, their team has opened a public channel for parity wasm-related work, everybody from the field is welcome to join https://riot.im/app/#/room/#parity-wasm-public:matrix.orgOther pieces that Parity devs have been working on include the Rust port of libp2p. The initial architecture, a mechanism to subdivide a connection into multiple streams that will be used to connect devp2p to libp2p, and encrypted communication channels are already in place. Additionally the code can successfully interoperate with the echo example (meant to confirm communication in the case of different implementations, for example Rust and JavaScript). Developers are currently working on implementing the upper layers, like the ping protocol, which times the round-trip for sent and received messages, and Kademlia; a technology used to back file peer-to-peer sharing systems like IPFS and bittorrent using decentralization and denial of service resistance.As the year draws to an end, we have lots to focus on, and we thank our friends Parity for their work.

Over 3 Million Smart Contracts were created in November and December 2018 alone! A report shows that 60% of all Ethereum contracts have never been interacted with, less than 10% of all created contracts are unique, and less than 1% of the contracts have the source code available. Another report shows that over 25% of all Smart Contracts created have some kind of bug \ud83d\ude31. Today, we\u2019ll mention a couple of things which can help you build better Smart Contracts!K.I.S.S. Principle (Keep It Simple, Stupid)The KISS principle is well-known when designing a system. Keeping things simple decreases the likelihood of errors. So make your logical flow simple when designing a Smart Contract, so you will end up with a clean & tidy code.ReuseYou don\u2019t need to reinvent the wheel! There are already well-tested libraries and frameworks (e.g. Truffle, OpenZeppelin), which help you build and modularize your logic \u2014 use them \ud83d\ude09. Don\u2019t do things like creating your own random number generator.Software Engineering Design PatternsPatterns help us in solving some very fundamental architectural design problems. Patterns are used by millions of software throughout the word and are already a well-researched area in computer science. Understanding patterns helps you recognize problems fast and come up with better solutions for them. You can find Smart Contract / Solidity design patterns here.There is one particular design pattern which we like: Proxy Delegate. This pattern helps you to upgrade your Contract safely.Test CasesIt\u2019s best to follow TDD (Test-Driven Design): create test-cases before writing your code, and cover positive and negative test cases. Also, try to break your own code and find logical mistakes. You can use solidity-coverage to generate test coverage.Use Security ToolsSmart Contract security should be the utmost priority. You need to find all attack vectors. Smart Contract and ERC-20 tokens have a history of bugs. You can also check out Ethernaut puzzles to get familiar with the most famous security problems. You should also read Vitalik Buterin\u2019s article on Smart Contract security. There are already open source security analysis tools, which you can use to analyze your Smart Contact. Here are a few of them below:VisualizationS\u016brya \u2014 Utility tool for Smart Contract systems, offering a number of visual outputs and information about the contracts\u2019 structure. Also supports querying the function call graph.Solgraph \u2014 Generates a DOT graph that visualizes function control flow of a Solidity contract and highlights potential security vulnerabilities.EVM Lab \u2014 Rich tool package to interact with the EVM.

Solidity major updates may have breaking changes. Here is a list of Smart Contract known attacks.There are a few major things you need to take care of when developing an ERC-20 token:Be aware of front-running attacks on ERC-20Prevent transferring tokens to the 0x0 addressPrevent transferring tokens to the contact addressThere is a better Ethereum standard such as ERC-223 and ERC-777, which you can use as an alternative for ERC-20. Also, Security EIPs are important to be aware of\u2026 either for understanding how the EVM works, or to get informed with best practices when developing a Smart Contract system.Documentation and ProceduresDocumentation is a very important practice when your code is going to handle potentially Millions of dollars. Documentation helps internal and external participants, auditors and independent reviewers to understand your contracts.Create specification, state machines, models which helps others to understand the system.Include a roll-out plan with your documentation.Specify the current version of the compiler.Specify known issues, attack vectors, limitation and potential remedies for them.Specify test converge and reviewers.Maintain a history & keep track of changes over time.Specify contract authors and contributors with their public contact information.Contract AuditingThere are companies which can help you audit your Smart Contract. These services are useful as experts will audit your code for potential vulnerabilities. Highly recommended if you are building a Smart Contract on which your business will depend on.Bug BountiesIt always helps to have more eyes on your code. Bug bounties are excellent in terms of ROI. Below are some tips for running bounty programs:Decide the total budget and currency for your bounty reward.Categories your budget in terms of different type of vulnerabilities.Decide a team for judging the bounty.Mention proper communication channel for reporting of bugs.Use private repos to fix the bug, involve bounty hunter in reviewing the fix.Do not delay in rewarding the bounty hunter.You can check out 0x project bug bounty program.Prepare for failureIf there is code, there is a bug \ud83d\ude04. When it comes to Smart Contracts, create a thorough plan for the worst case scenarios.There are two ways to write error-free programs; only the third one works. (Alan J. Perlis)Here are several tips which can help you to create such a plan for your token:Add a circuit breaker in your Smart Contract which will pause all kinds of transactions.Create a plan for contract upgrades, bugfixes, and improvements.Create a proper guideline and communication channel for disclosure policy.Minimize the impact of bugs and money at risk. Plan what happens in case of money loss. Recourse in case of failure (e.g. insurance, penalty fund, no recourse).ConclusionApart from the above, always optimize your Smart Contract for Gas usage. Prevention is better than the Cure, always try to plan and prevent before things go wrong. In the case of Smart Contracts, the real money will be at stake; you need to be extra careful as the programmer. Always stay updated with the latest changes in Solidity language & compiler and known attacks in the ecosystem. With Ethereum blockchain\u2019s nature of everything being public, and taking into account the current maturity of the ecosystem, guaranteeing that nothing will go wrong is extreme overconfidence (if not foolishness). So build, test, plan, and follow procedures to mitigate potential vulnerabilities in your Smart Contract.

Here, we\u2019ll explore them all in a little detail.We\u2019ve got 20 fundamentals\u2026so let\u2019s start from the beginning.Fundamental #1: The SAFE Network will enable you to create an account and login anonymously and without intervention.So what does this mean? This means that creating a new account and logging into the Network will never require a third party. By removing this requirement, you decrease the chance of being hacked by others attacking those third parties. We truly believe that on the Network, hacking and the theft of your data should never be words that are associated with our online lives.Fundamental #2: The SAFE Network will enable you to securely and with no controlling intermediaries share information and messages.In other words, there will never be any third parties on the SAFE Network who can read or store any information that a User sends \u2014 unless that User explicitly gives his or her consent. That\u2019s vastly different to today\u2019s world where your data is all stored by technology companies in huge data centres, who then use that data to lock you into their platforms so that they can track your every movement in order to sell that data to advertisers. Removing those data stores removes that particular security risk.Fundamental #3: The SAFE Network allows the transfer of Safecoin to any other user free of transaction costs.This means each User of the Network can use any of their identities as a wallet address in order to be able to send and receive Safecoin. And there should be no transaction costs attributed to the simple exchange of value. Take a step back and think about it: money is simply a mathematical construct that enables the transfer of value between two individuals. Data is far more important than money and considerably more valuable. So why should transactions on the Network cost money?Fundamental #4: The Network enables users to anonymously create and share data worldwide.The Network will always ensure that the User has the ability to send transaction messages and posts with a temporary and single-use ID\u2019s that are not linked to any known identity on the Network. This avoids the problem we see today where your personal freedom and anonymity is removed the instant that you can be identified online.All of your behaviour is being tracked by third parties which leads to you being pestered by advertising to sell you stuff you may or may not need...But more seriously, it\u2019s crucial that the SAFE Network gives everyone the right to interact within digital worlds without revealing any personal information at all. Reveal what you choose to those that you wish. It\u2019s a default position that\u2019s fairer for all.Fundamental #5: The SAFE Network will let anyone browse content anonymously and free of charge.It\u2019s essential that the new decentralised web is built without barriers to entry. One of the most important foundations for a global, collaborative platform is that anyone can access public content for free at any time without having to create an account. In today\u2019s world, you need to prove that you are authorised before you can access data: for example, if you want to set up an iTunes account, you first have to verify your identity before you\u2019re able to use the service, plus you have to agree to their terms of service\u2026(all 20,000 words of it). Not so on the SAFE Network. Here, everyone can browse public data without restrictions. That means public information is accessible to all, not hidden behind barriers and wordy T&Cs. Instead, it\u2019s free to retrieve all data and information stored on the Network.Fundamental #6: The SAFE Network allows you to associate multiple identities to your account.How is this useful? Perhaps you want to donate to charity anonymously. No problem, you can use one identity. Perhaps you want to whistleblow on your employer which could lead to severe consequences. No problem, you can use another identity. Need to use one identity only once? No problem. You can easily throw away each identity after a single use, without the fear of it being traced back to you. This is especially pertinent in regimes where censorship is rife and the cost of speaking up could be your life.Fundamental #7: The SAFE Network lets you send or receive Safecoin using any of your identities.This concept is tied into #6: true anonymity requires the ability to transact without trace using the identity that you have chosen to use.Fundamental #8: The SAFE Network must store data in perpetuity.This is a key fundamental: it will be impossible to delete any published data from the Network after it has been uploaded. Why? Because it means that it will then be impossible to rewrite history.That doesn\u2019t mean that you won\u2019t be able to update data (for example, with new website content). You\u2019ll simply do this via \u2018append-only\u2019 changes, i.e. there will always be a permanent public trail of versions that show the changes that have been made. So in exactly the same way as the Internet Archive today stores versions of websites even if they were published with mistakes, all public/published data on the Network will be immutable and available on the Network in perpetuity.Fundamental #9: The SAFE Network will never require passwords to be on the Network or on the machines used by the Clients to access the Network.Let\u2019s start by quickly defining Clients. When you\u2019re reading about the Network, you can think of \u2018Clients\u2019 as simply meaning the software that somebody uses to access the SAFE Network.With that context, this Fundamental is all about self-authentication: the ability to sign into a decentralised autonomous network without a password leaving your computer at any point. Since it never sees your password, it can\u2019t be hacked on the Network.This is a significant step forward: instead of a futile attempt to minimise the risk of passwords getting stolen by a bad actor in their journey from machine to Network, that risk is simply removed by cutting that step out in its entirety.Fundamental #10: The SAFE Network will allow any user on any machine to access the Network and it will leave no trace of that user on that machine.This means a User isn\u2019t restricted to accessing the Network by using a specific device. Once logged out, there will be no evidence (other than say the fact that the Browser software has been downloaded) that shows what that User has done on the SAFE Network.Ultimately, any user should be able to pick up anyone\u2019s internet-connected device and use his or her credentials to access the SAFE Network regardless of location around the world.That\u2019s it for the first half of our run-through of the SAFE Network Fundamentals.

This is Chris and Hassan here from New York City at the new Cardstack Studio, which, as you can see, is totally empty. Hopefully not for much longer, but this is kind of our first week here. It\u2019s pretty exciting, and we want to give you an update of a lot of work that we\u2019ve been doing with the team that\u2019s around the world in New York, Boston, California, and in Europe.We\u2019re excited to show you not only a little demo of the code that you can play with \u2014 we\u2019ll open-source it soon \u2014 but also walk you through a bit of this minimum viable integration of the different Cardstack components into something that resembles an application.Our vision is to build essentially the platform for Web 3.0. For those of you who have been in the Cardstack community, you know that we define Web 3.0 slightly differently than other people who define Web3.With Web 1.0, pages linked together to form a true Web, and everything became hyperlinked; surfing the Web was very exciting. It was very easy to become a Web developer and build something. What ended up happening is: As the Web grew up to today\u2019s Web 2.0, with these social networks and communities, the websites got bigger and became more of a hub model, where everyone congregates around one or two websites.These websites like Facebook, Google, and Amazon apparently own a lot more than you think. And that\u2019s the Web 2.0 era, with digital superpowers really winning over the consumers, but now creating a situation where this hub and spoke model causes a lot of problems. This is the centralization problem that a lot of people in crypto and blockchain are trying to solve.We see Web 3.0 as the combination of four aspects that are concurrently coming into the world in terms of the next iteration of the Web \u2014 Web, App, Game, and Crypto.Firstly, we need to bring some of the diversity of Web 1.0, with its different websites and different styles, with the connectivity of Web 2.0. There are good design patterns and product ideas that we are incorporating.But secondly, we also have to think about Web Dev 3.0: the development structure of moving away from server side programming languages to JavaScript and API in particular, so that it runs both on your browser and sometimes on the server. That gives you a lot of flexibility to integrate data and to integrate APIs in a cohesive way, regardless of whether you\u2019re doing it as a client in the browser or on the server. We leverage a lot of Web Dev 3.0 techniques in the Cardstack stack.Thirdly, there\u2019s Web 3D, this idea of gaming. Some of the most innovative and engaged communities on the Internet are emerging within Fortnite and other games. People build up credentials, trade objects, and have their own identities and economies.Finally, crypto \u2014 Web3 \u2014 especially Ethereum, brings us the value exchange that combines these concepts in a special way, which allows fees to be paid and people to be compensated and rewarded.These four ideas combined \u2014 Web, App, Game, and Crypto \u2014 form the substrate of our Web 3.0 idea. We have worked hard to incorporate all the qualities of today\u2019s Web within the Cardstack Framework: qualities like the Web being linkable, inclusive, and referenceable; apps being functional, focused, and empowering; games being spatial, tangible, and interactive; and crypto being verifiable, transferable, and synchronized. But we want to go beyond all that, asking: What does the user see? What is the tangible object the user can interact with in Web 3.0?Part 2: Cards in ActionChris Tse: Card UI allows for individual objects \u2014 cards \u2014 to be stored, exchanged, sent as messages, turned into content, data or assets, and so on. The app is what contains these cards, which are written in HTML and JavaScript. That way, they can be easily incorporated: my card can be in your app, and your app can become a card in my app.To explain in a tangible and concrete way what cards can be, we decided to build an application that showcases them. A card is a representation of data in the ecosystem. Now, the obvious choice for some data in the crypto ecosystem to be represented is some cryptocurrency. Our demo is in Ethereum, but you can certainly use our stack to support other things as well.We\u2019ve been using a \u201ccrypto portfolio tracker\u201d to show how you can represent something for which you possess the private key and say, \u201cthis is something I posses,\u201d the same way you would with a boarding pass or a credit card.These are active assets that you might have in the Bitcoin network, other types of fork networks or privacy coin networks, and they can be organized and summarized. But each of the cards can then zoom out to give you low-level context.We thought of what you might need, other than on-chain information: You need to have exchange rates, which come from API, and you need to know the address in your wallet, which comes from another API and other data sources.We take different data that could exist on the cloud, on a device, in a personal data repository, or on the blockchain, and combine all that information. In the future, you might even tag it to additional annotations that are particularly meaningful to you.You\u2019ll be able to organize all of your information, not worrying about whether it\u2019s in a wallet in someone else\u2019s custody, in your own Trezor wallet, or in an exchange \u2014 we can summarize all your assets in one place.These cards are mobile and tactile, similar to objects in a game. You can stack them, organize them, and so on. This tactileness of cards requires a slightly different programming model.We believe this idea of embedding requires us to rethink what an app really is. Not only does a card require you to have a template and the logic in Javascript and the data model; you also need to figure out relationships, delegation, metadata access \u2014 in this case \u2014 permissions, constraints, schemas, and mapping to different data sources. To create a card, you just need these in a Github repository.If you want all these applications to be truly useful, you need to have these user experiences. And how do you synthesize all that data? That\u2019s what the Cardstack application framework is trying to do: provide not only the basic framework to build this, but also sample applications that you can compose.When the data comes from your computer, a full node on the cloud, or a Geth node, it gets synthesized into a data synthesis workflow indexing engine that is part of the Cardstack framework \u2014 and that also turns the data into new objects, which represent something that is real to you, rather than being just a bunch of hashes in the block explorer.We\u2019re going to show you an example of an app that has all these things working \u2014 running the infrastructure, synthesizing the data, tapping the consensus of the node itself, and the UI component. We call this demo app Card Folio, and it will be open-sourced very shortly. It\u2019s a combination of a blockchain explorer, a portfolio tracker, and a wallet app.If I want to know the details of an Ethereum transaction \u2014 what the gas fees were, if it succeeded, etc. \u2014 I need an Ethereum plugin to look in the full node, or even an explorer as an API to get that information. Once you have enough transactions, you can show a summary of the individual transactions. On top of that, you can inspect and introspect the smart contract and look at the balance of any currency.To keep track of all these assets, you get a list of all the addresses and networks they came from. You could also scrape a Trezor wallet (which is an upcoming feature) to find the addresses, which can then look for the assets and the transactions and synthesize the data. That\u2019s how we give you a portfolio.With exchange rates, we take the history of that transaction \u2014 when you got the ETH, when you took the ERC-20 out \u2014 and correlate it to a price feed that captures it nicely. We tell you your buy-in and buy-out, your airdrops \u2014 the total value of your portfolio, which is composed and synthesized on the top.You could run this system on the cloud, but you could also run Cardstack on your own computer, so that your entire watch list and its addresses are never leaked to anyone. That depends on whether you take a more convenient approach or you want to run it yourself.In the future, with e-banking, this same portfolio user could connect to an existing account within a financial institution. You could use the portfolio and its cards to tap into those data sources.This is how the Cardstack plugins in our Github repository will be synthesized. All this \u2014 the Ethereum plugin reflecting your ETH access, having a watch list in Git, getting a portfolio mapped to an exchange rate that allows you to log in and see information \u2014 that is what we ship and what this demo UX will show.We are using this as a way to expand the scope of not just Card Folio as a product, but also Cardstack as a framework for building these decentralized financial applications.Part 3: Code Deep DiveHassan Abdel-Rahman: Hi everyone, my name is Hassan. I\u2019m a developer here at Cardstack.Chris\u2019 challenge for us was to create an interesting, novel app using the Cardstack plugin, and I\u2019m going to show you some of those features today.This is a live app running in our staging environment. As Chris was explaining, there are a lot of different data aggregations. At the highest level, what we\u2019re looking at here is a portfolio. A portfolio contains wallets, a wallet contains assets, and these assets happen to be addresses on various crypto networks.We see both the values from individual assets being rolled up along with the various sums at each of the different levels. Here you see an Ethereum address, and this is the current value in US dollars for today. You also see one for Bitcoin, Litecoin, and ZCash. We\u2019re pulling the conversion rates for these various cryptocurrencies into US dollars live. This is all coming from CryptoCompare, so we roll that up into the overall value for the wallet itself as well as for the portfolio.What we\u2019re looking at now is the wallet, but we can separate information and look at individual currencies. We see all the Bitcoin assets, the Ethereum assets, the Litecoin assets, as well as the USD value, then we can sum that up for each different class of cryptocurrency and roll it all up.The power of this is coming from our server-side computeds \u2014 that\u2019s what\u2019s allowing us to do all the heavy lifting in terms of correlations between different data sources, and it\u2019s performing that work on the server so the client has all the baked information all ready to go, and only needs to worry about how to render that on the screen, not how to sum up currencies for each wallet.Let\u2019s take a look at this particular card, an Ethereum asset. One of the things you\u2019ll notice is that when I switch back and forth between this card, you see an embedded view and an isolated view. When a card lives within another card, it\u2019s said to be embedded into another card. We can then isolate that embedded card, and that card now takes up the full screen.In this particular Ethereum asset card, you can see the value of the asset over time at the exchange rate for that particular day. CryptoCompare has the weighted volume average daily rate, which means on midnight at GMT we take the value of the asset and create a data point for it. We see that asset fluctuate when transactions occur, we also plot those, and you\u2019ll see the transaction value at the time the transaction occurred.We can also keep track of these asset values in different currencies. This is a USD currency, and now we\u2019re looking at the Euro currency, or we can look at this in terms of BTC. When we do that we actually are changing the whole site, so now I can see everything in terms of BTC.If I want to take a look and see how everything is sliced and diced in terms of BTC, you can do that as well, as we\u2019re just using a really standard charting library here. Additionally, for each transaction we see transaction embedded cards. So I can click on a transaction and isolate that embedded transaction card, and look at the isolated transaction card.Going back to this card: it\u2019s pulling live data, so I can perform an Ethereum transaction. Well, let\u2019s do that right now \u2014 we can actually see it happen live. I have my Trezor wallet, so let\u2019s send ETH to this particular address.That transaction is being mined, and once it\u2019s done we\u2019ll have a Geth node \u2014 one of our Ethereum plugins \u2014 that we\u2019re using as one of our data sources. It\u2019s listening for new blocks, and as blocks are mined it\u2019s looking to see if a transaction occurs from the particular address that we\u2019re tracking. And if it detects one, it fires an event that says we have a new transaction, and the Cardstack Hub does its thing.It then indexes that data source with a new address for that transaction, which triggers invalidations within our index. When invalidations occur, we recompute our server-side computed so we have an asset history that is correlating the address value with the transactions for that address, as well as CryptoCompare rates for that day, and putting it all together to create a time series of the data points for that asset\u2019s value over time.We can even scroll down and see this new transaction, which looks similar to what you\u2019d see on Etherscan. We\u2019re pulling the same information that Etherscan pulls and displaying it in a slightly different way.I\u2019ve mentioned that we have many different data sources. We have a Git data source that we\u2019re using for user provided data, which in this case are the actual assets we\u2019re interested in, their addresses, the wallet, and all the addresses that are contained within the wallet, then the portfolio itself, which is an aggregation of those wallets.We could have chosen many different data sources, but we thought Git was really interesting in this particular case \u2014 especially for developers. Developers are very familiar with Git, and know it can version while keeping versioned data sources in a sophisticated way. If you want to track content and people contributing to content, Git\u2019s an awesome way of doing that, because code is a type of content.As users save information, it is saved into Git rendering it in the portfolio itself, which is associated to a user. In this manner, only I can see my portfolio and no one else.The structure we\u2019re using is called JSON:API, a fascinating format for data and expressing relationships. It\u2019s built into Ember, so it is the simplest database structure to use. We find it\u2019s very robust in terms of being able to represent relationships.You can see various assets in this wallet, one of them being the Ethereum address. Diving one level deeper, you can see the asset itself; this is an example of the Ethereum address we were just looking at as an asset. You\u2019ll notice it is not related to a user, because in Ethererum everything is global; there\u2019s nothing inherently private about an asset or an address on Ethereum. So in this case, we\u2019re just saying the asset is related to this address by virtue of its ID, and that it\u2019s related to the Ethererum network. Once we do that, we have all the information Cardstack needs to start tracking this address and listening for new events occurring on the blockchain.A lot of the features you\u2019re seeing are native to Cardstack, some of them coming from the Folio app itself. If you take a look at a Cardstack application, it is basically a mono repo. Within the mono repo are NPM modules for each of your different cards, as well as an NPM module for the application itself. For those of you familiar with Ember, this will probably look very familiar: you\u2019re looking at an Ember application with Ember add-ons, which are Ember\u2019s way of having shareable, reusable modules.Within the Ember application itself as well as within each of the cards is a folder called Cardstack. The way we\u2019re able to allow all this to work, is we have a place for all the front-end logic and a place for all the back-end logic. A card is really a vertical stack through all the layers of application. The idea is that it\u2019s all about creating useful places to provide your data and logic.The front-end parts of the cards are governed by standard Ember layout, and the back-end parts are governed by this Cardstack folder and what are called features. A feature could comprise of one of the many different types of plugins we have. We have searcher features, we have indexer features, we have middleware features, and we have authentication features. These different types of features help drive capability for your cards.We have an Ethereum data source that says where the Geth node is and what the content types are that hold fields containing addresses that we want to track. Then the data source configuration file describes a bit more about interesting computed properties that will be patched into these various Ethereum models that come out of the box when you NPM install the Cardstack Hub.We also have a CryptoCompare data source \u2014 we create a cache for each currency for that exchange rate so that we never ask for CryptoCompare more than once for any exchange rate. So this allows us to incredibly efficiently use CryptoCompare\u2019s API.Those exchange rates are then cached in the Cardstack\u2019s index. We have a synthesized data source, and this is our asset history. The asset history is where different data sources come together. In this case, we have our Ethereum and CryptoCompare data sources coming together with our Git data source, which is also describing our tracked addresses.Let\u2019s go a little bit deeper into a specific card: the asset card. You\u2019ll remember the asset card has both an isolated view, which was the full screen view, and an embedded view. We have templates for the the embedded view of the asset as well as for the isolated view.Ember Animated picks out the interesting parts of each of these templates, then animates them for us so we don\u2019t have to write any code. Going down into the actual Cardstack features, what we see here is static-model type of feature where we\u2019re able to describe the schema for a card.These are the different fields that comprise an asset. For this field, we have today\u2019s rates as a computed field, which is coming from the intersection of information that\u2019s in Git as well as the information that\u2019s in CryptoCompare.Computeds are the part of Cardstack where the different data sources intersect, and the correlations between different data sources occurs. We have various computed fields that we define here as part of our schema, then we have various grants.These are the permissions that are available. Assets aren\u2019t too exciting in terms of grants \u2014 anyone can see an asset, because assets aren\u2019t inherently private to a particular person since they are available on the blockchain.It\u2019s an interesting system that allows you to integrate disparate data sources quickly (once you have established a schema that describes your data source) then relates them to external data sources.So that\u2019s a quick dive through our code. We\u2019ll be publishing guides as the weeks go on, so that people can get their hands dirty and take these cards apart in great detail then describe how to assemble themPart 4: What\u2019s NextChris Tse: This Card Folio application is basically \u201cHello World\u201d for Cardstack \u2014 it\u2019s one of the simplest applications that leverages all our architecture.For those of you who aren\u2019t developers, the way I would describe the data system we\u2019re using to assemble this stuff is like Excel. Sheet 1 is all your external data; Sheet 2 is configuration data; Sheet 3 is manual entry content, and Sheet 4 combines them all to create a unified view. As you know in Excel, if you add a row or change a number, everything else auto updates. We\u2019ve taken the same ideas of change propogation and computations and related formulas and linked content.Instead of having you download the file in .csv, it\u2019s continuous through our plugin system that listens to the blockchain, cloud APIs, and interrogating Git repositories, then asynchronously propagates (what we call event sourcing). You might say, \u201cI\u2019ve seen Etherscan. I\u2019ve seen MyEtherWallet. I\u2019ve seen all these wallets.\u201d But with what we have done is made it so you can now build on a data infrastructure. The Ethereum plugin shows ETH assets with a watch list and an exchange rate, with a portfolio belonging to a user.Because of the composability of the card system, we\u2019ll be able to support Bitcoin and ERC-20 assets with different plugins, ways of indexing. We can get a list of addresses not just from Git, but from a hosted wallet or a service, or we could get it from your hardware wallet.The user doesn\u2019t have to learn 10 new tools or log into 16 websites because this new ERC-20 token or this other smart contract platform has its own explorer and you have to relearn those skills. We want them to choose Cardstack as the programming framework, to use this kind of Easy Bake situation where they can just take the code that we have put together.We see this as not just about building a portfolio system, but as a basis for a product suite that we can collaborate on as a community. We can use these five cards as the foundation to build an open, decentralized finance suite. Since it\u2019s built on the Cardstack Framework, it shares a lot of the plugin capability that we\u2019ve already built. It\u2019s open core, so all the core code that does the introspection, ingestion and indexing is built in.The part that\u2019s in staging right now will be live for the community to play with on card.space, which is our kitchen sink playpen for Cardstack applications.What you can see here is that we can go beyond just dealing with this static view of looking at the explorer and portfolio tracker and going into workflow. I want to send a million dollars worth of Bitcoin. Maybe the person helping you store the wallet say, \u201cHey, that seems like a lot of value, why don\u2019t we go through a multisig process. Let\u2019s do some identity verification. Let\u2019s go through a workflow and have that.\u201d Let\u2019s say you want to perform an action and trade this.We use this suite so your card could now carrying the information and configuration with its Git-JSON to a trading firm that takes that information as an input without any transcription. A workflow, checklist, approval, trading, or rating could be added in the same compositional way that allows Cardstack cardflow to satisfy three or four different categories of crypto applications. It\u2019s more like a real application suite, and that\u2019s the power of Cardstack.I want people to remember that every ecosystem, whether it\u2019s the financial ecosystem, the media ecosystem, a software ecosystem, requires people to get on-ramped. They need to have a way to get into the network. Currently, the way to participate in crypto requires a Trezor wallet, a MetaMask, or something like that, and that\u2019s a very flimsy and futzy way of having key management, and desktop app, and Electron app, and Mac app, and iOS app mixed together.We believe the node to onramp could be a website you run for yourself on your own cloud, a website someone runs for you, or a website that runs on your computer. We want people to see Cardstack as that node \u2014 we are a client to the blockchain, but a server to your application.It has a URL you can reference, so whether you\u2019re an institution or consumer or marketplace, you use Cardstack as your onramp and through the Cardstack synthesis in the Hub you can then access all these objects in the Web 3.0 space that might be on different nodes.Inside a Cardstack node are plugins that tap into both blockchain and the cloud, so when data comes in from the blockchain, it goes through the blockchain node, we cache it, we notify another system, we update the database that creates a composite data model, then it goes into a friendly API and your Web app displays it.Most application frameworks have trouble writing things in the right place; if you make changes it\u2019s unclear if it goes to a blockchain or a data store, etc. We have the infrastructure that knows if you\u2019re trying to modify something on the Ethereum network, or your trying to modify something that will go into the enterprise databases.This is unlike a lot of the Web application frameworks that developers are familiar with. This architecture allows the blockchain and the cloud to come together, but built in a plugin way.Once we have these layers \u2014 the event sourcing, data model, and REST API \u2014 we\u2019re able to use Docker to support plugins and an NPM to distribute the onramps. When you build ecosystems, you could choose Cardstack as your standard app server and skip over 75% of the work that would get you to the starting point Cardstack provides. All you\u2019d have to do to start is declare your object, declare your template, then ship.Our slogan is Experience Web 3.0, and I hope this demo showed you a glimpse of that. It always seems a little ironic that we can\u2019t really show most of the work that\u2019s gone into Cardstack \u2014 we have some internal test applications, but it\u2019s really hard to show what\u2019s actually going on in this Web 3.0 world. But I think Card Folio will be a great way for us to continue to demonstrate the capability of the Cardstack Framework in a way that is concrete to users.This is very early in the application phase of the Cardstack infrastructure, and we\u2019re going to soon have tutorials, demos and new applications that demonstrate the capabilities of the Framework, the Hub, and the plugins.Years of work that have accumulated to us being able to do this stuff. But Web 3.0 is one of those things that will be built by the community. It\u2019s not going to be built by our team or another team in crypto.We want people to share tools, resources and practices. We belong to the open source community, and certainly, we are also part of the crypto world. We know how challenging it is to build for Ethereum, and hopefully with the type of layers and developer ergonomics that come with building these abstractions we can accelerate a progress so we can see Web 3.0 much sooner than another lifetime.Everyone is worried Facebook, Google, and Amazon are going to buy every tech company under the sun and centralize. The quest of providing decentralized alternatives to the centralized superpowers is more urgent and important than ever. And hopefully today, and as we move forward, we\u2019re taking steps closer to providing that alternative.To see our next community software demo, be sure to join our Discord channel.Learn MoreCloud Apps Are Like Coat Checks by Chris TseWe\u2019re Thinking Big in 2019How the Cardstack Framework Powers Decentralized ApplicationsThe Cardstack White Paperhttps://cardstack.com/", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Open Source", "Decentralization", "Features", "Web3"]}, {"title": "Application of Waves Smart Accounts and Smart Assets for Financial Instruments", "post_link": "https://blog.wavesplatform.com/application-of-waves-smart-accounts-and-smart-assets-for-financial-instruments-813a993b78e9?source=search_post", "author_name": "Waves Platform", "author_link": "https://blog.wavesplatform.com/@wavesplatform", "publish_date": "2019-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2019-03-15", "readtime": "8.78", "claps": 233, "voters": 19, "content": "Application of Waves Smart Accounts and Smart Assets for Financial InstrumentsWaves PlatformFollowMar 15 \u00b7 9 min readIn the previous article, we considered several use cases for smart accounts in business, including auctions and customer loyalty programs.Today, we will discuss how smart accounts and smart assets could improve the transparency and reliability of financial instruments such as options, futures and bills of exchange.OptionsAn option is a contract that gives the buyer the right but not the obligation to buy an asset at a specified price, prior to or on a certain date.An option can be implemented in the following way. We use a smart asset for an option and a smart account for a participant who takes the role of an exchange and issues options (\u201cexchange\u201d participant). The \u201cexchange\u201d participant pledges to sell a certain amount of an asset at sellPrice between block heights expirationStart and expirationEnd.In the smart asset\u2019s code, we just need to check that it trades only between the set heights, while responsibility for observing the rules will be delegated to the \u201cexchange\u201d participant\u2019s code.Smart asset code:let expirationStart = 100000let expirationEnd = 101440match tx {case some : ExchangeTransaction | TransferTransaction =>height > expirationStart && height <= expirationEndcase _ => false}We\u2019ll assume that the following actions will take place: the \u201cexchange\u201d participant sells options for buying a certain asset, and the other participants can send or trade these options. To execute their right to buy the asset, a potential buyer has to transfer a corresponding number of options to the buyer\u2019s account \u2014 i.e. to the account of the \u201cexchange\u201d participant.Subsequently, the buyer adds the information on the transfer to the account\u2019s state, and only after that can an ExchangeTransaction with specified conditions for buying/selling be accepted by the blockchain.In the smart account code, we need to check that any ExchangeTransaction going through it for the final deal corresponds to the set conditions and the buyer purchases only the same number of units they sent to the account of the \u201cexchange\u201d participant.The buyer needs to send a correct DataTransaction with the transfer, so that the \u201cexchange\u201d participant can avoid double spending. In this DataTransaction, the buyer adds to the key, which corresponds to their address, a value that is equal to the number of options transferred to the account of the \u201cexchange\u201d participant, i.e. equal to the number of units of the asset they can buy.Smart account code:#the account owner pledges to sell a certain number of the asset's units#at sellPrice between block heights expirationStart and expirationEndlet expirationStart = 100000let expirationEnd = 101440let sellPrice = 10000let amountAsset = base58'8jfD2JBLe23XtCCSQoTx5eAW5QCU6Mbxi3r78aNQLcNf'let priceAsset = base58'9jfD2JBLe23XtCCSQoTx5eAW5QCU6Mbxi3r78aNQLcNf'#option asset IDlet optionsAsset = base58'7jfD2JBLe23XtCCSQoTx5eAW5QCU6Mbxi3r78aNQLcNf'#extracting the sender's address from the transactionlet this = tx.sendermatch tx {case dataTx : DataTransaction =>#extracting the number of units from the DataTransaction by the key (user ID)let units = extract(getInteger(dataTx.data, dataTx.data[0].key))#extracting the transaction from the prooflet e = transactionById(o.proofs[7])match e {case exchangeTx : ExchangeTransaction =>let correctSeller = exchangeTx.sellOrder.sender == Boblet correctBuyer = exchangeTx.buyOrder.sender == Alicelet correctAssetPair = (exchangeTx.sellOrder.assetPair.amountAsset == amountAsset && exchangeTx.sellOrder.amount == sellAmount && exchangeTx.sellOrder.price == sellPrice)|| (exchangeTx.buyOrder.assetPair.amountAsset == amountAsset && exchangeTx.buyOrder.amount == sellAmount && exchangeTx.buyOrder.price == sellPrice)#making sure that the order\u2019s ID is correctly stated in the proof transactionlet correctProof = extract(getBinary(extract(tx.sender), toBase58String(exchangeTx.sellOrder.id))) == o.id|| extract(getBinary(extract(tx.sender), toBase58String(exchangeTx.buyOrder.id))) == o.idcorrectAssetPair && correctProof && correctSeller && correctBuyercase _ => false} &&(height >= expiration) &&#verifying the signature(sigVerify(tx.bodyBytes, tx.proofs[0], tx.senderPublicKey)) &&(tx.sender == Bob)case _ => false}Futures contractsUnlike options, futures contracts (futures) represent the buyer\u2019s obligation to buy an asset at a predetermined price at a specified time in the future, not merely the opportunity to do so.Overall, the implementation of futures is similar to that of options. Here, a smart asset acts as the futures.We also need to check that both buyer and seller sign a transaction order. A futures contract is an obligation that has to be executed in any case. So, if the buyer or seller repudiate their obligations, any participant in the network can send a transaction and thereby execute the contract.The smart asset\u2019s script controls all TransferTransactions and ExchangeTransactions of the futures assets, approving them only if the buyer has created an order for a future purchase of the future assets from the \u201cexchange\u201d participant.This order has to be valid and meet the conditions under which the futures contract was issued. To check the order, all of its fields could be recorded to the buyer\u2019s account\u2019s state along with the byte code of the signed order, after which validation by a third party could be carried out.Currently, RIDE doesn\u2019t contain a native feature for parsing transaction bytes, but has all the necessary tools for its implementation. Developers could therefore try to implement that feature by themselves.Multi-signature accounts / EscrowA multi-signature account allows several users to jointly manage assets (for instance, transactions with assets could only be allowed if signed by three users out of four). To create multi-signature accounts with RIDE, we can use transaction proofs.A multi-signature account could also be used for an escrow account, in which funds are held until transacting parties have satisfied their contractual obligations.let alicePubKey  = base58'5AzfA9UfpWVYiwFwvdr77k6LWupSTGLb14b24oVdEpMM'let bobPubKey    = base58'2KwU4vzdgPmKyf7q354H9kSyX9NZjNiq4qbnH2wi2VDF'let cooperPubKey = base58'GbrUeGaBfmyFJjSQb9Z8uTCej5GzjXfRDVGJGrmgt5cD'#checking who provided correct signatureslet aliceSigned  = if(sigVerify(tx.bodyBytes, tx.proofs[0], alicePubKey)) then 1 else 0let bobSigned    = if(sigVerify(tx.bodyBytes, tx.proofs[1], bobPubKey)) then 1 else 0let cooperSigned = if(sigVerify(tx.bodyBytes, tx.proofs[2], cooperPubKey)) then 1 else 0#adding all correct signatures and checking their numberaliceSigned + bobSigned + cooperSigned >= 2Token curated registry (TCR)Many blockchain platforms face the problem of toxic assets. For instance, on Waves Platform, any address that has paid the issuance fee can create an asset.One way to approach the toxic asset issue is with a token curated registry (TCR), generated by token holders.To vote to add a specific token to the list, holders place a stake corresponding to their share in the total number of issued tokens. A token is added to the registry if the majority of its holders vote for it.In our example, a user is allowed to add a token to the consideration list (during the \u201cchallenge\u201d period) by the state key = asset_name solely if the current value of the count = 0.Also, the user has to have an non-zero balance of the token in question in their wallet. Then, during the voting period, the user can vote for each asset in their wallet, but just once, rating them on a scale from 1 to 10. Users\u2019 votes are represented by keys that look like this: user_address+assetID.let asset = base58'8jfD2JBLe23XtCCSQoTx5eAW5QCU6Mbxi3r78aNQLcNf'let addingStartHeight = 1000let votingStartHeight = 2000let votingEndHeight = 3000#extracting the sender\u2019s address from the transactionlet this = extract(tx.sender)#extracting the address from the transaction\u2019s prooflet address = addressFromPublicKey(tx.proofs[1])match tx {case t: DataTransaction =>if(height > addingStartHeight)then(if(height < votingStartHeight)then(#adding#checking if this address has this assetlet hasTokens = assetBalance(address, asset) > 0size(t.data) == 1#making sure this assets has not yet been added&& !isDefined(getInteger(this, toBase58String(asset)))#checking if 0 has been added by the asset key&& extract(getInteger(t.data, toBase58String(asset))) == 0&& hasTokens)else(if(height < votingEndHeight)then(#voting#finding out the current number of votes for this asset and the base numberlet currentAmount = extract(getInteger(this, toBase58String(asset)))let newAmount = extract(getInteger(t.data, toBase58String(asset)))let betString = toBase58String(address.bytes) + toBase58String(asset)#checking that this address has not yet voted for this assetlet noBetBefore = !isDefined(getInteger(this, betString))let isBetCorrect = extract(getInteger(t.data, betString)) > 0&& extract(getInteger(t.data, betString)) <= 10#checking if the voter has enough tokenslet hasTokens = assetBalance(address, asset) > 0#checking that the transaction is defined correctlysize(t.data) == 2 && isDefined(getInteger(this, toBase58String(asset)))&& newAmount == currentAmount + 1&& noBetBefore && isBetCorrect && hasTokens)else false) && sigVerify(tx.bodyBytes, tx.proofs[0], tx.proofs[1]))else falsecase _ => false}Subscription feeIn this example, we look at using smart accounts for executing a \u201csubscription fee\u201d \u2014 regular payments for goods or services in a set time frame.If a user sends to a smart account (through transaction proofs) an ID TransferTransaction with a required amount of transferred funds, they could add to the account state: {key: address, value: true}.This would mean that that the user confirms a subscription for goods or services. When the subscription period expires, any user in the network could change that value to false.let subscriptionPeriod = 44000let signature = tx.proofs[0]let pk = tx.proofs[1]let requiredAmount = 100000#extracting the sender\u2019s address from the transactionlet this = extract(tx.sender)match tx {case d: DataTransaction =>#extracting the date of the most recent paymentlet lastPaymentHeight = extract(getInteger(this, d.data[0].key + \"_lastPayment\"))size(d.data) == 1 && d.data[0].value == \"false\" && lastPaymentHeight + subscriptionPeriod < height||(let address = d.data[0].key#extracting the transfer transaction by the ID indicated in the proofs.let ttx = transactionById(d.proofs[0])size(d.data) == 2&& d.data[0].value == \"true\"&& d.data[1].key == address + \"_lastPayment\"&& match ttx {case purchase : TransferTransaction =>d.data[1].value == transactionHeightById(purchase.id)&& toBase58String(purchase.sender.bytes) == address&& purchase.amount == requiredAmount&& purchase.recipient == this#making sure the asset is WAVES&& !isDefined(purchase.assetId)case _ => false})case _ => false}VotingSmart accounts could be used for implementing voting on the blockchain. One example is voting for the best ambassador\u2019s report in an ambassador program. The account state is used as a platform to record votes for various options.In this example, only those who have purchased \u201cvoting\u201d tokens can vote. A user sends a DataTransaction with (key, value) = (purchaseTransactionId, buyTransactionId). Other values for this key are not allowed. Using their address and voting option, a DataEntry can be done only once. Voting is allowed only within a specified period.let asset = base58'8jfD2JBLe23XtCCSQoTx5eAW5QCU6Mbxi3r78aNQLcNf'let address = addressFromPublicKey(tx.proofs[1])let votingStartHeight = 2000let votingEndHeight = 3000#extracting the sender\u2019s address from the transactionlet this = extract(tx.sender)match tx {case t: DataTransaction =>(height > votingStartHeight && height < votingEndHeight) &&#verifying that the signature of the transaction is correctsigVerify(tx.bodyBytes, tx.proofs[0], tx.proofs[1]) &&#verifying that the user puts his vote next to his addressif (t.data[0].key == toBase58String(address.bytes))then (#extracting the transaction for transfer of a voting token from the prooflet purchaseTx = transactionById(t.proofs[7])match purchaseTx {case purchase : TransferTransaction =>let correctSender = purchase.sender == t.senderlet correctAsset = purchase.assetId == assetlet correctPrice = purchase.amount == 1let correctProof = extract(getBinary(this, toBase58String(purchase.id))) == t.idcorrectSender && correctAsset && correctPrice && correctProofcase _ => false})elsesize(t.data) == 1 && !isDefined(getBinary(this, t.data[0].key))case _ => false}Bill of exchangeA bill of exchange is a written order under which one party is obliged to pay a fixed sum of money to another party on demand or at a predetermined date.In our example, a smart account is used, the expiration date of which corresponds to the payment date of the bill of exchange.let expiration = 100000let amount = 10let asset =  base58'9jfD2JBLe23XtCCSQoTx5eAW5QCU6Mbxi3r78aNQLcNf'let Bob = Address(base58'3NBVqYXrapgJP9atQccdBPAgJPwHDKkh6A8')let Alice = Address(base58'3PNX6XwMeEXaaP1rf5MCk8weYeF7z2vJZBg')match tx {case t: TransferTransaction =>(t.assetId == asset)&&(t.amount == amount)&&(t.sender == Bob)&&(t.recipient == Alice)&&(sigVerify(t.bodyBytes, t.proofs[0], t.senderPublicKey))&&(height >= expiration)case _ => false}DepositA deposit is the placement of funds at a bank under certain conditions (duration, interest rate). In our example, a smart account acts as a bank. After reaching a certain block height, which corresponds to the period of the deposit, a user can have their cash repaid with interest. In the script, a block height is set, after which the user can withdraw the deposited amount (finalHeight).heightUnit is the number of blocks in one period unit (such as a month or a year). Initially, we check the presence of a record with the pair (key, value) = (initialTransferTransaction, futureDataTransaction). Then, the user has to send a TransferTransaction with correct information on the deposited sum and interest collected over the deposit period. This information is checked against the initial TransferTransaction, which is contained in the current proof of the TransferTransaction. depositDivisor is the inverse of the deposit share (if the deposit is placed at a 10% interest, the share is 0.1 and depositDevisor equals 1/0.1 = 10).let this = extract(tx.sender)let depositDivisor = 10let heightUnit = 1000let finalHeight = 100000match tx {case e : TransferTransaction =>#extracting the height of the transaction by the transaction ID, which is in the seventh prooflet depositHeight = extract(transactionHeightById(e.proofs[7]))#extracting the deposit transactionlet purchaseTx = transactionById(e.proofs[7])match purchaseTx {case deposit : TransferTransaction =>let correctSender = deposit.sender == e.sender#checking that the user transfers to himself the correct sum of the deposit and the interestlet correctAmount = deposit.amount + deposit.amount / depositDivisor * (height - depositHeight) / heightUnit == e.amountlet correctProof = extract(getBinary(this, toBase58String(deposit.id))) == e.idcorrectSender && correctProof && correctAmountcase _ => false}&& finalHeight <= heightcase _ => sigVerify(tx.bodyBytes, tx.proofs[0], tx.senderPublicKey)}In the third and final article in this series, we will look at some specific use cases for smart assets, including asset freezing and restricting transactions for specific addresses.Join Waves CommunityRead Waves News channelFollow Waves TwitterSubscribe to Waves Subreddit", "responses": 1, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Smart Contracts", "Web3", "Blockchain Technology", "Blockchain Programming"]}, {"title": "Scatter & nOS \u2014 Introducing Ethereum, EOS, and TRON apps to nOS", "post_link": "https://medium.com/nos-io/scatter-nos-introducing-ethereum-eos-and-tron-apps-to-nos-6a7e6bb5f7dc?source=search_post", "author_name": "Dean van Dugteren", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@deanpress", "publish_date": "2019-03-13", "last_modified_date": "2019-03-13", "readtime": "3.22", "claps": 483, "voters": 20, "content": "Scatter & nOS \u2014 Introducing Ethereum, EOS, and TRON apps to nOSWe\u2019re expanding the nOS ecosystem!

What if an app tries to steal your funds?Blockchain-powered apps introduce a new sense of responsibility to the user. After all, these apps may interact with your tokens and cryptocurrencies, and if you\u2019re not careful enough, you risk losing funds.By integrating Scatter\u2019s RIDL token with nOS (and vice-versa), users can easily verify if any nOS website, dApp, or smart contract is deemed trustworthy or not before interacting with it.Tooling and DocumentationNext to these technical integrations, we will also work with Scatter on new tools, starter kits, and developer documentation:nOS will include documentation on building applications with Scatter.Scatter will include documentation on deploying ScatterApps to nOS.nOS and Scatter will build a CLI-wizard that generates starter kits for Scatter apps, paired with a one-line command to deploy the application to the nOS ecosystem.By working together on both a strategic and technological level, we can boost both developer and end-user adoption for ScatterApps.Together we\u2019re building the solutions that connect users to dApps in a way that has not been seen before: simple and smooth.Follow nOSNewsletterTwitterDiscordMediumTelegram AnnouncementsTelegram CommunityFollow Dean van DugterenTwitterMedium", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Ethereum", "Eos", "Tron", "Web3"]}, {"title": "Analyzing the use of distributed ledgers for micro-mobility", "post_link": "https://medium.com/helbizofficial/analyzing-the-use-of-distributed-ledgers-for-micro-mobility-11617ceb05fa?source=search_post", "author_name": "Carlos Beltran", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@carlosbeltran", "publish_date": "2019-03-08", "last_modified_date": "2019-03-08", "readtime": "5.45", "claps": 176, "voters": 10, "content": "Analyzing the use of distributed ledgers for micro-mobilityCarlos BeltranFollowMar 8 \u00b7 6 min readPhoto by Joshua Rawson-Harris on UnsplashThe challenge of having quickly-verifiable transactions with a level of data privacy represents an opportunity for DLT platforms to become the de-facto solution for the emerging micro-mobility sector.Industry leaders have taken note of the potential of blockchain technology, especially in the automotive and mobility industry. Head of blockchain and distributed ledger technologies at BMW Group, Andre Luckow explains how blockchain can make it possible for consumers to take control of their data. The articles also mentions the potential for the technology when applied to the rapid growth of mobility services and the sheer number of interconnected vehicles and sensors we will have in the near future.There are a number of applications of blockchain technology in this space. To name a few:Digital identity and data ownershipVerifiable vehicle historyUsage-based insuranceOne idea in particular being explored by Helbiz is an open data marketplace \u2014 where users of services maintain ownership of the data they produce and are able to monetize it.Any data produced by a person using the service is managed at the wallet level, only being shared with the rest of the network when the owner decides to. In this paradigm, users only grant access to their data to specific applications only when it is required or incentivized. Having this data available at scale would create marketplaces where, for example, anyone interested in knowing how many scooters were rented over the holidays between two city landmarks can purchase the relevant datasets and have the payments be automatically routed to the data contributors. Payments, the reference of data, and the automatic routing of micro-payments would be managed in a decentralized fashion. The exact mechanics of this can be thought up in a myriad of ways, but it would be fundamentally different from the client-server model of Web 2.0.From Web 2.0 to web3The term Web 2.0 was coined in 2004 to describe the second version of the internet, one where content was user-generated and websites were more dynamic than ever. However, this stage in its evolution gave rise to the tech companies that currently dominate the landscape. Some act as gateways and facilitators to the internet (Apple, Microsoft), while others provide services in exchange for data (Google, Facebook).The explosion of activity in the blockchain space has given prominence to the term web3 which was coined by Gavin Wood, former CTO of Ethereum. It represents a monumental paradigm shift, replacing centralized applications with peer-to-peer networks and decentralized protocols. Every facet of web applications will be designed to manage data in such a way that makes it difficult for bad actors to participate. That being said, this goal of reshaping the infrastructure of the web comes with a large challenge of privacy \u2014 not compromising sensitive information in an environment of transparent transactions.Decentralized data storesTo support the paradigm of web3, existing cloud architectures must use some sort of distributed ledger technology (DLT) to structure the data such that it is difficult to alter after-the-fact, while still having it available for different parties with varying levels of access. If we are to use the Ethereum smart contract model where all data stored on-chain is publicly available, we would need a way to store certain data publicly for immutability, while obfuscating some of the more sensitive and identifiable parts.Ethereum is often described as a world computer, one with a global state that allows an arbitrary number of instructions to run on it. Using it as a database is very expensive, and although reading from the blockchain is free, updating its state is not. The larger the records being saved and the more storage is used, the more expensive the transactions are. Running intensive calculations on-chain are also not feasible. This is why using blockchains such as Ethereum as a data store is extremely inefficient when compared to current cloud services.Moreover, token models simply don\u2019t work for all real-world business problems; they are not a one-size-fits-all solution. While an ERC-721 is good representing a set of baseball cards or a digital asset in a game, it does not for an item in a supply chain where data is being accumulated and its ownership is continuously being transferred \u2014 all of which would require state updates. The same logic applies when managing user-generated and user-owned data that can eventually be exposed to interested parties.IPFS offers decentralization as any data stored is distributed amongst nodes in the network. Files are not addressable by location (domain/IP-based) but by the cryptographic hash generated from their content. This makes the content tamper-proof as it would change the hash. Once a file is propagated by the network, anyone can access it using an IPFS client or public gateway. The problem with this solution is that the content of the files is publicly available, as long as the hash is known. The only way to mitigate this is to encrypt the file before uploading it, and share the private key with whomever needs to decrypt the file. Using this method of storage for sensitive information and the subsequent transfer of it is sure to have its set of problems when done at scale.Any developers interested in seeing how data storage can be achieved using Ethereum and IPFS should check out this github repository.Currently, many DLT projects are not mature enough to handle production usage. Some are good at some things, others not so much. It\u2019s easy to envision a future where different technologies are used for different applications. Bitcoin can eventually be used as a store of value. Ethereum has paved the way for technology labeling itself decentralized finance. However, we have yet to declare a leading DLT solution for the Internet of Things (IoT) and the open data marketplaces that are guaranteed to follow. There are unique problems when dealing with interconnected devices, and perhaps it\u2019s a combination of solutions that will be used in this emerging sector. If we track interactions between devices and human-generated events in an immutable and transparent fashion, the solution must be lightweight enough to circumvent problems related to connectivity, bandwidth, and low-power resources.Alternative DLT projectsIn the context of IoT and blockchain, the project with the most headspace is arguably IOTA. What stands out about their proposition is the use of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) they call the \u201cTangle\u201d. With this data structure they claim a highly scalable network, where transactions are transparent but are able to hold encrypted data. However, the project has been criticized for lacking technical judgement, and the general performance of the Tangle has yet to be proven. In fact, a recent post of theirs discusses their new testnet which does not have a validator to verify whether transactions are valid or not.Tupelo is a new DLT project by Quorum Control, with a different data structure of nodes being organized into what they call \u201cchain trees\u201d. This is fundamentally different from having blocks organized as a linked list because now each asset can be its own branch with its own set of transactions. This allows for a more efficient transfer of ownership rights for unique assets and data because it only requires verification of relevant transaction history. The network makes use of a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus algorithm for resolving conflict sets, using a native utility token called Tuple for rewards, staking, and general payments. Although their technology hasn\u2019t been used in production, they differentiate themselves from Ethereum and Hyperledger in that their solution is novel and built for individual objects, featuring a cheaper consensus algorithm (modeled at $0.0008 per transaction) with faster transactions and offline capabilities.Mainstream blockchain technology in its current state might not be able support the wide variety of applications for the mobility sector. There are large-scale efforts to bring Ethereum closer to production via Layer 2 scaling solutions, but it remains to be seen whether they will be ready in time to keep developers on the platform. The challenge of having quickly-verifiable transactions with a level of data privacy represents an opportunity for DLT platforms to become the de-facto solution for the emerging micro-mobility sector.", "responses": 2, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Mobility", "Web3", "Distributed Ledgers"]}, {"title": "Enabling ownership for all.

Neufund\u2019s new brandingNeufundFollowOct 31, 2018 \u00b7 6 min readToday, after months of extensive work, Neufund changes its branding. Let\u2019s make ownership transparent, accessible and efficient.Evolution of financial servicesOwnership at its core is something very simple \u2014 \u201can act, state, or right of possessing something\u201d. No matter what you own, you should have full control over it.However, with the advent of the financial services industry a complex system of regulation was introduced, replacing a simple concept with complex ecosystem, consisting of multiple middlemen. The result is a heavy and inefficient system, especially around assets like equity, real estate or financial instruments. You want to buy a stock? You have to go to a broker. You want to safely deposit your money? You go to a bank to which you transfer the rights to control over your capital.If you want to trade on Wall Street you are dependent on an array of services spanning from central depositories, to custodian, brokers and clearing houses. Systems that require so many different intermediaries have a number of disadvantages. Take information asymmetry as an example, it is a cumbersome process to distribute information between several parties which is also costly, leaving space for corruption and misuse along the way. It creates a paradox, as the original role of each and every one of these middlemen was to protect the investors and make the system more efficient.Blockchain eliminates the need for the middlemen, making the ecosystem more effective and transparent. Suddenly, you no longer need the intermediary\u2019s services, as those are provided by the network itself. As a result, the system is cheaper to use, thus more accessible to anyone.Blockchain allows us to bring ownership back to its roots. And this is exactly what we\u2019re doing at Neufund.Enabling ownership for allAt Neufund, we believe that ownership should be more efficient, accessible and transparent. We don\u2019t aim at reinventing it we only provide the environment where ownership can be managed easily and efficiently. This is what our new claim stands for.Tokenization of assets carries a lot of promises: increased liquidity means you will always be able to offer what you own to a global pool of investors across multiple secondary exchanges, programmability allows assets to include self-executing utility functions, and fractional ownership lowers barriers of entrance for retail investors.Neufund is an end-to-end asset tokenization and issuance ecosystem, consisting out of a set of protocols for enhanced ownership, The Neufund Platform serving as user-friendly interface, connecting investors with issuers and our legal architecture which ensures the safety and compliance of the whole process. We serve both, as a technology and legal infrastructure provider, as well as a primary market for issuance.Read more about Neufund\u2019s mission \u2192Our new websiteHomepageAlong with the claim, we are very proud to present you our new website, the direct effect of our cross disciplinary efforts.

For clarity, the phrase \u2018Hop 1\u2019 here means the data transfer directly after that connection to the first SAFE Network node (not the hop that may take place from your computer to your home WiFi router, for example).Fundamental #12: The SAFE Network will only accept more Vaults when it needs them.The Network will balance supply and demand without relying on external controls (such as a committee choosing who can take part and when). Like any species or group of organisms, unbounded growth leads to its demise. The SAFE Network could be attacked by a bad actor adding millions of nodes: perhaps it closes them down suddenly or maybe it attempts to use malicious nodes in order to bring the Network to a halt. To help prevent this, the Network will only allow new nodes to join when it needs the extra resource. This slows down attackers, diluting their influence with the good actors who are also trying to join.Fundamental #13: The Network autonomously increases farming rewards when it needs more resources (i.e. Vaults) and decreases rewards when resources are plentiful.This is crucial functionality for a system that is autonomous and manages itself without the intervention of any third parties. If the Network simply accepted every Vault immediately, it would likely be targeted by a botnet attack or an attacker trying to set up an overwhelming number of malicious nodes in the early days of the Network.This is why the incentivisation mechanics are crucial: with Safecoin, the Network must be able to balance the supply of Vaults. This avoids a Network with a large number of nodes with very little data (which would then push the farming, i.e. reward, rates down).Fundamental #14: The #SAFENetwork ranks nodes over time and increase trust in higher ranked nodes.One of the ways in which the Network defends itself from attack is by choosing to permit only the most trustworthy nodes within each of the Close Groups to vote on the Network decisions. This is known as Node Ageing, when only the most trustworthy nodes with a history of following the rules and requirements of the Network are allowed to vote, which means malicious behaviour is prevented dynamically = no third parties required.Fundamental #15: The SAFE Network will never use servers.The SAFE Network will never rely on servers because they represent a weakness that would undermine the entire Network. Servers represent the opportunity for someone \u2014 or a group of people \u2014 to control everyone else on the Network.Fundamental #16: The Network will digitally sign all transactions to make sure that the transactions have been authorised in accordance with the rules of the Network.A Network that requires all transactions to have been signed digitally is one that can ensure that all transactions have been carried out according to the rules of the Network.Fundamental #17: All messages sent directly between Clients will be free on the Network. If those messages need to travel across the SAFE Network more indirectly, the Network will charge.Direct Client-to-Client messages (remember: Client just means the software that lets the User access SAFE) will be free but those that involve other parts of the Network and the Clearnet will incur a cost to enable the Network to cover the costs of that travel.Fundamental #18: The SAFE Network will never use time as a network tool (although nodes may use local durations).If SAFE used the concept of time, it would mean that Network nodes would have to connect to centralised third party servers or services in order to synchronise times \u2014 and you already know third parties don\u2019t exist on the SAFE Network. Instead the Network is event-driven: it responds to the actions of users.This is very similar to nature where systems will respond to the events and actions that take place. An example of this on SAFE is within our consensus algorithm #PARSEC which is also not driven by time.Fundamental #19: The SAFE Network will only ever allow encrypted traffic and encrypted services.Put simply, everything, including web traffic is encrypted by default. Everything. This is non-negotiable for a Network that demands privacy for every one of its users. You can of course choose to make information public \u2014 but this has to be your choice alone. So this means you can be safe in the knowledge your data will always be secure.Fundamental #20: The Network will allow real-time upgrades in a secure manner. The Network will refuse to implement any upgrades that might break it.The Network be able to upgrade its software without disruption. It must be able to validate each suggested improvement by checking the new proposed software against the current software and accept the change only if can see that it brings improved performance. Why is this so important? Because a network is a living organism and in order to work efficiently, iterative changes have to be possible.So there we go. All 20 Fundamentals. Each decision, thought, idea and piece of code is tied to at least one Fundamental. They govern everything we do. And these principles will stay with us as we continue to build and grow the SAFE Network.You can also listen to the man himself, David Irvine, founder and CEO of Maidsafe, discuss these at length on the SAFE CrossRoads podcast here", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Safenetwork", "Web3"]}, {"title": "Node 1.0 Released on Mainnet", "post_link": "https://blog.wavesplatform.com/node-1-0-released-on-mainnet-18baa28972e1?source=search_post", "author_name": "Waves Platform", "author_link": "https://blog.wavesplatform.com/@wavesplatform", "publish_date": "2019-06-25", "last_modified_date": "2019-06-25", "readtime": "2.57", "claps": 234, "voters": 18, "content": "Node 1.0 Released on MainnetWaves PlatformFollowJun 25 \u00b7 3 min readWe are releasing a major update for the Waves blockchain! Waves Node 1.0 will bring some powerful and long-awaited new functionality and features to the Waves ecosystem.With Node 1.0, Waves receives a major upgrade \u2014 the culmination of many months of work. We are particularly proud of the mainnet release of RIDE for dApps, enabling dApps implementations on Waves.RIDE for dAppsRIDE was written specifically for execution in a blockchain environment and designed for building applications that will form the next generation of the internet. RIDE includes the following features and properties:Lazy executionPredictable computation costsZero failed transactions on the networkModern typed functional approachSimple and conciseFormal-verification-friendlyFor more information about writing dApps on Waves, see https://docs.wavesplatform.com/en/smart-contracts/writing-dapps.html.Mathematical functionsWe have also added new mathematical functions to the RIDE programming language: logarithms and exponentiation. This allows developers to perform calculations on the Waves blockchain. There are cases when you need to calculate models by formulas \u2014 for example in economic or physical models \u2014 and this is now possible with RIDE. One of the use cases for this functionality is implementing an algorithmic stable coin.gRPC interfaceWe are implementing an alternative to the REST API, which has a number of advantages. It is a mechanism for standard description of interfaces and data formats. Users of our API (who are mostly developers) can use this tool as a communication protocol between an application and the blockchain. The new interface allows reduced development time. After the release we will start standardising the presentation format of data: transactions, blocks, addresses, aliases and all possible entities on the Waves blockchain.The standardisation process will be coordinated with the community: we will listen to feedback from developers and adjust the standards to their needs. As a result of this process, we will add these formats to the protocol of interaction of elements of Waves\u2019 infrastructure. Our main goal is to come to the use of Protocol Buffers and make interaction with the Waves infrastructure simple, fast and convenient, as well as easy to support in all existing libraries for all programming languages.Asset order feesThis release also sees a new feature for Waves ecosystem users: DEX fees in assets other than WAVES. The Waves community has long requested this feature and now we are introducing it. The DEX will soon support the ability to pay commissions for any orders with any tokens in ETH and BTC, along with WAVES. When choosing an asset other than WAVES, the fee is calculated based on the current exchange rate on Waves DEX.NFTAfter this update it will be possible to issue Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Waves blockchain. The issue transaction is the same as before, but for issuing an NFT, it must be: non-reissuable; decimals should be 0; and quantity must be 1. If these conditions are met, the issuance price drops from 1 WAVES to 0.001 WAVES. These tokens can also be issued with a script in the RIDE language, making them non-fungible smart assets. With this innovation, the platform becomes much more attractive for tokenisation of digital assets, with applications in gaming and for other digital collectibles.Voting for the releaseAs usual, the update initialises a process of voting for miners on the network. A successful conclusion to the voting process is required to activate the new protocol and switch on smart contracts for network users. After reaching the required 80% of votes, the protocol will be activated a week later. When activation occurs, all these functions will become available for users and developers.Join Waves CommunityRead Waves News channelFollow Waves TwitterWatch on Waves YoutubeSubscribe to Waves Subreddit", "responses": 1, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Coding", "Programming", "Web3"]}, {"title": "Mainframe: A Platform for Decentralized Applications", "post_link": "https://blog.mainframe.com/mainframe-a-platform-for-decentralized-applications-a861fd69db0d?source=search_post", "author_name": "Carl Youngblood", "author_link": "https://blog.mainframe.com/@cayblood", "publish_date": "2018-05-17", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-21", "readtime": "4.96", "claps": 143, "voters": 16, "content": "Mainframe: A Platform for Decentralized ApplicationsCarl YoungbloodFollowMay 17, 2018 \u00b7 5 min readWe enjoyed ourselves immensely at the 2018 Swarm Summit in beautiful Ljubljana, Slovenia. It was a great opportunity for us to articulate our development plans in more detail. The follow is an overview of my presentation. Check out the video for more information.My presentation for the 2018 Swarm SummitBack when hardly any of us were working in blockchain-related technologies, before the Ethereum pre-sale had even begun, many of us were alarmed by revelations that the NSA was conducting mass surveillance of Internet users and telecom customers in the U.S. and the rest of the world. At that time, I asked the question: \u201cWill we ever get to a point where the core protocols are robust and secure enough that surveillance and centralized control of the Internet becomes effectively infeasible?\u201d I\u2019m grateful to have the privilege of working full-time on this problem now.The problem is a challenging one. Several factors contribute to the current weaknesses in the Internet, and they all need to be addressed for us to have a truly decentralized and free web. The term web3 is sometimes used to refer to this promising new phase of web freedom.Some ask, if we\u2019re currently in web 2.0, what was the first version? The initial web (1.0) was characterized by largely static websites that exposed content and provided services to users, such as e-commerce, news etc. without much two-way communication. Web 2.0 was characterized by more user-generated content and a richer user experience. It is commonly associated with the rise of social media.With this rise came certain problems. Because the current protocols that power the Internet provide no means of directly profiting from them, Internet companies were motivated to extract value at higher levels. This took the form of products and services built on top of these lower layers, ultimately consolidated in the hands a few large companies who provide these services with ulterior motives. Users don\u2019t pay for the product \u2014 they are the product. The data they share with these large providers is used to target advertisements and other content to users in a way that maximizes these companies\u2019 profits, often with negative side-effects.Web3 promises to correct this imbalance by allowing similar applications and services to be powered by incentivized protocols running on decentralized peer-to-peer networks. The value is captured primarily at the protocol layer instead of the application layer.In contrast with centralized, siloed web2 services, web3 ensures decentralization by capturing more value at the protocol layer.Several services need to be replaced for weaknesses of web2 to be overcome:IP addresses, which can be blocked and/or traced to users\u2019 geographic locations, must be replaced with a peer-to-peer addressing overlay that maintains the anonymity of the user.Domain Name System (DNS), which is used to associate memorable names with numeric addresses, is managed by centralized authorities that are subject to corruption and authoritarian control. It can also be blocked and hijacked by misbehaving DNS servers under the control of local authorities. Decentralized solutions, such as ENS (Ethereum Name Service), which manages name-reference associations with a blockchain, are required to keep name services free and decentralized.Decentralized payments allow value to be exchanged between individuals across jurisdictions in near real-time, without reliance on centralized infrastructure like banks and remittance systems.Secure communications are needed beyond mere encryption. Web3 communications use protocols that resist censorship and surveillance by keeping participants\u2019 chatter indistinguishable from random noise.Web3 users and decentralized applications (Dapps) require file storage provided by peer-to-peer networks without managed infrastructure.When data needs to be accessed quickly and randomly, decentralized databases must be available. These must also run on distributed networks rather than managed infrastructure.Computing services are required to run periodic tasks when all of a user\u2019s devices are disconnected, or tasks that would be computationally infeasible or difficult on a user\u2019s devices. These services must be run by authorized nodes in the peer-to-peer network rather than on managed infrastructure.In order for these services to continue to run indefinitely in the absence of their creators, they must be properly incentivized. That is, each service-providing node must be given monetary incentives to provide good service and avoid cheating. Incentivization is a difficult problem at the cutting edge of computer science research.The challenge of Dapp development at the present moment is that each of these service layers is so new and immature. Startups typically learn that they will need to create the equivalent of three or four other startups before they can even begin to work on the project they actually want to build. We believe we can add tremendous value by helping service layer projects to mature, and by being a convenient \u201cglue\u201d layer between these services and Dapp developers.The Mainframe platform is a developer-friendly SDK providing all these services in a secure peer-to-peer fashion. It is designed to be modular and pluggable, so developers and users can configure which projects they prefer to use for the underlying service layers. Our mission is to delight developers by providing an SDK that is well-documented, supported and backed by strong developer communities.Because it is not always clear which projects will gain the most momentum, and because developers often have varying preferences, we feel that it is important to design our underlying service architecture to be modular and pluggable, allowing developers and users to configure which projects they prefer to use for each service layer and abstracting away as much of the differences as possible. A single medium of exchange in the form of Mainframe tokens (MFT) is also used to improve the developer and user experience. Where underlying service layers cannot be retrofitted to accept MFT, we will implement atomic swaps between native service-layer tokens and MFT.We are also contributing to various projects to help these service layers to reach maturity faster. So far, we have several engineers collaborating on the Swarm project and are very grateful for the support of the Swarm team.Conceptual diagram of the Mainframe PlatformWe expect our first major milestone of the SDK to implement functional versions of all service layers, as well as tools for development and deployment. Subsequent milestones will add incentivization. Delivery of working code will occur all along the way in the form of small point releases leading up to these larger milestones. With this approach, we hope to get functionality into the hands of our customers more quickly and learn about their biggest needs.In addition to the SDK, Mainframe will be releasing several reference Dapps, including Onyx, a decentralized messaging app. These Dapps will help our customers to see what can be done with the framework, learn best practices, and help us to find and fix bugs in the platform.We\u2019re thrilled to be building web3 with you, our developers.

We have now reached the first milestone on this, and the release of Node update 0.17 brings RIDE for dApps to TestNet!As we\u2019ve discussed at length before, blockchain really isn\u2019t designed for carrying out complicated computations. Blockchain architecture simply isn\u2019t suited to this. After seeing the vulnerabilities and edge cases that have arisen on Ethereum, Waves has always maintained that Turing-completeness should not be essential for on-chain blockchain computations. The RIDE language itself is deliberately non-Turing complete for this reason. However, Turing complete computations can still be achieved by spreading operations over consecutive blocks, if such functionality is required. RIDE therefore offers a flexible but safe solution for on-blockchain computation.RIDE for dApps is being introduced to grant an account a way of assigning a programmable function to itself, with callable functions that are able to:Receive paymentsChange the account\u2019s stateSend WAVES and tokens from the accountTo initiate the call, we have added a new command: InvokeScriptTransaction. This needs to be put on the blockchain to call a function, and the sender pays fees to the miner for the invocation to be executed. The sender can optionally attach payment in WAVES or tokens, and upon invocation the contract state can be changed and the contract can make multiple payments.The existing mechanics for authorisation scripts will be maintained under the @Verifier function of the account. This can be thought of as an \u2018admin\u2019 function for the contract\u2019s owner or owners. By default, the contract, contract data and contract tokens are all controlled by the private key for the account. Multisig control is possible. If @Verifier is always false, then the contract is sealed \u2014 immutable.We will now give an overview of some of the use cases that this new functionality makes possible. As we know, these functions can generate transfers (transfer of funds from the contract address) and change a dApp\u2019s state (via DataTransactions from the contract account). Moreover, RIDE for dApps makes implementation of certain use cases far easier and more convenient.Dividing funds into two equal partsSuppose we need to implement a mechanism to split the funds in an account equally between two specific addresses.Consider an implementation using a smart account: the script allows the account to send only MassTransfer transactions that meet the specified conditions:There are two recipients: Alice and BobFee = 0.006 WAVESEach of them is sent exactly ((balance-fee) / 2) WAVESThe account can only send a transaction that meets the conditions described above. Other transactions will not be accepted on the blockchain.let Alice = Address(base58'3NBVqYXrapgJP9atQccdBPAgJPwHDKkh6A8')let Bob = Address(base58'3N78bNBYhT6pt6nugc6ay1uW1nLEfnRWkJd')let fee = 600000match(tx) {# only MassTransferTransactions are allowedcase tx : MassTransferTransaction =># check if the transaction has exactly two predefined recipientstx.transferCount == 2&& tx.transfers[0].recipient == Alice&& tx.transfers[1].recipient == Bob# check if WAVES are distributed evenly&& tx.assetId == unit&& tx.transfers[0].amount == (wavesBalance(tx.sender) - fee) / 2&& tx.transfers[0].amount == tx.transfers[1].amount# check if the fee is equal to 0.006 WAVES&& tx.fee == fee# the other types of transactions are prohibitedcase _ => false}In RIDE 4 dApps we do this differently: you can divide the funds between two given addresses by calling the \u2018split\u2019 function described in the script. This function divides all the funds of the account-contract in half, sending them to two addresses \u2014 Alice and Bob. You can call this function by sending InvokeScriptTransaction. In this case, the fee is paid by the one who sends the transaction, so you do not need to check the fee in the script code.To write your first dApp on testnet, use our developers tool Waves IDE:{-# STDLIB_VERSION 3 #-}{-# CONTENT_TYPE DAPP #-}{-# SCRIPT_TYPE ACCOUNT #-}# predefined addresses of recipientslet Alice = Address(base58'3NBVqYXrapgJP9atQccdBPAgJPwHDKkh6A8')let Bob = Address(base58'3N78bNBYhT6pt6nugc6ay1uW1nLEfnRWkJd')@Callable(i) func splitBalance() = {# calculate the amount of WAVES that will be transferred to Alice and Boblet transferAmount = wavesBalance(this) / 2# the result of a contract invocation contains two transfers (to Alice and to Bob)TransferSet([ScriptTransfer(Alice, transferAmount, unit),ScriptTransfer(Bob, transferAmount, unit)]) }Register of addresses that have paid for a serviceImagine that we want to create a service that allows you to register payment for services by users (for example, a monthly subscription). Subscribers each pay 10 WAVES, with the time of the last payment being entered into the register.Consider the implementation using a smart account. The account script only allows DataTransactions that meet the following conditions:0.005 WAVES feeTwo entries<transfer_id> : \u201cused\u201d<payment_sender_address> : <current_height>3. In the proofs array, the first element is the transfer transaction id (payment for services), which includes:The recipient address for the contractAmount >= 10 WAVES + 0.005 WAVES (to pay for DataTx fee)Id was not previously used as a key (to prevent double-spending)# fixed payment and fee valueslet dataTxFee = 500000let paymentAmount = 1000000000let this = tx.sendermatch (tx){# only DataTransactions are allowedcase  t: DataTransaction =># extract the payment transaction's id from the DataTransactionlet paymentTxId = toBase58String(t.proofs[0])# extract the provided payment transaction from the blockchainlet paymentTx = transactionById(fromBase58String(paymentTxId))match (paymentTx) {# the provided payment transaction should be a TransferTransactioncase paymentTx : TransferTransaction =># check if the payment transaction was not used before (to prevent double-spending)getString(this, paymentTxId) == unit# check if the payment recipient is this account&& paymentTx.recipient == this# check if the transfer amount exceeds the required minimum&& paymentTx.amount >= paymentAmount + dataTxFee# check if the transferred asset is WAVES&& paymentTx.assetId == unit# check if the data satisfies the specified format&& size(t.data) == 2&& getString(t.data, paymentTxId) == \"used\"&& getInteger(t.data, toBase58String(tx.sender.bytes)) == height# check if the fee is correct&& t.fee == dataTxFeecase _ => false}# the other types of transactions are prohibitedcase _ => false}The main disadvantage of this approach is the complex mechanics: you need to send two transactions, one of which refers to the other, as well as send transactions on behalf of other account (specify the sender address of the contract).Using RIDE for dApps everything is much easier. The payment can be attached to InvokeScriptTransaction. We need only check in the script that the payment was attached. If the address calling the script pays at least 10 WAVES, it is entered into the registry.{-# STDLIB_VERSION 3 #-}{-# CONTENT_TYPE DAPP #-}{-# SCRIPT_TYPE ACCOUNT #-}# fixed payment amountlet paymentAmount = 1000000000@Callable(i) func pay() ={# check if the attached payment is at least 10 WAVESlet payment = extract(i.payment)if (payment.assetId != unit || payment.amount < paymentAmount)then throw(\"You have to provide a payment of at least 10 WAVES\")# the result of a contract invocation contains one dataEntry(<caller_address>, <current_height>)else WriteSet([DataEntry(toBase58String(i.caller.bytes), height)])}VotingIn this example, a non-anonymous vote is implemented based on known voting lists and candidates. An account ballot is prepared in advance (sent to the list via DataTransaction), including:The list of voters (for each voter create an entry { <voter_address_voted>, false })The list of candidates (for each candidate create an entry { <candidate_address>, 0 }).To implement using a smart account, the account script allows only DataTransactions:Submitted by voters who have not already voted. The voter\u2019s public key goes in proofs[1] and signs this DataTransactions (the signature itself goes in the proofs[0]).The DataTx contains exactly two entries:<candidate> : <current_value> + 1<voter_address_voted> : truelet this = tx.sendermatch(tx){# only DataTransactions are allowedcase tx : DataTransaction =># extract the chosen candidate from the transactionlet candidate = tx.data[0].key# check if the transaction was signed by the voterlet voterPublicKey = tx.proofs[1]let voterKey = toBase58String(addressFromPublicKey(voterPublicKey).bytes) + \"_voted\"sigVerify(tx.bodyBytes, tx.proofs[0], voterPublicKey)# check if the voter has not voted yet&& extract(getBoolean(this, voterKey)) == false# check if the data satisfies the specified format&& size(tx.data) == 2&& extract(getInteger(tx.data, candidate)) == extract(getInteger(this, candidate)) + 1&& extract(getBoolean(tx.data, voterKey)) == truecase _ => false}In RIDE for dApps, in the contract script we describe the vote function, which can be called to vote for a certain candidate.{-# STDLIB_VERSION 3 #-}{-# CONTENT_TYPE DAPP #-}{-# SCRIPT_TYPE ACCOUNT #-}@Callable(i) func vote(candidate : String) ={let voterKey = toBase58String(i.caller.bytes) + \"_voted\"# check if the caller is registered as a voterif (!isDefined(getBoolean(this, voterKey))) then throw(\"You are not registered as a voter\")# check if the voter has not voted yetelse if (extract(getBoolean(this, voterKey)) == true) then throw(\"You have already voted\")# check if the candidate is in the voting listelse match (getInteger(this, candidate)) {case r : Int =>WriteSet([DataEntry(candidate, r + 1),DataEntry(voterKey, true)])case _ => throw(\"Candidate is not in the voting list\")     } }WalletIn this example, a dApp wallet is implemented: you can send a WAVES payment, and it will save it in the wallet (deposit function), and you can take deposited WAVES back out of the wallet (withdraw function).{-# STDLIB_VERSION 3 #-}{-# CONTENT_TYPE DAPP #-}{-# SCRIPT_TYPE ACCOUNT #-}func getBalance(address: String) ={match getInteger(this, address){case a: Int => acase _ => 0} }@Callable(i) func deposit() ={let caller = toBase58String(i.caller.bytes)let currentBalance = getBalance(caller)let payment = match(i.payment){case p : AttachedPayment => pcase _ => throw(\"You have to provide a payment to deposit\")}if (payment.assetId != unit) then throw(\"This wallet cannot hold assets other than WAVES\")   else {let newBalance = currentBalance + payment.amountWriteSet([DataEntry(caller, newBalance)])} }@Callable(i) func withdraw(amount: Int) ={let caller = toBase58String(i.caller.bytes)let currentBalance = getBalance(caller)if (amount < 0) then throw(\"Can't withdraw negative amount\")else if (amount > currentBalance) then throw(\"Not enough balance\")else {let newBalance = currentBalance - amountScriptResult(WriteSet([DataEntry(caller, newBalance)]),TransferSet([ScriptTransfer(i.caller, amount, unit)]))} }ExchangerThis example shows implementation for a dApp-exchanger, which buys/sells WAVES and USD at a fixed price. It describes the functions \u2018buyWAVESforUSD\u2019 and \u2018sellWAVESforUSD\u2019.

In the first article in a series devoted to blockchain data oracles, we discuss how Waves\u2019 protocol will help make an oracle accessible to the entire community.A smart contract written on the blockchain is unable to access data outside its own network. This problem is resolved by using data oracles, which are basically agents that find real-world information and feed it to the blockchain for use by smart contracts and dApps.In other words, oracles are tools that facilitate communication between the blockchain and the real world. Data they feed to the blockchain could be as diverse as currency exchange rates, weather reports, results of elections or sporting events, commodity prices or even flight and train timetables.Execution of smart contracts could be triggered by meeting pre-set conditions which, in turn, require data of the right kind to be available.Major blockchain platforms have recently shown interest in creating tools for data oracles, such as Ethereum, which runs Ethereum Oracle.Waves offers its own data oracle tool, based on the already available DataTransactions.On a purely technical level, creating a data oracle for the blockchain is very straightforward.All you need to do is take an outside source of information and send an initializing DataTransaction, announcing the oracle and explaining what type of data it will be providing. Subsequently, the data will be accessible for smart contracts.However, there is one problem. How can you know if a data oracle for a specific type of information is available on the blockchain, how often it is updated and what source of information it uses?Waves\u2019 solution is a protocol for data oracles, which is basically a standardized set of fields for entering information to the blockchain.Regardless of whether data is entered manually or automatically, the protocol includes fields for main values, which will help other community members to find the oracle and learn what type of data it feeds to the blockchain, what the third-party source is and how frequently the data is updated.A developer can use an existing protocol, which is available on Waves\u2019 GitBook, or expand it, if necessary.The process is simple. To make things easier for developers, Waves offers a data oracle developing tool, which will be integrated in a single interface with a public directory of data oracles, broken down by category.If a developer wants their oracle to be accessible to other members of the Waves community, helping the entire ecosystem and also generating revenues, they can fill in various DataTransaction fields, describing the oracle.That information will be converted, and an initializing DataTransaction will be formed.Later, the developer will be able to update the oracle\u2019s data \u2014 for instance, change its status or add a new field in the description. We suggest that developers update the oracle\u2019s version for each format change and provide a brief description of changes, making the oracle\u2019s operation easier for other developers who already use its data.Once the initializing DataTransaction has been sent, the oracle will be accessible in the directory in the category stated by the developer.Use Waves\u2019 oracle development tool to create a data oracle, and our protocol will help make your oracle visible on the blockchain!Further down the road, there are plans to create a database of open-source protocols to help developers create standards for blockchain data oracles in various fields, with the ultimate goal of improving interoperability and compatibility of IT and blockchain systems.Join Waves CommunityRead Waves News channelFollow Waves TwitterSubscribe to Waves Subreddit", "responses": 3, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Blockchain Technology", "Blockchain Development", "Web3", "Wavesplatform"]}, {"title": "The New Way to Build and Deploy Smart Contracts", "post_link": "https://medium.com/gochain/the-new-way-to-build-and-deploy-smart-contracts-9a375d282c26?source=search_post", "author_name": "GoChainGo", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@gochaingo", "publish_date": "2019-02-06", "last_modified_date": "2019-02-06", "readtime": "1.54", "claps": 477, "voters": 17, "content": "The New Way to Build and Deploy Smart ContractsGoChainGoFollowFeb 6 \u00b7 2 min readBuilding and deploying smart contracts with existing tools is a confusing and cumbersome process, forcing you to write a bunch of JavaScript code \ud83d\udca9 or to use a web based interface that you can\u2019t integrate into your dev/build environment.

To provide a full user experience, a dApp needs to process at least its own data, to show a particular user\u2019s activity, build a user profile, show analytics and enable multiple features\u2026 How can we do all that now?A number of dApp development teams are doing this by building their own custom solutions \u2014 scraping blockchain data, tracking events, transactions, and storing them in a traditional centralized database. But we want trust minimization on web3, right?Summarizing the problem \u2014\u201cdApps need indexed data to perform large-scale queries to enable a full-featured User Experience in a trust-minimized way\u201dEnter: The Graph.What is The Graph?The Graph team is solving this problem by building a decentralized protocol which will be enabled by Graph Nodes processing Ethereum events and storing them as indexed data which dApps can query through an API endpoint.Graph Protocol falls into a category we refer to as a layer 2 read-scalability solution. Its purpose is to enable decentralized applications (dApps) to query public blockchain data efficiently and trustlessly via a service that, like blockchains and the Internet itself, operates as a public utility. This is in the interest of minimizing the role of brittle, centralized infrastructure seen in many \u201cdecentralized\u201d application architectures today. \u2014 Graph Protocol SpecificationThese Indexes (\u201csubgraphs\u201d) are currently being hosted by The Graph team. But, in the future, these Indexes will live on fully decentralized network of Graph Nodes.How does The Graph work?Let's dig deeper and understand how The Graph actually works:dApps (through their smart contracts) create Ethereum transactions, which emit events.Graph Nodes scan every Ethereum block looking for events.Graph Nodes find events for your subgraph in Ethereum blocks and runs the mapping handlers you provided. This mapping decides how data gets stored and updated in Graph Nodes.Your dApp can query this data through GraphQL APIs, which get translated by Graph Nodes to fetch indexed data.So, what are we waiting for? Let\u2019s build a Subgraph!Image source \u2014 TheGraph DocsBuild a SubgraphLet\u2019s use a sample smart contract with Truffle project and build a subgraph.Graph ExplorerUsing Graph Explorer you can explore other subgraphs built by the community. We can also query subgraphs using Graph Explorer UI.We need to create an account on Graph Explorer and get an Access Token, which will be used while deploying our subgraph on Graph Nodes (hosted by The Graph team). So let's create an account on the Graph Explorer.Create a subgraph using Graph Explorer UI with name \u201cexample\u201d.Now we need to install Graph-CLI in our system (I am using Ubuntu 16.10):sudo yarn global add @graphprotocol/graph-cliLet\u2019s create an example-subgraph by using the command below:graph init buddies2705/example-subgraph example-subgraph// Command Syntax graph init <GITHUB_USER>/<SUBGRAPH_NAME> <DIRECTORY>// Here Direcotry is optional, if you don't pass it it will create a directory with SUBGRAPH_NAME Let\u2019s install dependency and generate mappings://Install Dependencies yarn//Generate Mappingsyarn codegenLet\u2019s establish Auth using Access token (we can get this Access Token from the Graph Explorer dashboard):graph auth https://api.thegraph.com/deploy/<ACCESS_TOKEN>Now we can deploy our subgraph on the Graph Explorer using the command below:graph deploy     --debug     --node https://api.thegraph.com/deploy/     --ipfs https://api.thegraph.com/ipfs/     buddies2705/example//You can see we are using buddies/example where \"buddies2705\" is my //github username and \"example\" is our subgraph name create using //Graph explorer UI.Now open Graph Explorer and you can see your subgraph. You can query your subgraph too using the Graph Explorer UI. You can also see endpoints to interact programmatically with your Subgraph.Subgraph GraphQL API URLsUnder the HoodLet\u2019s go deeper and understand what happened \u201cUnder the Hood\u201d. We had a Truffle project with a Gravity.sol contract, which is simply creating a Gravatar (your Avatar on the Internet) on Ethereum.This contract is emitting two eventsNewGravatar \u2014 When a new Gravatar get createdUpdatedGravatar \u2014 When an existing Gravatar gets updatedevent NewGravatar(uint id, address owner, string displayName, string imageUrl);event UpdatedGravatar(uint id, address owner, string displayName, string imageUrl);If we index these two Data events, we can answer queries like:How many Gravatars were created last year?How many Gravatars get updated per day on average?What is the top 10 image hosts for all our Gravatars? (it will be IPFS \ud83d\ude0e)What are the most common names for Gravatars?Some of these queries need to run on full contract data from the time the Contract deployed, and this is not possible from the normal web3 queries. You need indexed data.With The Graph, you can create mappings to index this Data, which will live in the Data-store (currently Postgres). So, let\u2019s see how mappings get created:Important FilesLet\u2019s first look at the subgraph.yaml, which defines all mappings:Subgraph.yamlLet\u2019s take a look at the important fields of this file:dataSources: Data sources will have all the smart contracts you want to track. (In our case, It\u2019s only 1).All other fields are self-explanatory, so let's look into eventHandlers field, which is defining our mappings:eventHandles: in this field, we will define our mappings. We will add events and functions which will handle those events. For example, we are defining handleNewGravatar for our NewGravatar event.file: This field will have our Mapping file containing event handler functions, which is mapping.ts in our case.mapping.ts is where you implement event handlers\u2026 these event handlers will execute whenever our Gravatar events get emitted, creating entities and saving them to the store, as we have described in our event handler functions.You can see that we are importing two files, Gravity.ts and Schema.ts\u2014 both files get generated when we ran yarn codegen. These files contain types, which make working with contracts, events, and entities easy. We also have a schema.graphql,which will contain entities.type Gravatar @entity {  id: ID!  owner: Bytes!  displayName: String!  imageUrl: String!}Our schema.ts file gets generated using this schema.graphql and our Gravity.ts file gets generated based on smart contract Gravity.sol .These are a lot of GraphQL concepts. If you don\u2019t know about GraphQL check here, but you can build a basic subgraph with a minimum understanding of GraphQL.Build a subgraph for you dAppIf you are running a dApp, you\u2019ve probably faced this Data problem.Below are the steps which you will need to follow for building a custom subgraph for your dApp (as outlined above).Install Graph-CLI and other dependenciesCreate a subgraph.yamlCreate schema.graphqlGenerate schema filesCreate a Mapping file with the event handlersUseful CommandsGraph-CLI exposes useful commands you can file them under package.json.We have built a basic FOMO3d subgraph, check it out!ConclusionThe best property which people still do not still recognize is that Web3 Infrastructure will enable autonomous internet applications, which can sustain for foreseeable future without any maintenance.Web3 \u2014 Build, Deploy, no need to MaintainDecentralization and trust minimization is a difficult problem to solve.

He explains how the popular code version management protocol called Git complements the blockchain perfectly, to support end-user-facing decentralized applications on the open Web.At Cardstack, we\u2019ve been working on an essential piece of infrastructure: It\u2019s called Gitchain. While this is a tricky piece of technology to explain, because it connects Git and blockchain \u2014 two things nobody really understands \u2014 it is an important piece of our vision of bringing the Web to the 3.0 era. It allows applications to be broken into small components called cards, which move fluidly between individual organizations, and enables people to live self-sovereign lives through the ownership of data.When it comes to blockchain-based applications, people always ask, \u201cDoes everything you do on a website or in a Web app belong to the blockchain? Do you write absolutely everything to the blockchain?\u201d The answer is \u201cno\u201d. Writing information to the blockchain is time-consuming and expensive. Therefore, it is not an efficient way of storing a massive amount of data; especially as much data as it takes to run an application people will find comparable in quality and sophistication to what they\u2019re used to with centralized websites. That is why we focus on using Git as a protocol.The primary, best-known technique for building end-usable, scalable applications using blockchain is called \u201cLayer 2 architecture\u201d, which means: You build a layer that does not write everything to a blockchain; and most of the interaction goes into this Layer 2.Gitchain is a chain-agnostic Layer 2 application state synchronization and syndication protocol based on Git. Basically, Gitchain is a Layer 2 application protocol; and some subset of the application state that is stored in this Layer 2 protocol gets anchored onto the blockchain. This allows us to achieve scalable applications that are end-user friendly, while still getting a lot of the nice characteristics that come with the use of blockchain.Our approach is about something familiar to people on the Web: content and data application. We have published a video about our vision regarding content creation and distribution. It shows how easy collaboration can be, as people author content they can then share with each other \u2014 a simple workflow coordinated through a protocol. This use case of content creation and distribution introduces the idea of Git combined with blockchain.Teaser video about content creation and distribution\u2013done the Web 3.0 way: Cardstack enables makers, storytellers, developers, and designers to form decentralized networks and finally create on their own terms.Git is a version control software that was invented by Linus Torvald \u2014 the creator of Linux, which runs most of the world these days. Blockchain is a way to record global rights. And Git, the protocol itself, actually has a lot in common with the blockchain.Wikipedia says: \u201cThe Git history is stored in such a way that the ID of a particular version (a commit in Git terms) depends upon the complete development history leading up to that commit. Once it is published, it is not possible to change the old versions without it being noticed. The structure is similar to a Merkle tree, but with added data at the nodes and leaves.\u201dIf we change a couple of words, it sounds like a blockchain. Git is a cryptographical chain of hashes of history \u2014 similar to how the blockchain is a cryptographically authenticated history. They are so similar because the way to keep track of revisions is to make sure that the new version always refers to the old version.But when we say \u201cGitchain\u201d, we don\u2019t just mean using Git as a blockchain. We mean adding what\u2019s good about Git and what makes it powerful \u2014 what makes Git the number-one way for developers to collaborate to create complicated software bundles and code in an open-source way, both within and outside enterprises on the open Web and blockchain. We\u2019re imagining new ways of creating this global marketplace.In bringing Git and blockchain together, we want to achieve a powerful combination. Git has this unique quality: Whoever uses Git as a content management system realizes that it\u2019s very easy to fork a repository. Take a version of a piece of software or an HTML file, fork it, and try something else. If you like it, you can commit it back as the official version by merging your changes back in. Forking blockchain is quite common (though not easy and not necessarily desirable). But we don\u2019t merge in the blockchain. We just fork.Blockchain also creates this opportunity to arrive at a consensus of a global truth: Everybody agrees that this is the account balance of a certain address, or that something that has been put on the blockchain will be there forever (you can point to the time stamp for this particular element). Git doesn\u2019t really do that. So, Git is actually a radically decentralized vision of a protocol.When Linus first came up with Git, there was no GitHub \u2014 no centralized authority for managing things. Therefore, the idea of Git is that there is no central authority. And on the blockchain, a global truth exists \u2014 so that one piece of content, once everybody agrees, is updated and synchronized accordingly. Combining the radical decentralization and flexibility of Git with the type of consensus we get from the blockchain is what we aim to do.Let\u2019s use an example that has nothing to do with Git or blockchain. Think about word processing:When you write an article about the \u201cUltimate Snowboard Experience\u201d, you use a word processor like Microsoft Word. Through that tool, you create something called content. That content is encoded in a word document (.docx). The distribution consists of adding that Word document to a shared folder like a Dropbox folder; when it is synced or uploaded, it is considered distributed. This could happen through a mailing list too. That\u2019s the basic idea of content creation and distribution: You have a tool, which you use to create an artifact (some sort of bundle of text and images, etc.); then, you move that bundle to a place where it becomes accessible to everyone you want to share it with, or people get notified that they can download the document to their computers.To get closer to modern Web development, imagine this: Instead of using Microsoft Word, you use a Web page editor, where you can type, drag and drop, or use code to insert your text. But when you save a Web page, it\u2019s not as atomic as a docx file. It is a folder with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. That folder represents these interlinked resources \u2014 rendering this special fare to visit Norway for $250, for example.When you\u2019re done, you upload that folder to a Web server like visitnorway.deals, for which you pay a Web host USD $6 a month. There\u2019s an FTP account, you just type in your username and password, and that\u2019s how you distribute your work.However, this last step \u2014 the way to deliver the content for distribution \u2014 has changed. The Web page editor (which could be a Web app or a desktop app) still creates the same HTML-CSS-file; but instead of directly pushing it to the website by uploading it to an FTP server, you now check in your code (your HTML and CSS) to GitHub \u2014 a Git repository, a shared folder system that tracks version history. Once you have checked in your code, CI (Continuous Integration) automatically recognizes that someone has checked it in, that this is the official master version. It bundles everything together and deploys it to the cloud or to a server.GitHub not only monitors which files have been uploaded to the FTP server; it actually has a version management system. Anything you\u2019re working on locally is managed by the version control system Git. So, every single time you add a file, you can keep track of which file you\u2019re changing, which items you\u2019re adding, which images you\u2019re editing. And when you push it, Git keeps track of that set of commits as an atomic thing. Thus, Git acts like a chain, in that it remembers the entire history of your files in a cryptographical way. Everything has integrity when you push it to a service hosted by GitHub.com (which is a great website, where all developers put their code; it\u2019s the social network for open- and even closed-source development). GitHub basically becomes a clearinghouse for the things that are created and distributed on people\u2019s computers, with version-controlled folders managed by Git. Then, as a single source of truth, it helps you to deploy your content to a website.GitHub vs. GitchainStructurally, GitHub sits at the center, and creators (makers or coders) are just updating the Git Repository. They either update it on their computers first and then push it, or they update it directly on GitHub.com. That information gets sucked into GitHub, and that\u2019s where the workflow begins.GitHub is a very powerful network of people. They come to the centralized infrastructure of GitHub to do not only coding, but increasingly collaborating on content, data sets, specifications, documents, rules, regulations, and legal clauses. From a decentralization/blockchain-oriented perspective, this seems a bit uncomfortable. Does it make sense for everything to be routed through GitHub? The original version of Git, as Linus intended it, was very decentralized. So, the question we ask is: Could GitHub \u2014 this important position in the center \u2014 be replaced with something that is more like a protocol and less like a service?That\u2019s where Gitchain comes in: It allows creators to connect with each other, using a combination of a Git protocol and a blockchain system, so that they don\u2019t need a centralized entity to coordinate what they do.Let\u2019s simplify this by looking at two different repositories. One is owned by one person; the other one could be a company, a partner, or another person.Almost anything that is a file can be managed in a Git Repository. This is content in HTML, data in CSV, content or data in some JSON format, as well as code, Javascript, markups, and configuration files. Those are all files that can be checked into a Git Repository the same way they can be copied into a folder; except that Git keeps track of every change to every file, building up a content-addressable system that allows you to go back to a previous version.Let\u2019s say you want to make this set of things (your website, proposal, or other data set) available to another person. Right now, you have to upload it to GitHub. Instead, you could push it to Gitchain. The Gitchain will carry the whole bundle to the other side and allow another Git Repository, client, computer, or server to download all the information to recreate the content, data, and code. This is what we call synchronization \u2014 you\u2019re basically making a copy of the whole thing. Gitchain has a hollow middle (meaning: no centralized entity!) and routes around the boundary through the concept of a distributed network.Moving parts of Gitchain: Distributed Storage & Distributed LedgerTwo basic sets of infrastructure underline what we call Gitchain: Distributed Storage & Distributed Ledger. Essentially, it\u2019s all about pushing and syncing between two repos.If you have a 400-megabyte file, you can\u2019t put that on the blockchain; it\u2019s too big. So, you put it (along with all the changes, metadata, captions, and descriptions) into something called a \u201cpackfile\u201d: In a Git protocol, every single change is stored in the folder structure, which is very inefficient for a large amount. So, when you have to copy 4,000 files, you can create a packfile, which is like a zip file, except that it is compliant with Git. Once you have a packfile, you put it in Distributed Storage \u2014 which could be a shared drive on the cloud, a distributed file system like IPFS, or another type of blockchain-driven storage system.Now, you have to tell someone where this packfile is, and that\u2019s where the reference comes in. You put a record on the Distributed Ledger, which is limited in size, saying, \u201cWhoever finds this link in the Distributed Ledger can find the packfile; and with the packfile, they can recreate the original content, data, and/or code, or a mixture.\u201d By pushing it, you create the reference on the ledger. When the other person sees the reference, they can look up the packfile, download it through a Distributed Storage mechanism, and unpack it; then, they can sync and recreate the Git Repository.The process of figuring out how to pack the packfile, decode it, and reconstruct its history is done by Git. This protocol just works. Developers rely on it to make sure every single line of code that exists in a repository shows up on the website precisely. So, instead of creating your own protocol to synchronize Distributed Ledger and Storage, why don\u2019t you use the one that has been proven already? Let Git figure out how to unwrap packfiles for you.The key is that we only install tiny bits of data on-chain. More importantly, we store a consistent amount of data for each packfile, because we don\u2019t need to store the number of files that are involved in it, the number of changes that have been made, or the number of people who made those changes. All that information is condensed in the packfile through the Git protocol. All you have to do is tell the other person where the packfile is, plus maybe some logic about who can access it. But the majority of the data is considered off-chain \u2014 meaning not on the Distributed Ledger.It can be in the Distributed Storage. This Distributed Storage can handle megabytes, gigabytes, and in some cases terabytes of data. If you chop up the packfile further, you can store any amount of data off-chain, and just use tiny bits of on-chain data as instructions for the Git repositories to recreate that content data and code.Technical layersLooking at this from a technical perspective, we have a Distributed Ledger or Blockchain layer and a Distributed Storage layer, both of which are Layer 1 protocols. They sit on the bottom, providing a flexible, content-addressable ledger service. Your Git Repository is an abstraction sitting on top of that, allowing you to open up the folder instead of inspecting the blockchain or looking into a packfile, so you can see things clear-text.Layer 2 is the Distributed Sync and Syndication system, using Git as an online protocol. When you write a bunch of files, you want to pack them together and connect the versions via hashes (as the Wikipedia article suggests). Then, you upload the packfile into Distributed Storage. Once you know where it\u2019s going to be, you record the hash and the URL to that packfile on-chain, using a Distributed Ledger. That is how a consumer can find the packfile, download it, and unpack it. All you need are four actions: pack & upload the packfile, record it on-chain, decode it, then download & unpack it.On Layer 3, the Distributed User Hubs, users see what\u2019s in the Git Repository. Most developers will just send you to their GitHub to check out what they do. The Git stuff, text files, and code make sense to them. But if you are not a developer, you have no idea what that means \u2014 though it could be something as simple as a list of websites or a list of articles or books. People don\u2019t know how to look at markup, HTML, or JSON.Cardstack\u2019s approach: Why don\u2019t we represent these bits of information, which are in this Distributed Storage (Git), as cards? When you create the card (by filling out a form, writing an article, or creating some metadata about a video), we can take that data on the card and save it as a file in the Git Repository. And when you want to display this article, you can use the Git Repo. It\u2019s just like translating the title and description stored in the repository into something much friendlier, turning the structured data into a small part of a Web page or a little widget. And the actual media files themselves, which are called a BLOB (Binary Large Object), could be checked into a Git repository or referenced as something else that is stored in a Distributed Storage, stitched together by the user\u2019s hub. That is what Cardstack does.The idea is that these cards can represent data \u2014 content, podcasts, code, as well as logic, rules, or actions. At Cardstack, we have been working on building this Layer 3. But we always knew that we would have to go down to Layer 2. And that\u2019s why we are using the infrastructure of Git as the underlying foundation.Enterprise network optionYou can use four technologies together to build something fairly sophisticated.For instance, we have helped a large label and a large publishing company manage the metadata for their songs, their recordings, their musical work, their artists, and even their audio files in a way that allows them to version and change the files; so that, if someone has made a mistake, they can create a new version. Putting that on a blockchain directly would be very impractical, as there are so many fields and values (putting 100 or 1,000 values on the Ethereum blockchain takes a few hours). So, it requires us to do this packing \u2014 this reduction of the number of records that need to be put on the blockchain. This way, if you want to upload a music or content catalog of 50,000 files, you only need to make one blockchain transaction and point it to the packfile that contains all those changes.We use Cardstack as the UI layer and the data orchestration layer. We use Git as the underlying way of versioning it. We use S3 to store the packfile (cloud storage). And we use Hyperledger Sawtooth as the blockchain to synchronize these references.Public network optionIf someone wants to use a specific infrastructure like this, which has been built for a certain enterprise, to create a dApp (decentralized app), they can! This combination of Cardstack, Git, storage, and ledger is scalable and flexible to support other chains. After all, the Cardstack Hub has a plugin mechanism. Instead of storing something in S3, you can store it in IPFS. Plus, we plan to move all the code we are using to keep track of things on the private blockchain to Ethereum. So, if you want to publish something to Ethereum and store it in IPFS, we can help you synchronize that.If you want to use other storage mechanisms, you could just change the adapter between Cardstack and those protocols to make it happen. Additionally, Ethereum is going to shift around; there will be different chains that you can leverage, depending on what kind of security and network or characteristics you want. You can choose a different ledger or blockchain as your bottom layer, as you build up your network.It is becoming increasingly common for people building on blockchains to pair IPFS and Ethereum. The big stuff, like the user stake, goes to IPFS, and Ethereum is where the official stuff happens. It always requires this correlation, which can get out of sync. But Gitchain is extremely precise; because Git, as a protocol, has this hash history. And if we peg that to the blockchain history, it will never be out of sync by even one byte. That type of precision reduces the number of errors you will get from the end users. Now, using Git as the way to combine IPFS and Ethereum is something we are pioneering; but it makes a lot of sense, because it allows developers (especially developers who understand Git) to rely on their knowledge as they think about how user data is captured, stored, isolated, and shared.Git provides a very good foundation \u2014 not only for data that\u2019s stored entirely on Git and anchored on Ethereum, but also for private data that isn\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t be put on the chain at all. This type of isolation, using different repositories to reflect different organizational boundaries, is not really possible when you\u2019re putting everything on IPFS or on Ethereum, both of which are public. Git provides this additional granularity of trust. And Cardstack will support a lot of these patterns of access control natively.Card Board applicationCard Board is an open-source Web publishing system \u2014 an application we have built to showcase what we call an \u201carticle card\u201d. On GitHub, you see a version of it in a slightly refreshed design. This article card contains some text and images, and the whole bundle is stored in a folder managed by Git.For each article, the text is actually checked in; if you go to cardstack/cardboard-data on GitHub, you can see the article broken down into files. These are JSON-based files, so we can reconstruct the database by traversing the linkages between the articles, tags, and image references, to create something that basically forms an API. That\u2019s how this article card can render all these things as a beautiful snowboard trip.We started building the app on GitHub, since GitHub is a good scaffolding for our Git implementation and our Cardstack implementation (which interprets the Git results, showing people when there is a Medium clone or when there is something better than Medium, because you can theme it and use different modules, for example). We built an application we could test, because we wanted something we could use to test Gitchain. Having used Gitchain in a private network for the music vertical, we are now importing it to support this open-source Web publishing system. Then, we can use that as a test to say \u201call this doesn\u2019t have to go to cloud storage, but can go to IPFS and Ethereum\u201d.The great thing is that the application on top doesn\u2019t have to change at all. If you are a developer who likes Card Board, and you want to use it to build a podcast system or an interactive narrative experience, you can choose whether you care about decentralization or not. If you want to use the full Cardstack support for the GitHub plugin and the API, you can use that; you can just imagine that Gitchain doesn\u2019t exist. But if you are into decentralization and you want to use the Git protocol, but in a decentralized way, you can just flip a switch and use Gitchain. Then, your article is syndicated all around the world without being in a central place. That also applies to data systems, CRM-type systems, and even messaging systems. It\u2019s all about providing the ability for people to exchange data.To take it one step further: We were actually using a module within the node ecosystem called NodeGit, which uses the Git runtime as a piece of native software that\u2019s wrapped in Node.js, so we can access it. But we found an amazing new implementation of Git, called isomorphic-git, which allows people to run a Git client in Node.js, in native Javascript. So, we implemented the entire protocol in Node. This way, we don\u2019t have to deal with this native dependency of the C code and having to compile it. It\u2019s just Node.js code, but it runs in the browser too. So, we are using the Git protocol as a way to pack and unpack. Your cards and the Cardstack runtime could run in a browser, but provide this additional service that goes beyond a Metamask or Web 3.0 plugin. Cardstack gives you indexing, plus the authority to do security control, and the ability to compose data and merge multiple data streams.Currently, Cardstack runs on a node, because it has to run on a server. But with isomorphic-git, which we\u2019re switching all our Git work to, it will be able to run really well in a node ecosystem, while we are also able to add features. In fact, one of the APIs we added to the isomorphic-git through sponsorship (Open Collective) is a packfile support, so we can replace our zip file approach with a more compliant packfile. And that\u2019s a great collaboration, when everything below us \u2014 including Cardstack and the apps we build on top \u2014 is open-source. We aim to bring isomorphic-git to more people through the Cardstack experience, to see Git go beyond this niche of being a programmer\u2019s tool and become a fundamental protocol for sharing things on the Web.Chris Tse, Founding Director of the Cardstack Project, and Alex Speller, Senior Developer working on Gitchain, demonstrate how Card Board \u2014 a content-style application built on the Cardstack Framework \u2014 can synchronize its state, using Gitchain as a Layer-2 protocol on top of a distributed ledger.What\u2019s Multi-Git?When you are writing and submitting something for publication, you are not going to sync the whole folder containing all your novels. That\u2019s where Multi-Git comes in \u2014 a protocol sitting on top of the different Git repositories, making it possible to selectively share different portions of what you have worked on in Cardstack with other parties. We create new repositories that are shared between three or four people working together as a team, or inboxes where you can submit things that will be filtered within the organization, by moving around or promoting those cards or Git resources.This decentralized workflow has no intermediaries. You don\u2019t just put everything into one Google website and have Google route things. Instead, these files are moved from one node to the other. Since all of them run Cardstack, they will understand the relationships, for example: \u201cI\u2019m sending you my article, but my original file is really big, so you can get a low-resolution version. But when you pay for my article and you want to publish it, you can get the high-resolution version from me.\u201d These types of selective sharing and permissioning across multiparty workflows are what we call Multi-Git.But that\u2019s another topic for another day.Learn MoreCardstack\u2019s Card Folio App: Community DemoThe Tally Protocol: Scaling Ethereum With Untapped GPU PowerHow the Cardstack Framework Powers Decentralized ApplicationsCardstack.comJoin our Discord channel and star Cardstack on GitHub to follow updates on the Cardstack framework, Gitchain, and a suite of standard cards.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Git", "Open Source", "Web3", "Tech"]}, {"title": "Running Bitcoin @ WU", "post_link": "https://medium.com/crypto3conomics/running-bitcoin-wu-d9d9fa475cb4?source=search_post", "author_name": "Shermin Voshmgir", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@sherminvoshmgir", "publish_date": "2019-02-21", "last_modified_date": "2019-07-10", "readtime": "1.64", "claps": 106, "voters": 13, "content": "Running Bitcoin @ WUShermin VoshmgirFollowFeb 21 \u00b7 2 min readCo-Authors: Jan Valendin & Jakob HackelTo commemorate the 10-year history of Bitcoin, a few researchers at the Cryptoeconomics Research Lab launched a Bitcoin validation node, the first one hosted at the Vienna University of Economics & Business. The node stores the entire history of the Bitcoin network, and validates new transactions, as they are being added to the Bitcoin blockchain. This is a complementary function to Bitcoin mining, during which the miners compete for the right to create new blocks and add transactions to the blockchain. While Bitcoin mining is done almost exclusively on special purpose industrial grade hardware these days, a validation node is lightweight and simple to run on a regular home PC. Anyone running such a node can send and receive Bitcoin, and verify the integrity of the transactions, without having to rely on any third party. It is estimated that there are currently over 10,000 public validation nodes worldwide, running the most common Bitcoin implementation, Bitcoin Core.First Tweet of Hal Finney in 2009We are reminded of the early days of the Internet, and the important role that universities played in the establishment of shared internet protocols, but also indirectly building the internet infrastructure. As a public university, we feel it is our responsibility to support open source, censorship-resistant, borderless innovation, and to fulfill this duty we chose to participate in the Bitcoin network.As we are ramping up the activities of the Cryptoeconomics Research Lab, we plan to participate in other decentralized public networks, details of which will be announced soon. Our hope is that more universities and other public institutions will join and support the robustness of Bitcoin and other networks, by running parts of their infrastructure.About the AuthorShermin Voshmgir is the Author of the Book \u201cToken Economy\u201c.

Over the last three years, as the industry has matured, we have developed a more granular view of the specific technologies and protocols that make up Convergence and that informs how we invest.As a direct consequence of those investments and our work with startups, a growing corporate ecosystem, and leading academia, we have come to think of our portfolio in terms of a literal stack of highly synergistic technologies now framed as \u2018The Convergence Stack\u2019. A set of interlinked and open-source technologies spanning hardware, software, networking and applications that support a more secure, private, accessible and ultimately what we hope to be equitable digital infrastructure.However, the task of evolving and simultaneously realising such a vision is simply too colossal to be done in isolation. Instead this post serves as an open invite to engage both with us and the stack of technologies, their founders and communities to extend, deepen and diffuse their innovations. We hope the stack will be realized in concert with a diverse set of stakeholders from academia as well as early and later stage startups, to the largest corporates, supported by forward thinking regulators and governments.Because this is an open stack anyone can contribute to its codebase and because at their core these are decentralised networks anyone can contribute to their growth and subsequently participate in their economic success.Stack ExplorerThis high level design of the Convergence Stack is a starting point. We went through several iterations creating it, and imagine there will be many more possible versions as we collectively build it out together with our portfolio teams, especially in such a rapidly evolving technical and socio-economic environment. Our objective isn\u2019t to be definitive but rather to add to the debate.We have used the familiar OSI model to integrate these new protocols and networks in the broader technology industry rather than something separate and parallel. Although we made some tweaks to the layers because it doesn\u2019t map perfectly. Nevertheless the stack follows the same general structure from the physical layer at the bottom to the application layer at the top. Many projects will fall into multiple categories as they use combinations of technologies to solve their customers\u2019 problems. As the market matures and consolidates, projects will look to vertically and horizontally integrate and aim to have multiple products across the stack.Whilst the stack is open to anyone to develop and inform we will be looking to drive forward its evolution through a number of core working groups under the banner of The Convergence Alliance, made up of the respective protocol CTOs, integrators and enterprise customers which will be announced in some follow up posts by Outlier Ventures\u2019 CTO Aron van Ammers.Hardware Processing, Hardware Storage and Hardware NetworkingAt the bottom layer, it\u2019s likely that processing, storage and networking will all be integrated into an IoT device or machine. For clarity, we have chosen to break them out as separate components. First, secure hardware processing uses trusted execution environments (TEEs) to encapsulate confidential computations. We are seeing increased use of hardware security modules (HSMs) and trusted execution environments (TEEs) such as Intel SGX by the likes of The Oasis Team with Ekiden and Enigma Project. We expect to see further innovation in making TEEs truly secure as well as moves towards open-source chip architectures like RISC-V. Secondly, hardware storage products like Trezor, KeepKey and Ledger are already used to store private keys, and as the market matures its likely hardware storage will ultimately end up embedded into mobile devices and wearables. The Samsung S10 and the HTC Exodus are already leading the way in this regard. Thirdly, an often ignored point of centralized control is hardware networking. No matter how secure we make software, bits and bytes will need to move through a physical network of gateways, switches and bridges. Projects like NetFPGA, the Open Compute Project, and Telecom Infra Project (TIP) are pushing secure open-source designs in this area.Ledgers, Storage and NetworkingAbove the hardware come ledgers, storage and networking. Depending on functionality ledgers can be blockchains, smart contract platforms or dApp platforms. This is the area that seeded the broader \u2018web 3.0\u2019 movement and the source of fiercest competition today. Projects like ethereum, dfinity-network, Hedera Hashgraph Team, Sovrin Foundation and Fetch.AI are differentiating on scalability, security and decentralization; making different trade-offs depending on the targeted applications. Some are prioritizing scalability like IOTA Foundation and Zilliqa others security like Tezos and Cardano Foundation, and realistically only Bitcoin Foundation is committed above all else to maximising decentralization. There are of course private chains like R3 Corda, Quorum and other blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) solutions focusing on enterprise customer requirements where with known participants decentralization is less of a concern than security and scalability.Storage is a well-researched area in decentralised systems. IPFS is the current go-to provider, but there are many tokenized solutions like Sia Tech, Storj Labs and MaidSafe as well as the upcoming releases of Filecoin and ethereum\u2019s Swarm. Moving right, the final technology at this layer is networking. Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is typically ignored in the Web 3.0 space, but projects like OpenFlow and Facebook Open Switching System (FBOSS) are examples of widely used open source projects that manage networking equipment. Open-source and ideally community-driven SDN is vital in ensuring there are no centralized chokepoints in the overall stack.Scaling, Databases and BridgesAs we move up a layer we come to scaling, databases and bridges. Firstly, we are considering any project aiming to increase the performance of the underlying ledger as \u2018scaling,\u2019 which includes Lightning, Plasma, and bloXroute Team. For simplicity\u2019s sake we consider any type of state channel and sidechain to be included here. Secondly, there is an important role in the stack for decentralized databases like OrbitDB which ensure structured data is stored and shared in an accessible, peer to peer way. Finally, bridges like Interledger, Cosmos Network, Polkadot, and Aion Foundation ensure value and data can move across ledgers. Ultimately technologies at this layer are focused on making the decentralized web faster and interoperable.Authentication, Query and ComputeNext up is authentication, query and compute. Authentication can be considered the identity layer, and includes namespace registries like Handshake along with attestation like Evernym, uPort, and WebID. It\u2019s likely we will see a Facebook identity service enter the fray at some point, and Microsoft has been an active player in the decentralized identity ecosystem over the past few years already. Discovery and curation will become critical as the amount of data in decentralized systems increase, so what we call Query includes TheGraph as well as data verification tools and oracles such as ChainLink, XYO International and FOAM \u2014 essentially any tool that enables the indexing, querying and verification of decentralized data. Last, most computation on data must be done off-chain. Confidential and verifiable compute includes zero-knowledge and Multi-Party Computation (MPC) implementations like Truebit, Enigma Project and StarkWare. Over time we expect a tighter hardware and software integration to ensure end-to-end security.UX, API and MiddlewareSitting above the lower level tools but below the application layer are UX, API, and middleware. UX is how users engage with the decentralized web; we consider projects like Brave, MetaMask, and Status to be UX tools. Browsers, wallets, Conversational User Interfaces (CUIs) and spatial computing will all play a crucial role in abstracting away complexity and onboarding new users. APIs and other back end tooling like INFURA, DAppNode, and VIPnode are vital in ensuring the Web 3 space is accessible to the full community of open-source developers. Projects like Codius attempting to provide an open-source hosting platform also fit here. Finally, also sitting on this layer is middleware, platforms for building domain-specific applications. Examples include Dharma and MakerDAO in finance, Aragon in governance and Augur in forecasting.Applications, Marketplaces and LearningFinally, the top layer includes applications, marketplaces, and learning. Firstly, applications include all of the dApps as early adopters we know and love including the NFTs (non-fungible tokens) services like CryptoKitties, applications using middleware tools like Veil and Guesser, productivity apps like Graphite and financial services like Balance.io. Secondly, Marketplaces like Ocean Protocol Team, Streamr, Wibson and Tide Protocol fit here, ensuring data liquidity for the rest of the stack. Finally, machine learning is a core component of the Convergence stack. We have always believed that just like in Web 2.0, one of the most valuable places in the value chain is making use of the data available at lower layers of the stack. We expect real value to be created across all three machine learning paradigms \u2014 supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning. Projects like OpenMined and others are beginning to combine learning tools with decentralized storage and private compute to build more open, accessible and decentralised AI systems.Get in TouchThe Convergence Stack provides an open-source hardware, software, networking and application stack to support a more secure, private, accessible and equitable digital infrastructure. We want to partner with, support and invest in projects working in any of the areas including early stage startups, later stage projects, and corporate projects. If you think you are working on critical infrastructure that will accelerate this stack and vision we want to hear from you.Investment enquires: investment@outlierventures.ioResearch enquiries: research@outlierventures.ioEnterprise and partnership enquiries: partnership@outlierventures.ioMarketing or event enquiries: marketing@outlierventures.ioTo listen to a full explanation of the stack LIVE we invite you to a virtual conversation with two of the core components: Toby Simpson, CTO of Fetch.AI, decentralised AI for the machine economy and Ken Ebert, Software Architect and OS Engineer, Sovrin the new standard for digital identity.

This implementation consists of a number of Runtime Modules as well as Runtime Macros that transform them into the actual Runtime Rust code. W3F is looking for auditors to develop a threat model as well as identify any potential security vulnerabilities in the Library as well as any of the Modules.W3F will continue the work to secure software implementations related to Polkadot, this means that an additional goal of this audit is to identify potential long-term collaborators who are able to build up a comprehensive understanding of the protocol. We are looking for proposals which show potential for understanding of such long term support.This RFP document sets out the bidding instructions, requirements and deliverables for auditors who wish to submit a proposal to undertake this contract.Description of the Polkadot RuntimeThe Polkadot Runtime determines the functionality of the blockchain state machine in Polkadot, logic such as transaction verification, balance transfers and governance are determined by it. This logic is represented by a Wasm blob, which is compiled from Rust code. The Runtime is composed of a collection of modules from the Substrate runtime module library (SRML), as well as Polkadot specific modules. These modules are written as Rust source code and processed through Rust macros which generate the expanded Rust code that compiles to Wasm.The Polkadot Runtime Environment (PRE) is the outer shell of the Polkadot protocol. It handles the networking layer between the nodes in the network, the consensus logic and the execution of the Wasm Runtime. It will serve light clients and handle RPC requests. The first implementation of the PRE can be found in Substrate.This audit will only cover the Polkadot Runtime and not the PRE.Scope of the auditThe focus of this audit is the Runtime of Polkadot mostly composed of modules from the SRML. The audit should verify the logic of the modules and assess the framework for constructing the Wasm output.Modules that are used in the Polkadot Runtime:SRML Support:Macros used to compile Runtime Modules to expanded Rust codeWasm build scriptSRML Modules:BalancesConsensusCouncilDemocracyExecutiveFinality TrackerGrandpaIndicesSessionStakingSudoSystemTimestampPolkadot Modules:ClaimsCurated GrandpaParachainsThe modules to be audited (listed above) shall be the latest version of the code located in the SRML and Polkadot Runtime repositories.Threat modelFor the scope of this audit we assume that underlying Polkadot Runtime Environment is solid and implemented in accordance with specification.We also assume that the actual machine running the code is not compromised.Under those assumptions, we\u2019re interested in making sure that Polkadot Runtime doesn\u2019t misbehave with any input conditions possible (paying most attention to the inputs which can be potentially under attackers\u2019 control, i.e. transactions executed in the Runtime).We can (non-exhaustively!) separate potential misbehaviors into two major classes: performing unauthorized actions and denial of service.Performing unauthorized actionsThe worst-case scenario in this category would be an attacker gaining control over the whole Runtime, for example by exploiting vulnerabilities in the Runtime upgrade module and forcing all the nodes to accept the compromised update. But the class itself is of course wider than that, and potential threats also include attacker being able to modify storage in a way which was not intended, bypass authorisation of other protected functions of the Runtime, violating invariants which are assumed to be true during Runtime invocation and so on.Denial of serviceThis category covers any situation in which Polkadot Runtime ceases to execute blocks, be it because of putting the chain into illegal state with no recourse, provoking unbounded work (not necessary an infinite loop, just an unexpectedly heavy set of computations which might lead to block producer and consumer nodes \u201cbeing late\u201d for their other duties), or some other reasons.DeliverablesThe chosen auditor(s) shall supply W3F with an audit report of the PR as implemented in Substrate by Parity Technology. The final format and content of the audit report will evolve over the life of the audit. It is expected that the auditors work closely with Web3 Foundation and Parity Technologies during the audit.The audit report should focus on delivering an analysis and evaluation of the security of implementation of the above mentioned layers. Specifically we want to understand the threat model as well as specific issues that result from it.Ideally, the report follows in its sections the breakdown of the above-mentioned components, namely:Runtime Module Framework sectionIndividual Module sectionsSelection criteriaThe selection of the auditor(s) is based on the received proposal as evaluated according to W3F\u2019s own understanding. W3F may contact third parties to request references or request additional information from the bidder.The following criteria will be taken into account when selecting the auditor(s). It is expected that proposals will include all of the information below. When experience is asked for, this applies to both the proposing auditing company or team as a whole, as well as the individual members of the team.Experience in auditing large codebasesExperience with distributed systems and cryptographyExperience with the Rust programming languageExperience with auditing blockchain technologyAny planned usage of subcontractors or other external assistanceExpected timelineAll-in cost of the audit, including a detailed breakdown of resources and expensesTimeline and ProcessUpon receipt of this document, bidders are requested to confirm their intention to attend a pre-bid call for clarification of questions (Zurich time).Any timelines listed for the auditor activity are just a suggestion and may be reasonably extended within the proposal. Please note than any extensions to the final report deadline, needs to be agreed upon with W3F no later than 2 weeks prior to the final report deadlineConclusionWe are looking to build long-term relationships with auditors who can work proactively with us on the security of Polkadot Runtime as well as other Web3 technologies.If you are interested please send us an email to audit@web3.foundation with your proposal and we will reach out to you to arrange a conversation.

Well, you\u2019ve come to the right place! We\u2019ve tried to keep this fairly non-technical. However, if anything is unclear or you need any support, head over to the Forum where the team and community will be ready and waiting to answer your questions.Data TypesWe\u2019ve implemented the 8 data types as defined in the Data Types RFC\u2019s(0054 and 0055) which can, very simply, be categorised into Public (or Published) and Private (or Unpublished). We\u2019ve got a standalone post which explains these types in more detail but in essence, they give every user ultimate control over how to maintain his or her data.Public data is the content you publish to the Network that everyone can see it. This is the Perpetual Web in action. Private data, on the other hand, is slightly more nuanced and brings to life the concepts around Take Control of Your Data that you might have heard us discuss before.Test SafecoinWe\u2019ve implemented the basic functions defined in the Safecoin RFC (including creating balances, coin transfers, and transactions).SAFE CLIThe CLI (Command Line Interface) provides many of the commands necessary to interact with the SAFE Network, including storing and browsing, finding data and using Wallet-related commands. It is worth noting that while we\u2019re implementing all the data types, the CLI will only use a selected range (see later in this post).At this point, we\u2019re showcasing functionality. We haven\u2019t implemented a GUI because we want to let you get closer to the action and interact with a greater degree of control without having to navigate around a GUI. This makes it perfect for developers, as you will have the permission to access many of the operations that can be made on SAFE Network data. It will allow you to also use it for automated scripts in a piped chain of commands, for example.By developing the Network in this way, we\u2019re able to decouple the GUI development from the back-end functionality of those GUI apps. With the CLI and its API being separate, we can test the operations needed to manipulate data on the Network more efficiently, by having automated tests and by using the CLI itself. Once this layer is solid and stable, developing a GUI is a more straightforward task (as the expected underlying functionality has been validated).So what can the CLI do?First off, the CLI needs to be authorised by you before it can access your account. Therefore, you\u2019ll need to first authenticate yourself via the SAFE Authenticator CLI (all the details can be found here).Currently, you can use the following data types:Create files (via the PublishedImmutable data type)Set up NRS (PublishedAppendOnly)Access a Wallet and its commands (UnpublishedAppendOnly)Creating filesAs we\u2019ve mentioned, you can upload files to these Vaults. We\u2019ve got a super-clear guide here on how to do this, as well as details of what you can do with your data once it has been uploaded. But here\u2019s a quick overview here of how it works\u2026Data is uploaded to the Vaults and stored as Published ImmutableData files (head to this post for all the details on the different data type). That data is stored in a container which maps the data path together with the corresponding ImmutableData NRS (more details below). And this map is stored on the Vault within a special container called FilesContainer, which is stored as Published AppendOnlyData data. Simples!NRSNRS means Name Resolution System. The easiest way to think about it is how SAFE lets you have human-readable URLs.Each piece of data on the Vault is held in a unique location with an associated XOR address name. This data can be accessed using the XOR address as a URL. Hence XOR-URL. We have been working on developing a more human-friendly URL system that can be easily remembered when trying to share them with other people or recognised quickly. Just like URLs on the current Internet today.As an example, compare a XOR \u2014 URL (safe://sadoiofsefohf89243hf9huheofhdoih289euhfafoishaoifdha893f2fh9eahfoiasef) with an NRS URL (safe://maidsafe). This human-friendly naming system can be used not just to find data on the Vault but also can be used as a URL to enable the sourcing of websites, web applications, files and folders. It can even be used in Safecoin wallets for receiving transfers, SAFE IDs, etc in a memorable format.Details on how to create your own NRS and how to work with others can all be found here.WalletsAs part of this release, we\u2019ve included the Wallet in this CLI, which is a type of Container. A Container in this context means a structure to hold data (kind of like a folder). The Wallet holds your secret keys, which enable you to spend your Safecoin. The Wallet also holds the links to your SafeKeys, which holds your Safecoins. And importantly, everything that is stored in the Wallet is only accessible by you, the owner.Details on how to set up your very own Wallet, as well as adding test Safecoins, view your balance and make transfers can be found over here, as well as setting up your Keys.And that\u2019s it! Next up, Phase 2. This will see the introduction of PARSEC, swiftly followed up by Phase 3 and 4 which will be iterative versions of the testnet, ultimately ending up in the implementation of Routing and, then\u2026we have a Network!

Building Dapps on ethereum are cool, though they come with some infrastructure setup drawbacks. You need to set up an ethereum node to interact with the blockchain and this setup needs time, infra and skills. QuikNode solves this problem by providing Ethereum node as Service. As QuikNode website quotes:\u201cThe fastest and easiest way to run your own Ethereum node.\u201dWhy you should use QuikNode?Running your own private Ethereum node is cumbersome. There are three problems with that:Infra \u2014 Blockchains are distributed Ledgers and a full node means the entire copy of the ledger, that maybe not possible on the home computer anymore as ethereum blockchain size is around 670 GB now, even fast sync is now around 120 GB.Time \u2014 First time syncing takes time and syncing ethereum main net can take days, depending on the internet speed.Skills \u2014 The most concerning part is the security of the node. You need to have some cybersecurity skills to secure your node.What QuikNode provides?QuikNode solves this problem by providing you a full node on a click of a button. Instead of using shared public nodes, QuikNode provides you a dedicated node. QuikNode is optimized for performance, speed, and flexibility. Let's see how QuikNode achieves this.Dedicated Node- With the use of dedicated nodes helps you increase performance for your blockchain queries as it\u2019s only taking queries for your DApp.Multiple Zones- QuikNode supports 8 different Zones. That helps in optimizing networks call time which boosts speed and performance for your DApp.Multiple Testnet support \u2014 QuikNode support almost all famous ethereum testnets. That gives immense flexibility to a developer by testing application on their preferred testnet.Archive Nodes \u2014 QuikNode provide Parity archive nodes too. An archive node keeps full copy of blockchain ledger in comparison to full nodes who may do pruning for obvious infra reasons. This is very important feature for businesses benefit from blockchain analysis and research. You can learn more about QuikNode archive nodes here.Also, QuikNode support Parity and Geth both client. Isn\u2019t it cool? \ud83d\ude03Signing up with QuikNodeLet\u2019s sign up for the QuikNode, Don\u2019t forget to store your password as you will need it to access your node and also QWallet.

Create a project directory and run below commands.mkdir quiknodecd quiknodenpm initnpm install web3Setup Web3 using QuikNodeLet\u2019s create an Index.js file and setup web3. As you can see we add using QuikNode HttpProvider link. We will connect to our node using this link. Now all the commands we will run will be going through this node and will use Kovan Network.const Web3 = require('web3')const httpProvider = \"https://mistakenly-smart-jay.quiknode.io/86d9e35e-8cdb-47ad-80a4-84f9e9537afa/C0_tKUunhUc0rM_i1HMxHA==/\"var web3 = new Web3(new Web3.providers.HttpProvider(httpProvider));To test the network add these line and check the network id, Kovan network Id is 42.web3.eth.net.getId(function(err, data){console.log(data);})Creating an accountLet\u2019s create a new ethereum account on Kovan network.var addressData =web3.eth.accounts.create(web3.utils.randomHex(32));console.log(addressData);This will give us a private key and address, using which we will create a raw transaction.You can check the balance using belowweb3.eth.getBalance('0x75E18d32f2DbEEfaF4055aD709BDe98eCB57C379', (err, wei) => {balance = web3.utils.fromWei(wei, 'ether')console.log(balance);});Signing an Ethereum transactionLet\u2019s get some Test ethers using Kovan network faucet and sign a transaction. Ethier, you can generate a new address as a recipient or just use any address from Kovan block explorer.web3.eth.accounts.signTransaction({    from: address, // our address     to: address2, // any other kovan network address you want to send     value: '2000000000000000',    gas: '8000000'}, privateKey, function(err, data) {    console.log(data);});Sending transactionNow let\u2019s broadcast this signed transaction using QuikNode.web3.eth.accounts.signTransaction({    from: address,    to: address2,    value: '2000000000000000',    gas: '8000000'}, privateKey, function(err, data) {    web3.eth.sendSignedTransaction(data.rawTransaction, function(err, receipt) {        console.log(\"receipt\", receipt);        web3.eth.getTransaction(receipt, function(err, data) {            console.log(\"transaction\", data);        })    });});We have successfully sent a transaction using QuikNode on Kovan network, you can check this transaction on Kovan block explorer.Using WebSockets with QuikNodeQuikNode supports WebSockets too. You can find a web socket connection link under Dev Tools. Either you can use it with HTTPs Auth or Token Auth. Token auth link will look like something below.- Token auth: wss://mistakenly-smart-jay.quiknode.io/86d9e35e-8cdb-47ad-80a4-84f9e9537afa/C0_tKUunhUc0rM_i1HMxHA==/WebSockets allow both the server and the client to push messages at any time without any relation to a previous request as opposed to HTTP where the client creates a connection with the server every time. In WebSocket connection get created once, server and client push messages using the connection. Websockets are best for an event-based system. Websockets are supported by almost every browser.Image sourceSubscribing pending Transaction eventsLet\u2019s subscribe pending transaction of Ethereum blockchain. You can see we are passing QuikNode WebSocket URI while initializing web3.const Web3 = require('web3')const webSocket = \"wss://mistakenly-smart-jay.quiknode.io/86d9e35e-8cdb-47ad-80a4-84f9e9537afa/C0_tKUunhUc0rM_i1HMxHA==/\"var web3 = new Web3(webSocket);var subscription = web3.eth.subscribe('pendingTransactions', function(error, result) {        if (!error)            console.log(result);    })    .on(\"data\", function(transaction) {        console.log(transaction);    });QuikNode with TruffleLet\u2019s see how we\u2019ll use QuikNode with Truffle and deploy smart contracts. So for that lets download Truffle Petshop. We will simply unbox it and deploy it using QuikNode.truffle unbox pet-shop We will use truffle-HD-wallet to deploy our pet-shop smart contracts. So you need to install it too.npm install truffle-hdwallet-providerNow let\u2019s see the configuration of our Truffle\u2019s config. We will simply add HttpProvider URI to use QuikNode as mentioned below.var HDWalletProvider = require(\"truffle-hdwallet-provider\");var mnemonic = \"YOUR_MEMONICS\"; // use a funded walletmodule.exports = {    networks: {        development: {            host: \"127.0.0.1\",            port: 7545,            network_id: \"*\" // Match any network id        },        kovan: {            provider: function() {                return new HDWalletProvider(mnemonic, \"https://mistakenly-smart-jay.quiknode.io/86d9e35e-8cdb-47ad-80a4-84f9e9537afa/C0_tKUunhUc0rM_i1HMxHA==/\")            },            network_id: 42        }    }};QuikNode Stats FeaturesSo now let's talk about QuikNode\u2019s Stat feature which gives you visibility what's happening with your Dapp.Stats / Node Peers / Node Logs \u2014 QuikNode provides different types of stats, by which you can measure your Dapps Usage.

Protocols are allowing people to lend and borrow tokens trustless via smart-contracts. In the last article, we talked about MakerDao and Dai JS (also fueling open and decentralized finance [#DeFi]). In this article, we will deep-dive into Compound Protocol and see how we can build Web3 applications on top of it.What is Compound?Compound Protocol enables trust-less borrowing and lending on the Ethereum Protocol.\u201cCompound is a money market protocol on the Ethereum blockchain \u2014 allowing individuals, institutions, and applications to frictionlessly earn interest on or borrow cryptographic assets without having to negotiate with a counterparty or peer\u201d. [1]How Compound Protocol Works?The Compound Protocol (like any other protocol built on top of Ethereum) is a collection of Smart Contracts. Any individual can lock their Ether (also other assets) into Compound Protocol\u2019s smart contract, this is what we call supply, and borrowers can borrow this supply at some interest rate. Let\u2019s look at an example.Let's say Ether (ETH) price is $200 and DAI is $1. Now you want to borrow 100 DAI, so you put $150 worth of ETH as collateral and receive 100 DAI. You need to pay an annual interest rate on the borrowed 100 DAI. When you pay back 100 DAI, you will get your collateral back.Note- Compound team has launched V2 where this 150% collateral is now calculated on every asset (it means there will be different collateral for borrowing different assets).Now if you don\u2019t want to borrow and instead have some extra ETH (also other tokens supported by the protocol) lying around, you can earn interest by providing your asset as Supply to the Compound Protocol. You will earn an annual interest based on the supply you provide.Where does the interest come from?When one borrows from Compound, she needs to pay interest according to the interest rate (at the time of borrowing). Of this interest rate, Compound takes 5\u201310% (aka. sponsor equity) and the rest is spread out among suppliers.If you have more questions about, quickly read this FAQs.Now enough of economics, let's talk some code!We will talk about Compound v2 which is still not on the main net, instead working on a testnet.cTokensLet\u2019s first understand the cToken: these are simply ERC20 tokens for real assets on the Compound protocol. So if you want to use ZRX, Compound will wrap them into cToken and make it cZRX. There will be a separate contract for every asset. So to create borrowing and lending, we need these cTokens.Now a deep-dive into the code: in this tutorial, we will borrow DAI and put ETH as collateral. Before that, a few things to note here:Full code is here.We are using Rinkeby testnet.I added my private keys and address so it will be easy for you to run and test this. (DO NOT POST YOUR PRIVATE KEY PUBLICLY EVER).You need a Web3 URL for accessing Rinkeby network (can spin up a QuikNode and get it here).This Documentation, which we\u2019ll reference often throughout the article.Now let\u2019s understand what we\u2019re actually doing here. We need to have a cToken contract for ETH and DAI, which are cETH and cDAI. We will also need another contract called Comptroller, which manages the risk associated with the Compound Protocol v2. It is responsible for determining when accounts are underwater and can be liquidated. It determines how much collateral can be seized in exchange for liquidating an underwater account. It also provides a defense mechanism to protect the protocol against unforeseen attacks on the market.let cETH =\"0xbed6d9490a7cd81ff0f06f29189160a9641a358f\";let CEther = new web3.eth.Contract(abi, cETH);let cDAI = \"0x2acc448d73e8d53076731fea2ef3fc38214d0a7d\"let cDaiInstance = new web3.eth.Contract(daiAbi, cDAI);let comptroller = \"0x8d2a2836d44d6735a2f783e6418caedb86da58d8\";const troll = new web3.eth.Contract(trollAbi, comptroller);We need to mint some cETH so we can use them borrow on Compound. The Compound Protocol only recognizes these minted tokens.CEther.methods.mint().send({from: address, value: 2000000000000000000, gas : 2500000}).on('transactionHash', (hash) => {    console.log(\"hash\", hash)}).on('confirmation', (confirmationNumber, receipt) => {    console.log(\"confirmationNumber\", confirmationNumber)    console.log(\"receipt\", receipt)}).on('receipt', (receipt) => {    // receipt example    console.log(\"receipt\", receipt);}).on('error', console.error);Here we are minting cETH for 2 Ether. The mint function transfers an asset into the money market, which begins accumulating interest based on the current Supply Rate for the asset. The number of tokens minted is the amount of underlying assets being provided divided by the current Exchange Rate.Now we need to enable markets for both ETH and DAI tokens using the Comptroller Contract.troll.methods.enterMarkets([cETH, cDAI]).send({from: address  , gas : 2500000}).on('transactionHash', (hash) => {    console.log(\"hash\", hash)}).on('confirmation', (confirmationNumber, receipt) => {    console.log(\"confirmationNumber\", confirmationNumber)    console.log(\"receipt\", receipt)}).on('receipt', (receipt) => {    // receipt example    console.log(\"receipt\", receipt);}).on('error', console.error);Now let\u2019s borrow 5 DAI.cDaiInstance.methods.borrow(5).send({from: address , gas : 2500000}).on('transactionHash', (hash) => {    console.log(\"hash\", hash)}).on('confirmation', (confirmationNumber, receipt) => {    console.log(\"confirmationNumber\", confirmationNumber)    console.log(\"receipt\", receipt)}).on('receipt', (receipt) => {    // receipt example    console.log(\"receipt\", receipt);}).on('error', console.error);That\u2019s it, we borrowed 5 DAI! To see the balance:cDaiInstance.methods.borrowBalanceCurrent(address).call().then(result => {  console.log(result.toNumber() / 1E18) })Your homework is to follow the Compound v2 Docs and repay my debt. =)If you get stuck, start a discussion below \u2014 our community of peer Web3 devs is here to help!About QuikNodeQuikNode is building infrastructure to support the future of Web3.

Sometimes the easiest way to hack someone is through social hacking. A process through which, hackers socially engineer ways to exploit users into providing them with their account credentials.Over the past few days, hackers going by the hashtag #ChucklingSquad, have been hacking into popular twitter accounts including Twitter\u2019s CEO, Jack Dorsey, influencers such as Zane Hijazi, Zane and Heath podcast, and Anthony Brown, who goes by BigJigglyPanda and more. They even posted messages mocking popular YouTubers who have passed away.But how could this happen to one of the world\u2019s leading tech innovators? The fault is not with Twitter per se, nor with its CEO. Really it lies with the mobile telecommunications companies \u2014 in this case, AT&T. Hackers find it easier to attack their victims starting with the path of least resistance. With this hack, the weak link was AT&T and their process to port over phone numbers to a new SIM card.The hackers used a technique called a SIM Swap Attack, a well known exploit of the low-security methods telecom companies use for account recovery. It is executed by simply providing the customer support agent with the victim\u2019s date-of-birth and other similar identifiers that are often easily obtainable.Why is Twitter receiving so much heat over this attack if AT&T allowed the hack to occur? In order to understand why Twitter is to blame for the attacks on their CEO and users, we first must understand the decades of issues engineers have worked tirelessly to solve\u2026Netscape, the first web browser, was invented in the mid-1990's. It was also the first time we needed encryption, and later a way to send data, ie. credit card information, from one point to another point securely. The Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols were created to securely handle communications over the public Internet infrastructure.Secure communication in these protocols is achieved using asymmetric cryptography, commonly explained by the analogy of a padlock (the public key) and the key to unlock it (the private key). In practice these are both long strings of numbers that result from a cryptographic function.The locks are communicated over the protocol, essentially announcing \u201cmessages directed at me can be encrypted using this and only I will be able to read them\u201d. The problem, however, is that humans can\u2019t remember a long string of numbers for every service they want to log in to.The widely used solution is single-factor authentication. Users create a \u201cmemorable\u201d password upon sign-up to a service, and it\u2019s used as a seed to generate a lock and key. It is as intuitive as saying the secret code to be let through the door of a secret club.Passwords are too simple, though. People use passwords they can easily remember, often a combination of some word common to their lives (i.e. favorite holiday, birthday, wedding anniversary, etc.) resulting in guessable passwords such as\u2026May041995 or halloween17To make matters worse, laziness often results in the reusing of the same password for many services, exposing all accounts associated with it to each service\u2019s security vulnerabilities.This brings us to modern attempts to add layers of security. Multi-factor authentication methods such as SMS-based second-factor authentication (SMS 2FA) and software-based second-factor authentication applications (Google Authenticator App, Duo, Authy, etc.) were invented to add a layer of security for the end-user.Problem solved. Yes? \u2014 Well, No. While multi-factor authentication does technically work, it adds such a higher barrier to usability that users have not adopted the process. Little adoption = a failed methodology.Why is it Twitter\u2019s fault at all?Authentication is difficult, and because of that, users seldom follow the recommended processes for securing their accounts and/or account credentials. Twitter and many other Web 2.0 applications have been trying to increase security for users.One attempt to improve security is the aforementioned SMS-based second-factor verification. Unlike its close cousin, software-based authenticators, SMS-based second-factor authentication is friendlier to users as it allows users to access codes via convenient SMS messages.The trouble with SMS second-factor authentication is that hackers know that they can access user accounts by gaining access to the user\u2019s phone number. Twitter, one of the world\u2019s leading technology\u2019s influencing politics, sports, breaking news, and more, is fully aware of this. They employ some of the world\u2019s top engineers who have not only studied these well-known exploits. In fact, Twitter\u2019s first engineer, Blaine Cook, was one of the co-author\u2019s of OAuth and was working to solve some of these attack vectors back in 2006.Where do we go from here and what are some solutions?Twitter and other app developers can simply remove the feature and no longer offer users the option to use SMS second-factor authentication. But this brings us right back to using only passwords, and with that the plethora of problems they bring.The decentralized web or Web 3.0 has brought an even more complex security model, forcing us to revisit the authentication process in its entirety. The irrevocable nature of blockchain transactions requires higher security than that which passwords can provide, bringing us back to the problem of managing private keys. Moreover, the decentralized nature of these systems complicates the recovery of lost keys by removing the authority which could previously reset users\u2019 credentials (though, at the benefit of not requiring said authority\u2019s trust).The biggest hindrance to the growth of Web 3.0 to date is that users have to either remember 24-word mnemonic phrases or write them down in order to recover their account(s) for when they are required. Although this is a much worse user experience, it is in this key recovery process that lays the secret to providing a much better solution to authentication (login).Possible Solution: A decentralized login (DLI) and decentralized private key recovery platformOne of the best login experiences to date is single sign-on (SSO), \u201cSign in with Facebook, Twitter, Google, etc.\u201d Users do not have to devise passwords, or go through the sign-up process for services. Great experience? Yes. The trouble with SSO with Facebook is that then you\u2019re logging in with Facebook and logging in with Facebook gives them the opportunity to collect your data.However, these services are still based on passwords, in addition to serving as honeypots for data leaks. Moreover, integration is usually conditioned on data sharing policies, ensuring Facebook, Google, or whoever have access to all of your browsing data from any website implementing SSO.How do we achieve such an experience using a more secure set of tools? One such way could be a framework for managing these keys in a manner which is seamless to the user and painless for web developers to implement and support. A service that would run locally, rather than on a remote server, protecting from both data leaks and censorship.Services such as SSH have used private keys to authenticate for years, and with the rise of secure enclaves on smartphones we now can leverage them for added security of storage. It can be exposed to websites through a simple API, allowing any web developer to add support for a better authentication scheme.The real challenge in this proposed framework is recovering lost keys securely. Recovery is hard because you need to allow for a spectrum of use cases and security models. Do users want to go through a complicated KYC verification process to recover their social media credentials? Probably not. Are they willing to go through a comprehensive process to ensure that only they can recover their cryptocurrency keys?Most likely, yes.Luckily, markets are very good tools at matching consumers to the service that fits their use case the most. In the context of credential recovery, we want to allow a user the ability to select any provider that fits their needs, and be able to verify with them in order to recover the lost keys. The keys would be shared (but encrypted) on a decentralized protocol/network, and users would select the provider whose verification they will use in order to recover. Providers will provide a proof to the network, and the shards would be sent to the user for reconstruction.There is an open source community called Universe Labs, working on defining and building this decentralized login (DLI) framework and a decentralized private key recovery protocol. We\u2019d love for folks to join the open source community, commit some code, and assist the community in growing the decentralized Web 3.0 with a much better, more secure method of authentication, identity and key management.Comments?

Events subscriptions can be registered dynamically, and on emission, a message containing the details of the events are broadcast onto a message bus (currently either Kafka or RabbitMQ) which can then be consumed by your backend services.Eventeum is:Dynamically Configurable \u2014 Eventeum exposes a REST api so that smart contract events can be dynamically subscribed / unsubscribed.Highly Available \u2014 Eventeum instances communicate with each other to ensure that every instance is subscribed to the same collection of smart contract events.Resilient \u2014 Node failures are detected and event subscriptions will continue from the failure block once the node comes back online.Fork Tolerance \u2014 Eventeum can be configured to wait a certain amount of blocks before an event is considered \u2018Confirmed\u2019. If a fork occurs during this time, a message is broadcast to the network, allowing your services to react to the forked/removed event.[source]Deploying EventeumEventeum supports 3 broadcast mechanisms.KafkaHTTP PostRabbitMQWe will be using Kafka in our deployment.To deploy Eventeum, you need these things:PrerequisiteJava8MavenMongoKafkaZookeeperEthereum NodeDocker (optional)You can deploy Eventeum with or without docker. To get started I\u2019ll recommend docker all-in-one installation. It comes with all the dependencies mentioned above, though you still need to install Java8 and Maven (so install these first). I have installed both versions, with and without docker, but will mention docker all-in-one installation only as it is easy and you don\u2019t need a lot of setups.Installing Eventeum using DockerTo install Eventeum using Docker, you must have Docker and Docker-compose in your system. After installing them, follow below instructionsCheckout Eventeum Github Repo$ git clone https://github.com/ConsenSys/eventeum.gitAfter checking out the code, navigate to the root directory$ cd /path/to/eventeum/Compile, test and package the project$ mvn clean packageAll-in-one docker installation$ cd server$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml build$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml upOnce installed you can see logs in docker terminal.Note: You might need sudo depending on your docker installation.Testing EventeumFor this purpose, we will deploy a contract on our local parity node (already installed by Eventeum) and then will register an event subscription on Eventeum for Broadcasting via Kafka.Deploy contract on Local Parity nodeLet\u2019s Deploy a contract we already made in our previous tutorial. To deploy CrudApp.sol contract we will use Remix IDE and Metamask.Open Remix and add CurdApp.sol contractSelect proper compiler (0.4.23 in our case) and compile (Ignore warnings, if any \ud83d\ude03)On Metamask Select Localhost:8545In Remix, Go to Run Tab and select Web3 Provider in Environment and DeployThat\u2019s it you deployed the contract on your local Parity dev node.Register EventWe need to now Register events, so Eventeum can listen to those events and broadcast them. Eventeum exposes rest APIs for this purpose, we will use them.Register events API-URL: /api/rest/v1/event-filterMethod: POST{\t\"id\": \"event-identifier\",\t\"contractAddress\": \"0x1fbBeeE6eC2B7B095fE3c5A572551b1e260Af4d2\",\t\"eventSpecification\": {\t\t\"eventName\": \"TestEvent\",\t\t\"indexedParameterDefinitions\": [\t\t  {\"position\": 0, \"type\": \"UINT256\"},\t\t  {\"position\": 1, \"type\": \"ADDRESS\"}],\t\t\"nonIndexedParameterDefinitions\": [\t\t  {\"position\": 2, \"type\": \"BYTES32\"},\t\t  {\"position\": 3, \"type\": \"STRING\"}] },\t\"correlationIdStrategy\": {\t\t\"type\": \"NON_INDEXED_PARAMETER\",\t\t\"parameterIndex\": 0 }}To make our life simple, we will simply do a curl call. As you can see below, we are using localhost:8060 (on which, Eventeum is running) and you need to add the address for your deployed smart contract from Remix. We are currently registering CountryEvent from our smart contract which gets emitted on insert transaction.curl -X POST \\http://localhost:8060/api/rest/v1/event-filter \\-H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' \\-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\-H 'Postman-Token: 616712a3-bf11-bbf5-b4ac-b82835779d51' \\-d '{\"id\": \"Country\",\"contractAddress\": \"ENTER_YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_CHECK_IN_REMIX\",\"eventSpecification\": {  \"eventName\": \"CountryEvent\",  \"nonIndexedParameterDefinitions\": [    {\"position\": 0, \"type\": \"STRING\"},    {\"position\": 1, \"type\": \"STRING\"},    {\"position\": 2, \"type\": \"UINT256\"}] }}'If registered successfully, you will get your ID (Country in our case) back as a response. Now Let\u2019s do an insert transaction which will emit our CountryEvent. For this purpose, we\u2019ll use Remix again, using remix, you can call your contract functions.You can see our CrudApp.sol contract address and also functions exposed by the contract, you can call it from here only.So Now, Let\u2019s put these 3 things in insert function (\u201cUSA\u201d, \u201cElizabeth Warren \u201d, 327946410), if everything went well, you will be able to see the transaction in Docker terminal.Subscribing Eventeum events in NodeJs serviceNow let\u2019s subscribe Kafka events using a NodeJs service. This will help you to a clear picture about how you can use Eventeum with your application. For this follow these steps.mkdir watchercd watchernpm initnpm installnpm i kafka-node  (Kafka-nodejs client)touch index.jsNow add below code in index.jsvar kafka = require('kafka-node')const client = new kafka.KafkaClient({kafkaHost: 'localhost:9092'});var kafka = require('kafka-node'),    Consumer = kafka.Consumer,    // client = new kafka.Client(),    consumer = new Consumer(        client,        [            { topic: 'contract-events', partition: 0 }        ],        {            autoCommit: false        }    );consumer.on('message', function (message) {    console.log(message);});You can run this usingnodejs index.jsTo test this, again do an insert transaction using remix and you will able to see console output for the event.As you can see we are using the topic as \u2018contract-events\u2019, this is already inbuilt in Eventeum, to check all the topics defined by Eventeum.bin/kafka-topics.sh --list --zookeeper localhost:2181As you are using docker installation you need to go inside the docker and run the above command, though you need to change the /bin/kafka-topics.sh with actual installation path in docker. Eventeum already create below topics__consumer_offsetsblock-eventscontract-eventsfilter-eventsfilter-events-dlteventeumfilter-events-erreventeumfilter-eventsnullHere block-events track new block generations.You can see more details here about Eventeum and learn more about it.How to Use Eventeum on TestNet or MainNet?To use Eventeum with Testnet or Mainnet you need to change Ethereum node URL in docker-compose.yml.As I am facing problem with Infura\u2019s eth_newBlockFilter api used by Eventeum, you can use QuikNode for this purpose.QuikNode provides fast Ethereum nodes, combined with Eventeum you can monitor smart contract events reliably.Please take 5 minutes to fill below this Ethereum Node Survey \ud83d\ude4f \ud83d\udc47About QuikNodeQuikNode is building infrastructure to support the future of Web3.

The portion of tokens each purchaser must use, and what they have to do in order to \u2018prove use\u2019, depends on the USD($) amount of tokens purchased in the sale as outlined below:Small Buyers (below $10,000):1. must use at least 25% of FOAM tokens purchased in the token sale2. must add at least 10 points of interest to the mapLarge Buyers (above $10,000):1. must use at least 50% of FOAM tokens purchased in the token sale2. must add at least 10 points of interest to the mapThere is a module in the app to query the Token Controller to see if you have fulfilled Proof of Use.Points of InterestAt the time this post was written, 492 users have created 6050 points of interest globally as part of the initial use period. These points have been added across all tag categories (see breakdown below). It\u2019s been great to see that the new tag categories, as proposed through a voting process on our community forum, are embraced and used by the community.Point of Interest tagsThe distribution of POIs has happened globally, much in line with the distribution of token purchasers in our initial token sale.Top 10 clusters of points of interestWe want to share two further insights about POI creation (supported by Blocklytics):The first is about the mechanics around user challenges in the point of interest token curated registry. Interestingly, only a small percentage of points get challenged, and almost all of those get removed from the map after the challenge. One can presume this means that almost all points that get challenged are actually faulty.The second insight is that even though the initial token purchasers need to place points of interest to unlock their tokens as part of \u2018proof of use\u2019, many users placed more than the 10 points required (marked in yellow, below). And while have been community discussions around the need for incentivisation for POI creation, for a big part of our community, the current incentive models are sufficient (or so it seems).SignalingSince the launch of signaling one week ago, there are now already over 7,000,000 FOAM Tokens staked in the signaling contract, making up a total of 479 Signals.

If you are into crypto, then you\u2019re probably familiar with Decentralized Exchanges and Protocols. Let\u2019s explore how Ethereum\u2019s DEX ecosystem is performing now!Where CEXs (Centralized Exchanges) have Trillions of dollars (USD) in monthly volume, DEXs are still struggling with liquidity. For example, in the last 7 days, DEXs had 108 Million dollars in volume. Compare this to CEX\u2019s more than 80 Billion dollars 24-hour volume \ud83d\ude33TerminologyDEX protocol \u2014 a protocol supporting multiple tokens with order books (e.g. 0x protocol)DEX \u2014 a stand-alone Decentralized ExchangeToken Swap Service \u2014 Swap tokens without order books (e.g. Uniswap, Kyber), or assist in only 1 single pair trade (Eth2Dai) with order books.Tl:dr;IDEX is a clear winner in DEX trading volumeToken swap protocols are doing betterDEX protocols (such as 0x) having a hard time in terms of adoptionNote \u2192Data shows \u201cMarket Matching Protocol\u201d which is \u201cOasisDex\u201d and now it\u2019s Eth2Dai.Trade Distribution Among Different Ethereum ExchangesIDEX takes a clear lead when it comes to the number of trades among different exchanges. IDEX is a semi-DEX \u2014 with off-chain order books & order matching, and on-chain settlement. But when it comes to Trade amount, Matching Market (Which is Eth2Dai) are doing better than IDEX. As the name suggests, Eth2Dai only facilitates ETH \u2194\ufe0f DAI exchange. This shows that a lot of traders are converting their Ether into Dai Stablecoin, and vice versa.Trade Distribution Among Different Ethereum ProtocolsHere, IDEX also takes the lead, but token swap protocols like Uniswap, Bancor and Kyber are also getting good traction. However, most of these services are not actually DEXs, as they do not host order books. Overall, DEX protocols (like 0x protocol) are still having a hard time gaining adoption.In Terms of the USD amount clearly, ETH \u2194\ufe0f DAI pair is a clear winner with 76 Million USD in volume. The real contrast here is that among the top 4, there are 3 token swap services (Eth2Dai, Uniswap, Kyber), and IDEX is the only actual \u201cDEX\u201d. 0x is in 5th place with 27 Million in volume.Market ShareIDEX holds more than 50% market share. Various token swap services hold around 33% market share. Two different versions of 0x protocol hold only ~7.6% market share. This shows that there is good demand for token swap services as they are more secure, cheaper and reliable than centralized token swap services like Shapeshift and Changelly.Top Tokens Traded on DEX (excluding ETH/WETH)The major currency traded is Ether and its derivative tokens \u2014 ETH and WETH. The most common transaction is an exchange of Ether (in the form of a token or ETH currency) to or from another token.Other than ETH and WETH, Dai is the top-traded coin on DEXs. One more interesting fact is that around 15% of all trades on DEXs involves tokens which are not listed on any CEX, only on these DEXs. Example, EMPR is only listed in 3 exchanges \u2014 of which 2 are DEXs.Note: Dai volume doesn\u2019t indicate that Dai is getting used for trading, this data involves Eth2Dai.ConclusionThe data above shows that even after 2 years and millions of dollars in funding, decentralized exchange protocols are still fighting to overtake CEXs and offer the same level of functionality, liquidity, and service. That said, there is progress; token swap protocols are doing better and gaining traction.If you\u2019ve ever used Uniswap or Kyber, you will clearly see the difference how making a token swap service decentralized leads to a better user-experience and efficient exchange. But this is not true in case of DEXs. We need Decentralize Exchanges to integrate efficient market making and Algo trading software without wasting a ton of money on Gas (cost of making a change to the Ethereum blockchain). Eth2.0\u2019s features aim to help DEX protocols in terms of transaction throughput and cost.IDEX is a clear winner because of its semi-centralized/decentralized model, where you need to deposit tokens on IDEX\u2019s Smart Contract w/ settlements on-chain, but everything else goes from IDEX\u2019s centralized servers and database.Decentralized Protocol projects such as 0x (ZRX) and Loopring (LRC) have been working hard. Recently, Loopring patented several solutions for the front-running problem and introduced zkSnarks to increase transaction throughput (in an effort to solve the liquidity problem). The 0x team is also experimenting with Starks to solve the liquidity problem. We think that with time, these projects will solve these problems and continue to move DEXs towards the same functionality and efficiency of CEXs.Decentralization is not the value proposition and projects already understand it. You can\u2019t sell inefficient products in the name of idealist values, no one cares \ud83e\uddd0#DeFi is on the MoveDecentralized Finance is growing exponentially and we\u2019ll dig more into DeFi stats in the next article, so make sure you subscribe to our newsletter below!About QuikNodeQuikNode is building infrastructure to support the future of Web3.

First, here is a link to the demo, go ahead and upload your own image file to see how Textile transforms, structures, and stores your data over IPFS.Let\u2019s just walk through the steps of what happens.A developer decides to use the Textile library to store and share data on a user\u2019s behalf.In their app, the developer can define any number of Threads where data will be stored and read. Threads are similar to a decentralized table, giving the app a simple way to coordinate data across devices, services, or users with permission to access the Thread.For each app, the developer can define the Schema of the data being stored, including formats, re-sampling, encryption, validation, and other steps and variations.Each time the app adds data to that Thread, the data will be transformed and stored in a predictable way for all other devices, services, and users who have access to the Thread.With those simple steps, an app is able to create valuable data to store for users while ensuring that the data is valuable in the app and potentially for other apps. The use of content addressing makes it so data existing in multiple Threads isn\u2019t duplicating storage or transfer costs, and means that two different applications could even build on top of each others\u2019 Threads.We use these steps in Textile Photos to create many distinct Threads for users to post and share photos. Each Thread uses a regular schema that basically says,Save the raw imageExtract the EXIF as a JSON fileSave a few down sampled copies of the fileEncrypt each file before adding it to IPFSWith that, every client or future interface can enter a Thread and know how to read the data coming out of the hose. What\u2019s even more exciting is that a developer could piggy-back off Textile Photos to build any number of services or applications to add value to a user\u2019s photo data. All they need to do is create an interface for users to grant permissions and manage access. Take a look at a couple fun demos:Publish and subscribe to real-time weather data over IPFS.Synchronize encrypted log data across trusted devices.Integrate (encrypted) Textile data feeds with external tools.Take a look at the demo and let us know what you think! You can reach out over Twitter or Slack, or pull us aside the next time you see us at a conference or event. We\u2019re happy to provide background on the demo, and where we\u2019re headed next.

Sounds familiar?Computes Inc.\u2019s peer-to-peer, encrypted, computing technology appears to be at the center of this movement. In addition to solving supercomputing and ambient computing demands for large enterprise companies, Computes is basically a decentralized operating system and computing platform allowing developers to build next generation decentralized apps (DApps) and Web 3.0 solutions perfect for disrupting these 800-pound, old-world incumbent companies.As a reminder, the Computes platform does not use decade-old blockchain technology. Instead, Computes was architected to run as a next generation DAG-based DLT and decentralized queuing technology. We affectionately call our DLT and queue technology, Lattice. Lattice frees us from the slow Bitcoin/Ethereum transaction speeds and the wasted PoW mining and the requirement that every node must maintain the entire ledger. Nodes on the Computes network can come and go at will and connect, communicate, and compute on demand. This design enables cooperative computing everywhere and opens doors for many new decentralization start-up ideas that address the cypherpunk culture and movement.To highlight some of these new blockchain 2.0 and web 3.0 ideas and use cases, we have developed Arpadyne to showcase a new peer-to-peer Internet platform with no cloud, no web servers, and no DNS. We have also demonstrated how decentralized APIs could work on a decentralized computing platform.We should all be welcoming (and bracing ourselves for) the huge shift coming in decentralized peer-to-peer computing-powered startups. New companies such as D.Tube will rival YouTube with new peer-to-peer video streaming and no censorship.Filecoin, Storj, and Sia will rival Box, DropBox, Google Drive, and AWS S3 storage incumbents.Computes will rival the existing AWS and Azure cloud computing incumbents by enabling companies to leverage their idle computing capacity in their data centers, workstations/laptops, mobile devices, and edge networks.Everyday consumers will soon be able to participate in all of these decentralized networks by donating or renting their excess computing power and/or free storage to certain causes or to customers willing to pay for these decentralized services.Welcome to the brave new cypherpunk world!Learn more about the Computes vision.

This is not an issue of credit rating, the United States can pay any debt it has because we can always print money to do that. So, there is zero probability of default.\u201dCurrent Central Banking systems have the power to print money out of thin air and solving this issue was at the core of Bitcoin\u2019s creation. Now we have technologies which replicate the same systems, but in a more trust-less manner. For example, MakerDAO.First: What is MakerDao?The MakerDao project created the DAI stable token. A stable token is pegged to some fiat currency, which allows it to be a unit of account. Dai is a decentralized stable coin pegged to the US Dollar value (i.e. 1 Dai = $1).Think of Dai as an electronic dollar; a dollar on the Ethereum blockchain.Dai token governance depends on MKR token, which makes it a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), hence MakerDAO. At the time of writing this article, the DAI system is 150% collateralized \u2014 meaning to get 100 DAI you need at least $150 worth of Ether (ETH).What is CDP?A Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) is the only way to create DAI. According to MakerDao white paper:Anyone who has collateral assets can leverage them to generate Dai on the Maker Platform through Maker\u2019s unique smart contracts known as Collateralized Debt Positions. A Collateral Asset is a digital asset that the decentralized Maker Governance process has input into the system.In simple words, a CDP is a loan taken against a digital asset (such as Ether/ETH). When you open a CDP, the system will generate Dai.CDP using Dai JSNow let's play with Dai JS and create CDP using it. Before that, we need to perform a few steps:Generate address on Koven networkTo play with the dai.js let's create a brand new address on Koven network. We are going to use NodeJs, so install that first in case you don\u2019t have that.mkdir walletcd walletnpm i ethereumjs-wallet Now create a file app.js in the same wallet directory and paste below code.const Wallet = require('ethereumjs-wallet');const wallet = Wallet.generate();console.log(\"privateKey: \" , wallet.getPrivateKeyString());console.log(\"address: \" , wallet.getAddressString());Now open the terminal and run node app.js , That\u2019s it, you have made an Ethereum private key with a public address.Import address to MetamaskNext, we will import this address to Metamask so things become easy (You will see this later).To import address follow these steps-Click on Metamask and select Koven networkThen click on the top right circle and click on Create Account optionThen click on import and paste your Private keys (generated above)Now let get some test ETH from Kovan Faucet using this site.Dai JSCurrent MakerDao enables you to do the following:Opening and closing CDPsLocking and unlocking collateralWithdrawing and repaying DaiAutomated token conversionsToken contract functionality for WETH, PETH, MKR, Dai, and ETHBuying and selling MKR and Dai with built-in DEX integrationMakerDao already created a GitHub repo, with different examples, which we forked. So let\u2019s import the repo using below commands:cd && git clone https://github.com/buddies2705/integration-examplesThis Repo has the following type of examples:CDP creation and fulfillmentHardware wallet integration examples such as Ledger and TezosLeverage (Similar to margin trading, Create CDP-> Get DAI -> Buy ETH on the exchange using DAI -> Repeat )Top up your CDPUsing Wyre to covert DAI into fiatA full example on how to create and close CDPIn this tutorial, we will look into the creating and closing CDP example, but before that let\u2019s run our application and see things in practice.First, let\u2019s add our private key in our code:cd integration-examples/react-examplecp .env.example .envThen add private keys in the .env file. We need a web3 provider to interact with Ethereum blockchain, so get your Web3 URL ready (we\u2019re going to use QuikNode \u2190 you sign up here):npm installnpm startThis will open a window on the browser. Make sure you have selected the correct Metamask account (account we recently added) and Kovan network above. Next open browser console using F12 and click on the start button. Now, wait you will see the following steps getting completed.Maker createdCDP openedEth LockedDai DrawnDebt WipedCDP ShutYou can see more output logs in the browser console.CDP in ActionBehind the SceneNow lets deep dive into the code and see what\u2019s happening. Open index.js in action folder.This is the main file where all the action is happening. You can see it\u2019s creating a Maker instance using our provided private key and network. Next, we are doing the following steps:maker.openCdp() \u2014 Get a CDP instancecdp.lockEth(0.01) \u2014 Locking 0.01 CDPdrawDaiAsync(maker, cdp) \u2014 Getting Dai for our locked Ether.const drawDaiAsync = (maker, cdp) => async dispatch => {//Getting default accountconst defaultAccount = maker.service('token')                            .get('web3').defaultAccount();//Getting tokenconst dai = maker.service('token').getToken('DAI');//Drawing CDPconst txn = await cdp.drawDai(0.1);//checking Dai balanceconst balance = await dai.balanceOf(defaultAccount);console.log('Transaction from drawing Dai:', txn);console.log('Dai balance after drawing:', balance.toString());dispatch(daiDrawn());};Here we have our DAI in our address. You can comment out the last 2 lines in case you don\u2019t want to close this CPD and check your balance here. Make sure that you have selected the Kovan network and correct account in Metamask.Next, you can see we are wiping out our debt using the last two lines.await dispatch(wipeDebtAsync(maker, cdp)) \u2014 This will wipe Dai in our wallet. When you close a CDP, those Dai tokens get burned.await dispatch(shutCdpAsync(cdp)) \u2014 Next, we can shut down our CDP.That\u2019s it! You have successfully created a CDP and closed it.A lot of things happened under the hood. Let\u2019s understand them.What happens when you create DAI?ETH get converted into WETH (Wrapped ETH). WETH is an ERC20 token in which 1ETH = 1WETH, and you can exchange them whenever you want.WETH gets converted into PETH (Pooled ETH), meaning it joins a large pool of ETH that is the collateral for all Dai created. This PETH actually gets locked in a smart contract which gets used to generate the CDP.Also, when you close a CDP, you need to pay a 1% annual fee in MKR token (Maker token) and a pre-decided stability fee in PETH (which is 11.5% now) against the loan value.You can check your balances here.Wrapping UpSo, in this article, we saw how to use Dai JS and play with CDP. There are a lot of things you can do using DaiJS, check developer docs here. Dai also has a DAI CLI which can be used to play with CDP.If a step wasn\u2019t clear and you\u2019d like us to go into greater detail, or you want to see more tutorials on Dai JS, let us know in comments!Open Finance Movement (#DeFi)Dai opens a lot of functionality. It is pegged to the US Dollar and programmable. With multi-collateral Maker, there will be many assets compatible with the MakerDao project. One can digitalize their GOLD or real estate and receive DAI. Globally, 1.7 billion adults remain unbanked, yet two-thirds of them own a mobile phone. You can imagine what Crypto can bring to those unbanked.\u201cBanking the Unbanked\u201dAbout QuikNodeQuikNode is building infrastructure to support the future of Web3.

Multiple smart contract languages are at the bleeding edge of innovation in competition to become mainstream. In addition to the well-known \u201cSolidity\u201d, there are several experimental languages targeting Ethereum:Bamboo \u2014 A morphing smart contract language (Not actively developed)Vyper \u2014 New experimental pythonic programming language (Actively developed)LLL \u2014 Low-level Lisp-like Language (Not actively developed)Flint \u2014 New language under development with security features including asset types, state transition, and safe integers (Actively developed)Pyramid \u2014 A dialect of the Scheme programming language that targets the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). (Not actively developed)What is Vyper?Vyper is an experimental smart contract language. It aims for simplicity, human readability, and security. Also, Vyper\u2019s syntax resembles Python.\u201cVyper is a contract-oriented, pythonic programming language that targets the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)\u201dLanguage Goals of VyperSimplicity \u2014 Vyper focuses on simplicity and maximizes the chances of writing error-free code. Its compiler implementation also strives for simplicity.Security & Audibility \u2014 Building secure contract comes naturally, that's what Vyper aims for; the code should have a natural reading flow for any reader. That's why Vyper encourages building one-page smart contracts. Code readability provides for better code audibility.Vyper Vs. SolidityVyper\u2019s goals as a language are different than those of Solidity. To achieve simplicity, readability, and audibility, Vyper doesn\u2019t include some of Solidity\u2019s features such as Modifiers and Inheritance. In addition, Vyper also doesn\u2019t include:Function overloadingOperator overloading (Solidity also doesn't support it as of 17 Jan 2018)Recursive callingInfinite-length loopsInline assemblyBinary fixed pointVyper scarifies all of the above to achieve it's design goals. However, Vyper does provide some interesting features :Bounds and overflow checking: On array accesses as well as on arithmetic level, which improves performance and increases reliability and security.Support for signed integers and decimal fixed point numbersDecidability: It should be possible to compute a precise upper bound for the gas consumption of any function call.Strong typing: Including support for units (e.g. timestamp, timedelta, seconds, wei, wei per second, meters per second squared).Small and understandable compiler codeLimited support for pure functions: Anything marked constant is not allowed to change the state.Among the above, decidability is a very important feature which you can use to estimate your upper bound of gas usage. This can help in gas optimization, which is a very important part of a smart contract platform.Installing VyperLet\u2019s get to it and install Vyper now. If you are running MacOS, check instructions here (I am running Ubuntu 16.10).Note- Vyper is in active development, so don\u2019t lose patience if you get installation errors. \ud83d\ude03Install Pythonsudo apt-get updatesudo apt-get install python3.6sudo apt-get install python3-devCreate Virtual EnvironmentIf you have worked with Python before then you must know about Virtual Python environment. It is strongly recommended to install Vyper in a Virtual Python environment.To create a new virtual environment for Vyper run the following commands:sudo apt install virtualenvvirtualenv -p python3.6 --no-site-packages ~/vyper-venvsource ~/vyper-venv/bin/activateYou must still be in the Virtual environment\u2026 now let\u2019s install Vyper:git clone https://github.com/ethereum/vyper.gitcd vypermakemake testIf everything went fine, then first thank to Byte God \ud83d\ude03 and compile an example contract:vyper examples/crowdfund.vyThere are many examples in the example folder of the installation directory.

We began the year enveloped in the chilly Crypto Winter that froze token holders in their seats. Low prices created the perfect environment for crypto-startups to gain greater focus, demonstrating product and market fit before raising money. This climate gave way to an incubation period that blossomed into #CryptoSpring.#ETHSommer by numbersThe Ethereum mainnet surpassed 500 million transactions on July 17th. Over 16 million unique addresses were added to Ethereum since the beginning of 2019. A record number of enterprises and governments are launching exploratory blockchain projects, and VC money has been flowing.VCs have invested just shy of $1 billion in blockchain startups in 2019, which is well on track to surpass 2018\u2019s record of $2.4 billion in VC investment. It\u2019s safe to say that ETHSommer is here.Celebrate #ETHSommer with Bounties NetworkThe Berlin bounty network was one of those projects that sparked within the Ethereum space, going from idea to creation in just four weeks back in August 2018. The community responded with a roaring \u201cJa!\u201d and a total of 2154 users accessed the Berlin network. There were over 120 bounty submissions for a total of 34 interactive bounties created by the different projects in our ecosystem.In the end, 52 people made it on the leaderboard having earnt exclusive BRLN coin tokens and won prizes courtesy of the ETHBerlin team.

First start up Ganache again and use Truffle to deploy the contract on it. Take note of the contract address, we will need this soon. If you don\u2019t know how to perform these steps, please review part 1 of this tutorial series.Now, we create a subdirectory named cli_app and enter the directory. Initialise the project:npm initSpecify the requested parameters whichever way you wish, but you may wish to choose app.js as an entry point, as that is what I have used.Next, install some library modules we require:npm install web3 --savenpm install jssha --savenpm install command-line-args --saveThe web3 library is what we will use to connect to our Ethereum node\u2019s RPC interface and communicate with the contract. Note, that at the time of writing this will install a beta version of the upcoming Web3 1.0 release. There have been many changes to the library\u2019s interface and the code of this tutorial will not work with previous versions.Also note, that we could use a higher level Truffle interface to connect to our contract, but we will use Web3 directly, because it gives more control and you can later use the same code in browser based web applications.jsSHA is a Javascript implementation of the SHA hashing algorithm family and command-line-args will help us to work with command line arguments.Let\u2019s create a module to interact with our contract in the cli_app directory with the following code:The first part or this code imports the library modules we need, and declares two variables to hold references to the connected web3 instance and the contract.We initialise the Ethereum node connection and the contract binding in the init() function. First of all we connect to the node:let provider = new Web3.providers.HttpProvider(\"http://localhost:8545\");web3 = new Web3(provider);Next, in order to create a proxy object for our contract, which we can use to execute the contract functions from Javascript, we need to know the address of the contract and the ABI:let abi = [    {      \"constant\": false,      \"inputs\": [        {          \"name\": \"hash\",          \"type\": \"bytes32\"        }      ],      \"name\": \"addDocHash\",      \"outputs\": [],      \"payable\": false,      \"stateMutability\": \"nonpayable\",      \"type\": \"function\"    },    {      \"constant\": true,      \"inputs\": [        {          \"name\": \"hash\",          \"type\": \"bytes32\"        }      ],      \"name\": \"findDocHash\",      \"outputs\": [        {          \"name\": \"\",          \"type\": \"uint256\"        },        {          \"name\": \"\",          \"type\": \"uint256\"        }      ],      \"payable\": false,      \"stateMutability\": \"view\",      \"type\": \"function\"    },    {      \"inputs\": [],      \"payable\": false,      \"stateMutability\": \"nonpayable\",      \"type\": \"constructor\"    }  ];let address = \"0xd121f94184Da71908123a1e08F72cAB8573b9363\";In the above code we have declared the ABI and address in the code. We could just read them from the JSON file created by Truffle in the build directory. Remember to replace the above address with the one assigned by your Ganache test blockchain.Finally, we create the contract object:contract = new web3.eth.Contract(abi, address);The calculateHash function does not require explaining as it reads the content of a file and then uses the calculateHashBytes helper function to actually calculate our hash value:function calculateHashBytes (data) {  let  shaObj = new jsSHA(\"SHA-256\", \"ARRAYBUFFER\");  shaObj.update(data);  let hash = \"0x\" + shaObj.getHash(\"HEX\");  return hash;};The above code uses the jsSHA library to calculate a SHA-256 hash value, which is provided in hexadecimal string representation. Note, that we add a leading \u201c0x\u201d, in order to have a string which can be recognised by Web3 as a HEX string, which can be automatically converted to the bytes32 Solidity type.Now we declare a function for sending a hash value to the contract:function sendHash (hash, callback) {    web3.eth.getAccounts(function (error, accounts) {      contract.methods.addDocHash(hash).send({        from: accounts[0]      },function(error, tx) {        if (error) callback(error, null);        else callback(null, tx);      });    });};There are a few things to note here:The function is asynchronous and uses nested callbacksWe access the addDocHash function through the methods field of the contract object.Calling the Javascript version of addDocHash returns a transaction objectWe send the transaction calling sendSend requires an options object as an argument, in which we specify the account to use as a sender address for our transaction. We use the first address in the accounts array.The existing accounts are obtained by the web3.eth.getAccounts call, which is the outer call in our callback structure.The function for verifying a hash value is similar:unction findHash (hash, callback) {  contract.methods.findDocHash(hash).call( function (error, result) {    if (error) callback(error, null);    else {      let resultObj = {        mineTime:  new Date(result[0] * 1000),        blockNumber: result[1]      }      callback(null, resultObj);    }  });};The main difference here is, that we do not need to create and send a transaction as the findDocHash function of our contract does not modify state and can be executed in a call instead of a transaction, i.e. the state can be read from our local Ethereum node\u2019s copy of the blockchain state.The rest of the code just exposes the modules interface and does not require explanation.We can now use our contract wrapper module to write our command line tool. The following is the complete source code:We will not discuss this code in detail, as all the Ethereum specific code is in our contract wrapper module and has already been explained.We can now store the hash value of a file by typing:node cli_app/app.js -a <filename>Similarly, we can verify a file\u2019s hash value using:node cli_app/app.js -f <filename>Running an Ethereum nodeLet\u2019s now deploy our contract on a real Ethereum blockchain. In order to deploy a contract a network we need to run some Ethereum node software.There are a few options to run your own Ethereum node. You may download the official Ethereum wallet, you may use the underlying geth command line node without graphical user interface, or you may use alternative software, such as Parity. We will will use the official geth reference implementation in this guide.You can download the software from the Ethereum web site at https://www.ethereum.org/cli. Follow the instructions for your system.In order to test our contract on a real network, but without real money we will use the Rinkeby test network.There are several test networks available. Rinkeby works only with geth and the official wallet (which uses geth below the hood), Kovan works only with Parity and Ropsten works with both. We are using Rinkeby in this case, because it is more stable than Ropsten. Test networks may suffer denial of service attacks, as the Ether involved does not have any real value and Ropsten is more susceptible to this, because of the consensus algorithm used.Once installed, we can start geth as follows:geth --rinkeby --syncmode fast --rpc --datadir=$HOME/rinkebyThis tells geth to connect to Rinkeby, use the fast synchronisation mode (which speeds up the initial blockchain download by not replaying the entire transaction history), enables the RPC interface (which we need to connect to the node programatically) and to store the blockchain data in a rinkeby sub-directory of our home directory. I have added this last argument for the purpose of this tutorial, to make sure we know where the data will be, as the default location varies between operating systems.The node cannot be used for transactions yet, until your node is fully synced, i.e. once it has imported the blockchain state. This may take a long time (maybe an hour in Rinkeby\u2019s case, longer for the main network)In the meantime we can create an account and get some test Ether. In a different terminal type the following to create an account:geth account new --datadir=\"$HOME/rinkeby/\"After defining a password your keys will be created and added to your key store in the data directory (you should always backup your keys). The account\u2019s address will be displayed.You will need some Rinkeby test Ether credited to your account, in order to send transactions. This can be requested at the Rinkeby faucet. Follow the link and complete the instructions to have some Ether transferred to your account. The balance on your node will not update until your node is in sync, but you can search for your account on https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/.Once we have done all this, we just have to wait for our node to catch up with the blockchain. We can connect to the running geth instance\u2019s interactive console by typing the following in the command line:geth attach ipc:/$HOME/rinkeby/geth.ipcThe geth.ipc file is automatically created for inter process communication. The console is a Javascript console with Web3 injected. We can query the node to see wether it is still syncing by typing:eth.syncingWhilst this returns true the node is still catching up. When syncing is complete true is returned and you should then also be able to see latest block number with:eth.blockNumberBefore we can execute any transaction we need to unlock the account we are using. This can be achieved in the interactive console by typing:personal.unlockAccount(address, \"password\", 300)Substitute address for your account address (in double quotes) and your password for your password. The third arguments indicates the number of seconds the account should remain unlocked.To avoid doing this every time, we can also keep an account unlocked for the whole time a node is running, by adding a command line argument:geth --rinkeby --syncmode fast --rpc --password <(echo password) --unlock 0 --datadir=\"$HOME/rinkeby/\"The above is our start up command, modified to unlock the fist account in the account list (index 0) with the password supplied.Deploying the contractOnce you have some Ether and your node is in sync, we can deploy our notary contract. We will use truffle for this.As in part 1 of this tutorial we need to edit the truffle.js file to add the network details:module.exports = {  networks: {    development: {       host: \"localhost\",       port: 7545,       network_id: \"*\"    },    rinkeby: {       host: \"localhost\",       port: 8545,       network_id: \"4\",       gas: 4000000    }  }};You already know the format of this file, but here we have added network id 4, which is Rinkeby and have also supplied the maximum amount of gas we are happy to spend for contract deployment. The other relevant parameter, the gas price, could also be specified, but we will use the default value.Let\u2019s deploy the contract with:truffle migrate --network rinkebyThis should take longer now, as we are connecting to a real network and executing real transactions. We will receive deploy addresses for both the Migrations and the Notary contracts. Take note of the Notary contract\u2019s address, as we will need this to connect to it.Connecting to the deployed contractIn order to connect our command line tool the contract deployed on Rinkeby, we have to change our initialisation code to point to the contract address on Rinkeby, which we have just received from the deploy operation. In the code below, substitute the address for your own (the actual address is valid, as I have deployed an instance of the contract there).address = \"0xd121f94184Da71908123a1e08F72cAB8573b9363\";Furthermore, instead of connecting to Ganache we now need to connect to our real Ethereum node\u2019s RPC interface. To do so, we need to change the port number of our Web3 provider to whatever our node uses (8545 for geth by default):let provider = new Web3.providers.HttpProvider(\"http://localhost:8545\");web3 = new Web3(provider);Our command line tool now work as previously, but connects to the real blockchain. Transactions now don\u2019t get mined instantly, so you may have to wait a bit before being able to verify a fingerprint, until the file\u2019s fingerprint been sealed in a new block.Next StepsWe now have a working command line interface connecting to our contract deployed on a real blockchain through our own Ethereum node.Now, every transaction executed costs us our own money, so if we were to offer this service to the public (through a web interface for example), we could either charge for our service to cover this cost, or find another way to make sure those wishing to certify documents spend there own Ether.In part 3 of this tutorial, we will look at how to do this by making end-users sign transactions with their own accounts.The source code for this tutorial can be found on GitHub:stbeyer/docCertTutorialdocCertTutorial \u2014 Blockchain based document certification tutorialgithub.com", "responses": 1, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Web3", "Smart Contracts", "Development", "Blockchain"]}, {"title": "Ethereum Development Guide \u2014 Part 3", "post_link": "https://medium.com/cryptronics/ethereum-development-guide-part-3-c5a402bf8815?source=search_post", "author_name": "Stefan Beyer", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@sbeyer_31150", "publish_date": "2018-01-05", "last_modified_date": "2019-02-11", "readtime": "6.73", "claps": 18, "voters": 6, "content": "Ethereum Development Guide \u2014 Part 3Stefan BeyerFollowJan 5, 2018 \u00b7 7 min readDeveloping web interfaces for smart contractsIntroductionIn part 1 and part 2 of this tutorial series we have developed an Ethereum smart contract for document certification and a command-line tool to make use of the service. In this third part of the guide, we will look at how we can make this service publicly available through a web application.Prerequisites and learning outcomesIn order to follow this tutorial, you should have also followed part 1 and part 2, or at least have the source code from these tutorials and understand it:stbeyer/docCertTutorialdocCertTutorial \u2014 Blockchain based document certification tutorialgithub.comAs in the previous tutorial, we will use Javascript and Node.js, so some working knowledge of this is required.After completing this tutorial you will know how to:Use the web3.js library in a web environment to connect to an Ethereum smart contractHow to use MetaMask to allow users to sign for transactions with their own keysBuild a web application that connects to a smart contract, executing transactions and callsDesigning the web interfaceFirst, let us define a web interface which will eventually connect to our contract. As this is not a web design tutorial, we will use some very basic html, although I use the bootstrap framework to make the front-end look acceptable.The following is what we want the application to look like:Let\u2019s create a directory webapp and create a file index.html inside the directory with the following content:As you can see we are importing some bootstrap related stylesheet and javascript files from content delivery networks. This also includes the JQuery library which is used by bootstrap and we will also use to simplify our own Javascript.The other two libraries we need are web3 and jsSHA, which we already know from part 2 of this guide. For jsSHA we just copy the sha256.js file into our webapp directory. You can copy this file from the npm imported modules we used in part 2 or from the libraries git repository.In the case of web3, getting the correct file is slightly more complicated. The required file for the browser version of this library should be in the dist folder of the git repository or npm module. However, at the time of writing, even the 1.0 branch of the web3 git repository does not include the correct 1.0 version of the library in the dist folder. I use version 1.0 in this tutorial, as it makes more sense to learn the updated interface of this new version. The required file can be build from source, but as this may fail because of missing dependencies on some installations, it may be easiest to copy it from my repository.The other two Javascript files are the ones in which we will develop our application code. We will get to these soon, but first of all, make sure you have a local web server installed, to serve our web application (web3 does not work correctly, if served from the file system). If you do not have a local web server application you may use http-server. This can be installed globally with:npm install http-server -gNow we can serve our web application on http://localhost:8080 by executing the following command in our webapp directory:http-server .We can now navigate to the page.Designing the contract connectionIf we connect to our contract through our Ethereum node, as in part 2 of this guide, we hit two problems:The node does not run on the end-users computer, so we would have to make it publicly accessible, which is a security risk.Each time a user uploads a document hash, a transaction fee occurs, which is charged to our account. In order to offer our document certification service publicly, we thus cover the bill for our end-users.We could of course ask our users to run their own Ethereum nodes, but then we would provide a service that is difficult to use. A better solution would be to ask users to pay a fee for submitting a file hash to cover our cost, and hide our node behind a REST API (i.e. requests to the contract are sent form the front-end to our back-end server and passed to the Ethereum node there).There is however a third solution, which is the one we will explore here: We can ask our user to sign transactions with their own keys, without running a full node, and by using a user-friendly light wallet.To this end, we will use the MetaMask browser plugin, which is available for Chrome and Firefox. MetaMask is an Ethereum wallet for the browser. The extension actually injects a web3 provider into the browser, which allows us to connect to the blockchain via a MetaMask provided node. We can use web3 as usual and MetaMask will automatically pop up and ask users to confirm transactions and, importantly, spend their own Ether. In our web application we can tell users to install MetaMask, for example by linking the following image to the MetaMask website:Go ahead and install MetaMask in your browser and create an account. MetaMask will appear in your toolbar displaying an image of a fox. In this tutorial we will use our contract deployed on the Rinkeby test network in part 2 of this guide, so make sure you select Rinkeby as the network to connect to in your MetaMask installation. The network can be selected in a drop down menu at the top of the MetaMask extension\u2019s user interface.As in part 2, we require some Rinkeby test Ether in our account. You can transfer some test Ether you may still have from the previous tutorial to your MetaMask account, or use the Rinkeby Ether faucet again to request additional Ether.Connecting to our contractOnce we have MetaMask set up to the Rinkeby network, with some test Ether in our account, we can write the missing Javascript code to connect our web interface. Fist of all, let\u2019s define a contract wrapper module again, this time in a file called notaryWebApp.js with the following content:As your can see the code is similar to the contract wrapper module we defined for our command line tool in part 2 of this guide. The functions to send a hash value to the contract and to verify a hash value are unchanged, so we will not discuss them again.What has changed however is the initialisation code that created the link to our web3 provider:if (typeof web3 !== 'undefined') {    window.web3 = new Web3(web3.currentProvider);} else {    alert(\"No Ethereum interface injected into browser. Read-only access\");}MetaMask injects a web3 object, which used to be a full version of the library. However, in order to deal with different library versions, only a small subset to get the provider is guaranteed to be supported in the foreseeable future, which is why we have included our own copy of the web3 code in our Javascript imports in the html code. The above code checks if we have an injected web3 objects, i.e. it checks wether MetaMask or a compatible extension is installed (the official Ethereum Mist browser also injects web3). If this is found to be the case, we create a new web3 object with our library pointing to the existing existing provider. If no web3 object is found, we display an alert.The contract address and ABI declarations and the contract object definition are unchanged (Remember to replace the contract address, if you want to use your own instance).We can now create our application code in an app.js file in the webapp directory:We call the contracts wrapper init() function when the document is fully loaded. The two functions send() and find() are executed when the buttons in our html are clicked. As you can see, the hash values are calculated as previously, and we make sure that all HEX strings start with a leading \u201c0x\u201d, so that the contract bindings will translate to the Solidity byte32 data type correctly. We use JQuery to inject html into the web page to show the blockchain response.If we use the upload dialogue and click on the \u201cFingerprint to Blockchain\u201d button, MetaMask we pop up and request transaction confirmation:MetaMask confirmation dialogIf we confirm the transaction, MetaMask sends it via its Ethereum node, signed with the end-users key. We are presented with a result similar to this:We now have to wait for a short time for the transaction to be mined (you can confirm this by searching for the transaction ID on https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/.Once the transaction is mined verifying the file by clicking \u201cFind on Blockchain\u201d returns output similar to the following:ConclusionIn this three part guide we have shown the process of developing an Ethereum smart contract based application, using document certification as a simple but useful example. We have developed and tested the contract locally, before deploying it to a real Ethereum blockchain. We have connected to the contract through our own Ethereum node and through MetaMask. Furthermore, we have used the web3 library to create a command-line interface and a web application.The source code for this tutorial can be found on GitHub:stbeyer/docCertTutorialdocCertTutorial \u2014 Blockchain based document certification tutorialgithub.com", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Metamask", "Web3", "Blockchain", "Development"]}, {"title": "ERC-721 Token", "post_link": "https://medium.com/quiknode/erc-721-token-ea80c7195102?source=search_post", "author_name": "Gaurav Agrawal", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@gaurav.agrawal", "publish_date": "2019-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2019-06-07", "readtime": "7.11", "claps": 29, "voters": 7, "content": "ERC-721 TokenCreate Your Own NFT on Ethereum BlockchainGaurav AgrawalFollowJun 7 \u00b7 8 min readGoal \u2014 We will explore the ERC-721 token standard, non-fungibility, and build a SIMPLE ERC-721 token.What is an ERC 721 Token?The ERC-721 Token standard is the Ethereum token standard which enables Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain. Just like the ERC-20 Token standard helps in creating fungible tokens, the ERC-721 focuses on non-fungible asset design. Do you remember CryptoKitties? That is a non-fungible token (i.e. each Kitty asset is unique).FungibilityBefore understanding non-fungibility, we need to understand what is fungibility. There are two main properties of fungibility:Interchangeability \u2014 You can interchange or replace units of a fungible asset. Your $20 bill and my $20 bill represents the same thing and can be interchanged. Another example that 1kg gold bar is equal to another 1k gold bar. They represent the same value and can be interchanged.Quantity \u2014 You can merge units of a fungible asset to get a higher value in quantity. The example you can add up multiple KGs of grains and now you have the same thing but in a higher quantity.NonfungibilityLet\u2019s understand what is non-fungibility.A non-fungible token represents a unique token which can\u2019t be interchanged with another token.You can\u2019t divide or add up to get a higher quantity because every unit is unique and you cannot replace or interchange it with other assets. For example, two pieces of land. They are both non-fungible regarding their location.Image source- Every Kitty is unique and represents a different token. Aren\u2019t they cute? See the leftmost one, isn\u2019t he shy? \ud83d\ude0bExample of Non-Fungible TokensThere are many Non-Fungible Tokens. Some famous NFTs are CryptoKitties, Etheremons, Crypto Bots, and Blockchain Cuties. You can check a full list of ERC-721 tokens here.The ERC-721 StandardNow\u2019s let deep dive into the ERC-721 standard. The ERC-721 standard defines a set of methods which help in identifying and interacting with a Non-Fungible Token.Events- events which get emitted on Transfer, Approvals.ERC-721 FunctionsbalanceOf \u2014 Will return the balance of an address.ownerOf \u2014 Will return owner address of a token.safeTransferFrom \u2014Transfer token from one address to another with checks performed to make sure the recipient can accept the token, so it doesn\u2019t get burned/lost.transferFrom \u2014 Transfer token from one address to another address (note: the use of this function is discouraged). The Caller of the method is responsible to put the correct recipient address.approve \u2014 Approve any other address to send a transaction from token owner account to any other account.setApprovalForAll \u2014 Allow or disallow an operator (any address, mostly wallets and exchanges) to send all tokens from owner address to any other address.getApproved \u2014 Return an address which is allowed to transfer token for owners. Return 0 if no address is set.isApprovedForAll \u2014 Return true if given operator (any address) is approved by a given owner.pragma solidity ^0.4.20;interface ERC721 /* is ERC165 */ {event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 indexed _tokenId);event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _approved, uint256 indexed _tokenId);event ApprovalForAll(address indexed _owner, address indexed _operator, bool _approved);function balanceOf(address _owner) external view returns (uint256);function ownerOf(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (address);function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId, bytes data) external payable;function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId) external payable;function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId) external payable;function approve(address _approved, uint256 _tokenId) external payable;function setApprovalForAll(address _operator, bool _approved) external;function getApproved(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (address);function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) external view returns (bool);}Building an ERC-721 Token using OpenZeppelin and TruffleNow let\u2019s build an ERC-721 token using the OpenZeppelin library and Truffle.First, let\u2019s setup Truffle:mkdir simpletruffle initnpm install openzeppelin-solidityLet\u2019s create a new Contract for our SIMPLE Token:pragma solidity ^0.4.24;import \"/openzeppelin-solidity/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721Full.sol\";import \"/openzeppelin-solidity/contracts/ownership/Ownable.sol\";contract SIMPLEToken is ERC721Full, Ownable{    constructor()   ERC721Full(\"SIMPLE\", \"SMPL\")  public {}function mint(address to, uint256 tokenId) public onlyOwner {   _mint(to, tokenId);  }function _mint(address to) public onlyOwner{   mint(to, totalSupply().add(1));  }}Let\u2019s see what we are doing here. We are inheriting two contracts; ERC721FULL and Ownable.Ownable \u2014 Using this contract, we can manage ownership of our contract and are able to mint tokens from the contract owner\u2019s account only.ERC721FULL \u2014 This is a standard implementation of ERC-721 interface we have mentioned above. Let\u2019s see what happens inside this contract:pragma solidity ^0.4.24;import \"./ERC721.sol\";import \"./ERC721Enumerable.sol\";import \"./ERC721Metadata.sol\";contract ERC721Full is ERC721, ERC721Enumerable, ERC721Metadata {  constructor(string name, string symbol) ERC721Metadata(name, symbol)    public  {  }}ERC721FULL internally inherits 3 contracts. We will look mainly into ERC721 to understand the implementation.Let\u2019s go through the main function one by one. Before that, we will understand, how tokens are getting stored:// Mapping from token ID to owner  mapping (uint256 => address) private _tokenOwner;// Mapping from token ID to approved address  mapping (uint256 => address) private _tokenApprovals;// Mapping from owner to number of owned token  mapping (address => uint256) private _ownedTokensCount;// Mapping from owner to operator approvals  mapping (address => mapping (address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;_tokenOwner \u2014 This mapping is needed to store a token against its owner. By using this we can know who is the owner for given tokenId._tokenApprovals \u2014 This mapping is needed to store tokenId, against an address which is approved by the token owner, to transfer a token on behalf of the owner._ownedTokenCount \u2014 This mapping is needed to know how many tokens an address owns. If we don\u2019t create this mapping, we have to loop to get this information and looping takes lots of gas on EVM._operatorApprovals \u2014 Mapping of an owner and an operator (any address, mostly wallets, and exchanges) to check if the owner had given approval or not.Now let\u2019s see functions in this standard:balanceOf \u2014 This will return the balance of an address. First, it checks for a valid address and then using _ownedTokensCount returns the count of the token.function balanceOf(address owner) public view returns (uint256) {    require(owner != address(0));    return _ownedTokensCount[owner];  }OwnerOf \u2014 This will return the owner address for a given token using _tokenOwner mapping.function ownerOf(uint256 tokenId) public view returns (address) {    address owner = _tokenOwner[tokenId];    require(owner != address(0));    return owner;  }approve \u2014 This will approve an address to transfer a token on behalf of the owner. The function first checks if the owner called the function or if the call is approved by the owner to send all tokens. Then it updates the _tokenApprovals mapping if everything is correct.function approve(address to, uint256 tokenId) public {    address owner = ownerOf(tokenId);    require(to != owner);    require(msg.sender == owner || isApprovedForAll(owner, msg.sender));_tokenApprovals[tokenId] = to;    emit Approval(owner, to, tokenId);  }safeTransferFrom \u2014 There are two functions with similar names, but with different arguments. These functions internally call transferFrom function. Though they also perform one more important duty. They check if the recipient address is valid for receiving the token or not. This helps in the security of the token.function safeTransferFrom(    address from,    address to,    uint256 tokenId,    bytes _data  )    public  {    transferFrom(from, to, tokenId);    require(_checkOnERC721Received(from, to, tokenId, _data));  }transferFrom \u2014 This is the main function to transfer a token from one address to another address. Let\u2019s see what is it doing:1- Check if the token is either owned by called or approved to the caller. Also, checks of a valid address.2- Clear approval, remove current ownership and reduce the token count of the current owner.3- Add token to recipient account and increase the token count for the recipient.function transferFrom(    address from,    address to,    uint256 tokenId  )    public  {    require(_isApprovedOrOwner(msg.sender, tokenId));    require(to != address(0));_clearApproval(from, tokenId);    _removeTokenFrom(from, tokenId);    _addTokenTo(to, tokenId);emit Transfer(from, to, tokenId);  }setApprovalForAll \u2014 This function approves the address to transfer all tokens on behalf of the owner. It first checks if the called and to address are not the same, and then updates the _operatorApprovals mapping.function setApprovalForAll(address to, bool approved) public {    require(to != msg.sender);    _operatorApprovals[msg.sender][to] = approved;    emit ApprovalForAll(msg.sender, to, approved);  }isApprovedForAll \u2014 This function checks if the owner approved the operator to transfer tokens or not.function isApprovedForAll(    address owner,    address operator  )    public    view    returns (bool)  {    return _operatorApprovals[owner][operator];  }getApproved \u2014 Returns the approved address for given tokenId.function getApproved(uint256 tokenId) public view returns (address) {    require(_exists(tokenId));    return _tokenApprovals[tokenId];  }You can check the other helper functions and inherited contracts.If you don\u2019t understand something, please ask in comments! We\u2019re here to help!Testing ERC-721 TokenNow we will test our SIMPLE token and play around it. We will use a local built-in blockchain to deploy and test the contract.truffle developThis will give us the Truffle console.Now let\u2019s deploy our contract. Remember! You need to add a migration file. You can check the attached GitHub repo at the end of the article.truffle compilemigrate --resetSIMPLEToken.deployed().then((simple) => {token = simple;})Now, let\u2019s mint some tokens, and perform a test transfer & approval.token._mint(web3.eth.accounts[0]) // will mint a new tokentoken.totalSupply() // check token's total supplytoken.safeTransferFrom(web3.eth.accounts[0] , web3.eth.accounts[1], 1) // transfer token (token id 1) from 0'th account to 1st accounttoken.ownerOf(1) // check owner of token id 1token._mint(web3.eth.accounts[0]) // will mint another tokentoken.approve(web3.eth.accounts[3] , 2) // approve token id 2 to  account[3]token.safeTransferFrom(web3.eth.accounts[0] , web3.eth.accounts[1], 2 , {from:web3.eth.accounts[3]})   // Note that we are adding {from:web3.eth.accounts[3]}, this mean that we are invoking this function using account[3]You can go ahead and test all methods (OpenZeppelin is a well-tested library so you don\u2019t need to worry about the functionality provided by the library). You should instead be focusing on testing any functionality added by you \ud83d\ude0eConclusionToday we have created a Non-Fungible Token using Solidity on Ethereum. NFT tokens are mostly used as collectibles and have a variety of other use-cases, such as representing real-estate, artwork, certificates, loans, etc\u2026 There is a big use-case in gaming where one can use NFTs to represent items and collectibles across games and platforms.

If you take a look at our official product timeline @ ProductPlan, here are the main new things to look out for from April:The TokenCard alphaKYC\u2019ing our first usersTokenCard EUR cardsSmart Contract auditsThe TokenCard AlphaWe launched the TokenCard Alpha last month (!), allowing our community \u2014 for the first time \u2014 to download the TokenCard app and order their card. The response has been amazing, with our community requesting invites in the hundreds, testing the app and sharing their thoughts and feedback along the way. \ud83d\udc49 Want to join in? Sign up at tokencard.io/alpha. \ud83d\udc48As a direct result of the feedback and insight we\u2019ve seen from our Community, we\u2019ve made a lot of positive changes and fixes: tweaking the sign-up flow, making amendments to topping up your card, improving the app\u2019s design, plus a number of bug fixes to make a life on Ethereum that bit more magical.We\u2019ve also seen a lot of requests from our Community asking for some insight into how many people we\u2019ve invited, how many contracts have been deployed, and more. Here are some headline stats for the TokenCard alpha so far:\ud83d\udcb3 500+ invites sent out so far;\ud83d\udcb3 200+ Contract Wallets deployed (view them live on Etherscan);\ud83d\udcb3 Users registering interest from 29 countries!And we\u2019re not done there. We\u2019ll be working to get more Etherians involved in the TokenCard alpha, as well as making it smoother for the people we\u2019ve invited to install, deploy their Contract Wallet, and order their card. It\u2019s going to get even more exciting.KYC\u2019ing our first usersA core element of the TokenCard order process is KYC, or \u2018Know Your Customer\u2019 \u2014 not only does it comprise a big part of our regulatory commitments, but it also allows us to confirm that you\u2019re really you, and that you are ordering a TokenCard.As part of this, the Engineering team have been putting in changes to make the TokenCard app slicker and more accessible; tweaking how we handle addresses, and improving our integration with our various KYC providers.The Product team have also been taking extra care this month to QA our KYC processors and providers, and \u2014 along with the Compliance \u2014 team they have been manually reviewing all applications to make sure we\u2019re picking up on the right things. Our longer-term roadmap is to automate this once we\u2019ve really put the process through its paces.TokenCard EUR cardsICYMI from our Newsletter, the Product and Engineering team also released a huge update for our friends on the Continent: support for Euro (\u20ac) as a base currency for your TokenCard! This means that users are now able to pick their preferred currency of EUR (\u20ac) or GBP (\u00a3) during the card order process.Wondering what this means for you? EUR TokenCard users won\u2019t encounter fees on domestic POS purchases when spending within the Eurozone. In a nutshell: 1 card, 19 countries, 0 (POS) fees.Smart Contract auditsAs our readers and community are aware, investing the time up-front into ensuring our Smart Contract code is not only fit for function, but also watertight, is a major priority. Last month we began an audit process on the entirety of the Smart Contract code, including the code that splits the load into the Community Contribution\u2019s 1% and to our \u201cCryptoFloat\u201d. The output of the audit by the Trail of Bits found no high or critical bugs, which is fantastic news, and the team are working on making the little changes suggested by Trail of Bits \u2014 more news on this soon.The Engineering team are really happy with the findings from the audit. The next step is for us to put the entire repository online, alongside the outputs of the other audits. We\u2019ll update this blog with links, as well as pushing to our wider community, once that\u2019s done.Being transparent with our community is something we\u2019re super committed to, and this runs from the Marketing efforts you see, to what we\u2019re building at a technical level.Until next time, happy testing.\u2014 Team TokenCard", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Web3", "Product", "Fintech", "Cryptocurrency"]}, {"title": "Ethereum Ecosystem Statistics", "post_link": "https://medium.com/quiknode/ethereum-ecosystem-statistics-7fb5999a45c9?source=search_post", "author_name": "Gaurav Agrawal", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@gaurav.agrawal", "publish_date": "2019-07-01", "last_modified_date": "2019-07-01", "readtime": "5.29", "claps": 22, "voters": 7, "content": "Ethereum Ecosystem StatisticsWhat happened in 2018/2019 & where we are going!Gaurav AgrawalFollowJul 1 \u00b7 6 min readToday, we will look into Ethereum statistics and see what happened in 2018\u20132019; what worked, what didn\u2019t, and what\u2019s coming next \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf16\ud83d\ude4ctl;drLess ICO buzz \ud83d\udcc4High Smart Contract creation, usage, and growing developer adoption \ud83d\udcddERC20 still dominates as a token standard \u2699More DApps, but w/ limited user adoption (yet!) \ud83d\udee0#DeFi is on the move \ud83d\udcc8As Bitcoin\u2019s price rose in 2017, everyone wanted a coin and Ethereum was ideally placed for this situation. Anyone could build a token on the Ethereum blockchain in less than an hour, and opportunists did exactly that \u2014 shouting for the tokenization of everything from the top of the Eiffel Tower (many without a legitimate use-case, real understanding of blockchain technology, token economics, incentivization, or decentralization\u2026 [yes, I am cynical about ICOs now and I dislike them, #opinion]).There were all sorts of useless coins and Ethereum became a token-making machine. In this crazy town however, a few projects started which weren\u2019t focused on tokens, but rather using Ethereum\u2019s Smart Contract technology and building real, decentralized applications (dApps).As the bear market of 2018 crushed the crowd sale trend and tested the strength & durability of many blockchain projects, it\u2019s refreshing to say that developers are now building some awesome, usable dApps \ud83d\ude03!No More ICO BuzzThe first half of the 2018 saw a massive boom in crowd sales. Thousands of ICO\u2019s raised Billions of dollars. There were a lot of scams too, but bear market killed \u201ceasy money\u201d and ICOs are not able to attract investors so quickly anymore. Only 189K Ethers were invested in different crowd sales last month, compared to 1.92M Ethers invested in June 2017. (ETH price in June 2017 ~$350 and in May 2019 ~$250).Eth spent in Crowdsale by months. as you can see since the last may crowd sale market is on the downtrend but as you can see from may 209, there is an uprising againLet\u2019s see what happens in June 2019 >>Average Ether collected per token sale \u2014 207 ETHAverage transaction per token sale \u2014 116Average Ether per transaction \u2014 1.99 ETHAverage amount of Ether participation token in a token sale \u2014 6.05 ETH81 crowd sales out of 589 collected more than 100 ETH in June 2019.22.5k buyers participated in different token sales in June 2019.Good projects will always manage to raise funds, but now ICOs receive more scrutiny from investors and regulators, so it\u2019s a much more difficult process. A bull market can certainly change the dynamics of this \u2014 so we\u2019ll have to see.Left \u2014 Average ETH collected by a token Crowdsale // Right \u2014 Number of transfers per token sale on average (you can clearly see the downtrend)Unique participants for overall token sale per month (you can see as the bull market is coming..ICOs are getting more participants)Tokens which collected more than 100 ETH lifetime\u2026 This chart shows that good ICOs are still able to raise funds, though we need to understand that the price of ETH really matters here: when Ether was 500 USD, 100 ETH was worth 50K USD; at the time of writing this article, 100 ETH is worth ~330K USDDifferent ERC Standards in UseThe ERC20 token standard is widely accepted. There are over 45,000 tokens on Ethereum and the majority of them are ERC20. Active token counts are increasing and we currently have 2700 unique tokens with an average of 330,000 daily transactions \u2014 which are equal to ETH\u2019s daily average transactions.Despite that ERC233 and ERC827 are considered \u201cbetter token standards for ERC20 replacement\u201d, they haven\u2019t gotten significant traction, having only a small fraction of total actively used currencies.More than 4,000 tokens having an active daily transaction.CryptoKitties received around 67.5k ETH and around 1.48 Million transactions until now.statistics by various token types (only those in active use)Daily Unique tokens in operationSmart Contract CreationEthereum is a Smart Contract platform and the growing number of Smart Contracts per month shows developer adoption. In May 2019 alone, more than 500,000 Smart Contracts were created and 99% of them are the generic type. Token sale contracts are in the second position, but they are nominal in terms of generic contracts.Being a tech platform, developer adoption is one of the most important metrics for Ethereum. More developers = more ideas and innovations. This will be the key to Smart Contracts\u2019 use and widespread adoption.Daily created Smart ContractsDifferent usage of Smart Contracts monthly basis. This is a very important index which shows that Etherum is truly a Smart Contract platform, and most of these contracts are generic types (i.e. not ICOs).Smart Contract UsageSmart Contract usage is steady and declined only slight from the last year. However, Smart Contract call data now shows that contracts are being used more. In my view, Smart Contract usage is the only metric we should focus on.Smart Contract Usage# of Smart Contract CallsHow are dApps Doing?On the dApp adoption side, things somehow didn\u2019t change much since last year. Currently, there are around 27K users/day for all the dApps built on Ethereum. That said, Ether volume on dApps is growing and is now around 22.98k ETH per month.Most of the ETH volume is on Exchanges (trading tokens), DeFi (decentralized finance \u2014 lending, borrowing, etc\u2026), and Games/Gambling. When we talk about the number of daily users, the Gaming category is on top.Storage is one more interesting category which is getting the attraction recently.DAU (daily active users) for all the dApps built on EthereumDaily ETH Volume of all dAppsdApps\u2019 Daily users by categories (you can see that Games are on top)#DeFi is on the MoveDecentralized Finance is growing exponentially and we will dig into DeFi stats in the next article, so make sure you will subscribe for our newsletter below!ConclusionOne can see from the evidence \u261d\ufe0f that there is growth in dApp market, but we will need more breakthroughs for adoption (i.e. mobile device adoption will be the key for #Web3 technology going mainstream).Ethereum is an important decentralized platform, and while ICOs are interesting vessels for fundraising, they are not the future \u2014 dApps are.Intermingled dApps will create scalable web services, which will yield better UX, hence lead to mainstream adoption. Projects focused on building this infrastructure will see great success in the future.I believe we are at the dawn of the decentralized Web, a web where privacy, censorship-resistance, and self-sovereignty will be built-in. I hope we will continue on this path. As we saw the rise of different technologies and how they affect human life, decentralization will be the most important technology which will fundamentally change human behavior for collectively sharing and exchanging information on the Internet.We needed a truly global economy and decentralized tech is the pathway. Users will have the utmost freedom and participation cost will be reduced to just having an internet connection.About QuikNodeQuikNode is building infrastructure to support the future of Web3.

For example, if you have token \u2018X\u2019, then you can use this token on its \u2018X\u2019 platform. This limits the token\u2019s usage! The Kyber network solves this by creating a token reserve so you can swap tokens in real-time. So now if a website accepts DAI for payments, but you have only OMG, you can pay with OMG, which will get swapped in real-time to DAI.The Kyber Protocol brings token inventories and prices on-chain, hence allowing developers to directly embed value exchanges into their smart-contracts without any technical or security overhead.This allows for:Instant confirmationOperation certainty (there is no transactional risk, settlement uncertainty or counterparty risk)Global and diverse pool of different tokensSwap Tokens using Kyber NetworkWe will go through the Kyber network workshop demo and swap tokens using Kyber network smart-contracts.Set up:Install NodeJsInstall Ganache-Clisudo npm install -g ganache-cliInstall Trufflesudo npm install -g truffle@latestClone Repository:git clone https://github.com/KyberNetwork/workshop.gitRepository OverviewLet\u2019s see what we\u2019ve got in the repository:config \u2014 Configs used by Kyber contracts for \u201cmigrations\u201d.

For that we need to run the migration:truffle migrate --network developmentThis will take some time\u2026We are using a predefined mnemonic, so you will get the same addresses defined below:Running Truffle example:Let's run an example from truffle directory.truffle exec examples/truffle/getExpectedRate.jsThis will give us the exchange rates but with different configured tokens.Running Web3 example:Let\u2019s get the exchange rate again \u2014 but this time, we will use NodeJs.cd examples/web3node getExpectedRate.jsUsing solidity contract for swapping token:Now let\u2019s swap tokens by interacting with Kyber network contracts.We will swap KNC (Kyber Network Token) with OMG (OmiseGO Token).Remember, you can do the same with using Web3 and Truffle examples, but running the test with Truffle console is a lot easier and interactive. So let\u2019s get truffle console:truffle consoleOur user address is 0x47a793D7D0AA5727095c3Fe132a6c1A46804c8D2 \u2014 this we will use again, so let\u2019s assign it to a variable:let userWallet = '0x47a793D7D0AA5727095c3Fe132a6c1A46804c8D2'We have a Trade.sol in our Solidity folder, which we help us in swapping the token. You can check out the code for the contract: examples > solidity > Trade.sol.Now, we need to get an instance for that Contract:let tradeInstance = await Trade.at(Trade.address)Next, as we are going to swap KNC with OMG, let's get the Instance for both contracts. You can find these token contract undercontracts \u2192 mockTokens . These are mock ERC20 tokens. In production, you will need actual contract address for these tokens on ETH MainNet.let kncInstance = await KyberNetworkCrystal.at(KyberNetworkCrystal.address)let omgInstance = await OmiseGo.at(OmiseGo.address)Now, let\u2019s get our balance for each token:let kycBalance1 = (await kncInstance.balanceOf(userWallet)).toString()let omgBalance1 = (await omgInstance.balanceOf(userWallet)).toString()You can check these balance by running:kycBalance1omgBalance1Now, we need to give Trade contract approval to withdraw tokens from our contract:await kncInstance.approve(tradeInstance.address , web3.utils.toWei('100000'), {from : userWallet})We can now swap tokens! Let\u2019s look at the Trade.sol method, which we will use to swap the tokens:function execSwap( ERC20 srcToken, uint srcQty, ERC20 destToken, address destAddress, uint maxDestAmount)Here,srcToken \u2014 source token contract addresssrcQty \u2014 amount of source tokensdestToken \u2014 destination token contract addressdestAddress \u2014 address to send swapped tokens tomaxDestAmount \u2014 address to send swapped tokens toSo let\u2019s call the method accordingly:tradeInstance.execSwap(kncInstance.address, web3.utils.toWei(\"100\") , omgInstance.address,userWallet, web3.utils.toWei(\"1000000\"), {from: userWallet})If you have followed the tutorial \u2018till now, you have successfully swapped two tokens using Kyber Network protocol!Let\u2019s verify our token balance again:let kycBalance2 = (await kncInstance.balanceOf(userWallet)).toString()let omgBalance2 = (await omgInstance.balanceOf(userWallet)).toString()kycBalance2omgBalance2You will see the change in balance.

Ostensibly it was in reaction to the fact that Twitter keeps arbitrarily banning some of the most valued members of the Ethereum community such as Evan Van Ness, Jarrad Hope, and Liam Horne. However, it was equally an experiment to see what a week without Twitter would feel like. I was craving some time off, and a short, meaningful boycott felt like just the right catalyst.A tiny bit of background information: inspired by Jaron Lanier, I\u2019ve been working on eliminating centralized, Web2 social media from my life for some time. I stopped using Instagram over a year ago, and haven\u2019t missed it. I finally deleted my LinkedIn account a few days ago \u2014 good riddance, since 99% of what I received there was spam and anyone who really needs to reach me will find me another way. I haven\u2019t posted on Facebook in years; deleting it entirely has been a goal for a while and I am nearly there.Twitter, however, is another story. Like an addict who gives up drinking and gambling but decides to keep smoking so he has one last vice he can throw overboard, cutting off all other social media only increased the importance of Twitter in my life. I noticed that I was spending more and more time on it, along with a few more troubling signs of addiction: using it in bed and postponing sleep to catch up, scrolling way, way back so that I wouldn\u2019t miss a single notification, paying attention to my follower count, and getting upset when someone blocked me.When you find yourself relying overmuch on something unhealthy, the best thing to do is to go cold turkey for some time and see how you feel.And the result?Would it surprise you if I told you I didn\u2019t miss Twitter that much?I didn\u2019t. Somehow pre-committing not to use it freed me from a great deal of cognitive burden. The only time I found myself missing Twitter was during the in-between moments \u2014 on the bus, waiting in line \u2014 when I couldn\u2019t do something more productive. In those moments, I found more meaningful uses of time, from catching up on articles I\u2019d saved, to podcasts, and forums like Fellowship of Ethereum Magicians and Etherean.org.Here are some of the more surprising takeaways:The first thing I noticed upon reopening Twitter was that, even in spite of Twitter\u2019s algorithms and heavy curation of the people I follow, easily 99% of what I see on Twitter is meaningless garbage. Whether it\u2019s worth sifting through the garbage for the 1% of gems is debatable, given that\u2026I found that the most critical information reached me via other channels, such as Evan\u2019s fantastic Week in Ethereum or certain Telegram groups. I feel more and more like a big ingredient in success in the modern digital economy is an effective information diet, and letting others do the curation for you, where possible, can be a big part of that.On top of that, even if you believe there\u2019s value in what you see on Twitter \u2014 and there is of course some value in being exposed to ideas of and dialogue among people you respect \u2014 there\u2019s little to no time sensitivity in the vast majority of that content. For the same reason, reading a book is nearly always better than reading a news digest, such as a podcast or The Economist, which in turn is nearly always better than getting the news in real time (another enormous waste of time). Again, let time and other people curate what matters for you. You will not miss the most important topics or articles, which will pop up again and again.It was genuinely hard to do research without at least reading content on Twitter. Even for deeply technical topics such as this article which I wrote during my week off, I found myself landing on Twitter again and again as a primary source, or to verify something. I had to amend the rules of my boycott (view Twitter content while logged out) so that I could get work done. It\u2019s genuinely a bit frightening to think about what percentage of institutional knowledge in our, or any, community lives exclusively on Twitter in a format that is not meaningfully indexed or searchable, not to mention owned and managed by an unaccountable third party with the right to censor arbitrarily (as evidenced by the senseless banhammer).Speaking of censorship, without the \u201cTweet\u201d button as an outlet, I found myself self-censoring what I wanted to say \u2014 in the sense that I ended up dropping the less important things (since sharing them was such a hassle), and expanding the more important ideas in long form or in dialogue with friends. I also found myself thinking through these ideas, and developing them more, before sharing them.I thought I had outsmarted Twitter\u2019s dopamine hook by turning off all notifications (as I do for nearly all apps). I was wrong. I didn\u2019t fully appreciate how hooked I was on seeing retweets, mentions, and followers until I went cold turkey for a week. With the dopamine hook rendered useless I felt much more peaceful and felt more cognitive space open up in my day.I took advantage of the time off Twitter to try a Web3 app that I had been meaning to try for ages, a Twitter alternative called Peepeth. It uses Metamask to sign data and IPFS to store it in a fully decentralized, self-sovereign fashion, and it\u2019s one of the few examples today of a functional, end-to-end decentralized app (\u201cdapp\u201d). While it\u2019s a little rough around the edges \u2014 there is still no native mobile app, so you have to run it inside an Ethereum wallet app \u2014 by far the biggest obstacle to engaging more meaningfully is the lack of other users. This drove home the power of network effects and the lunacy of the naive idea, so common in Web3, that, \u201cif we build a better app, the users will follow.\u201d This is especially true of social media. The only chance we have of competing is by (1) exploiting asymmetries to deliver experiences that centralized platforms cannot provide (such as better governance, forks, data interoperability, and allowing multiple, customizable frontends on the same protocol), and (2) building bridges (ideally bidirectional ones) between our decentralized apps and the incumbents. Even then, we should not attempt to go head-to-head with Facebook or Twitter.In summary, going forward, I expect to spend a lot less time on Twitter specifically and Web2 social media in general, and when I do, I expect that time to be much more focused and mindful.If you haven\u2019t already, I highly recommend putting in place good digital hygiene, starting with regular time off social media. Jaron urges you to delete social media entirely, or to take six months off. I challenge you to start with a week.

Cloud computing has emerged as a highly efficient and profitable enterprise where the largest companies on the planet are investing billions of dollars and Moore\u2019s Law continues to hold.In such an environment, wouldn\u2019t you expect cloud storage prices to drop?Unfortunately, the answer is no.There are only three major cloud storage providers in the world outside of China: Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. While cloud storage prices initially dropped when Google entered the market, prices have essentially stagnated for the past five years, although the cost of hard drives have decreased by about 50 percent over that same timeframe (dollar-per-gigabyte) [source].Cisco estimates that by 2021, there will be four internet-connected devices for every person in the world. That\u2019s a lot of data, and it\u2019s not even counting technology that isn\u2019t connected to the internet like 4k cameras and other devices that create some of our biggest datasets. In spite of this proliferation of data, the cost to store data is remaining flat. That means those who are responsible for storing data (and paying to have it stored) are seeing their costs rise at the same rate as we create data. So if your storage bill is roughly 10% of your total costs, in 12\u201318 months, it will be closer to 18%, assuming all other numbers remain the same. This ratio can quickly become burdensome to small, open source projects or free services that we all use on a daily basis.Cost of InnovationOne such case is transfer.sh, a command line file transfer tool created by Remco Verhoef. In an average month, transfer.sh is used more than 1,000,000 times to easily transfer files worldwide. The project started out as all projects do \u2014 Remco wanted to simplify his own life by making it easier to send file transfers from one place to another. His open source project quickly generated interest and users quickly grew. The service was free, but that meant that Remco was the one footing the storage bill. A few months ago, transfer.sh announced it could no longer afford its Amazon S3 bill and would shut down at the end of November.I\u2019d never heard about transfer.sh at the time, but when it was announced the service would shut down for financial reasons, its passionate community quickly rallied to find a solution. I did some research and knew that Storj could help transfer.sh stay alive! I recently contacted Mr. Verhoef to discuss my findings, and we\u2019ve been working with the transfer.sh team to store their data on our internal infrastructure while we fine tune our new network for production launch.\u201cWhen I mentioned my plans to shut down transfer.sh, there where many people trying to help out, asking if I couldn\u2019t transfer the domain to them, etc. But when I started transfer.sh, I didn\u2019t want to create a site bloated with advertisements and timers all over. I just wanted to build something quick and cool to just fulfill one need, transfer files. For over 4 years, I paid about $150k to $200k in total, just to keep a free service, which I believed in, running. Now, with having Storj as a partner, we don\u2019t have to put ads on the platform and can continue transfer.sh under my original vision. It also opens up new opportunities, like continued development, adding Storj as an extra storage layer into the open source transfer.sh codebase,\u201d Remco says.Once our new decentralized cloud storage platform launches in production, we will work with transfer.sh to migrate all its data from our servers to the Storj network. We are excited to be working with such an awesome tool and are happy we could help save it in time.Flighting Big CloudTransfer.sh\u2019s challenge highlights a larger problem many companies are facing. Use of data is growing at an exponential rate, hard drive prices are decreasing, but centralized cloud storage providers are not reducing their prices to match. What can be done?We think that one clear answer lies in the fact that the vast majority of disk drives in the world are severely underutilized.Decentralized storage has the ability to empower the technology community in new ways. By creating a more affordable storage platform for companies, developers and individual users, we expect we will see many use-cases that were once deemed too expensive become a reality. Unlike centralized cloud storage providers, decentralized storage platforms don\u2019t have to invest $600M in a new data center, pay for expensive fire suppression systems, or repave the data center parking lot. Those cost savings are passed along directly to users.And even with decentralized cloud storage being in the early days of its innovation cycle, it is still drastically more affordable than centralized solutions. As it continues to evolve, it is likely to drop in price, just like centralized cloud storage did in its early days. This will be hugely impactful for consumers and developers. If it were not for this new economic model made possible through decentralized storage, we might never see another massive drop in cloud storage costs. As our technological capabilities evolve, a paradigm shift is often necessary for the next wave of innovation to reach the shore. Our team at Storj is excited to see what cool use-cases the decentralization tide washes in.By Shawn Wilkinson, Cofounder and Chief Strategy Officer at Storj LabsOriginally published at storj.io on November 26, 2018.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Cloud Computing", "Decentralization", "Web3", "Cloud Storage", "AWS"]}, {"title": "Robert Habermeier: Implications of Interoperability", "post_link": "https://medium.com/tokyo-fintech/robert-habermeier-implications-of-interoperability-9b698d91ac81?source=search_post", "author_name": "Norbert Gehrke", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@norbert.gehrke", "publish_date": "2018-10-26", "last_modified_date": "2018-10-26", "readtime": "7.84", "claps": 86, "voters": 6, "content": "Robert Habermeier: Implications of InteroperabilityNorbert GehrkeFollowOct 26, 2018 \u00b7 8 min readRobert Habermeier, Co-Founder of Polkadot and Thiel FellowRobert Habermeier, Core Developer at Parity Technologies, Co-Founder of Polkadot, and a 2018 Thiel Fellow, talked about \u201cImplications of Interoperability\u201d at the Web3 Summit in Berlin on Tuesday, October 23.What does it actually mean to have an interoperable network of chains? You have all these different chains that do specific things, what does that actually mean to you as a developer, as a builder, as someone who wants to put things together, at the chain level, or maybe at the application level?First of all, I would like to start with a guiding principle that has been the driving force in the work that we have done in the last couple of years. That is the idea that specialization breeds optimization. If you give developers more flexibility, if you do not lock people into specific frameworks, they have a lot more freedom. That does not only apply at the stage of building things, but also at the stage of computation \u2014 we want to unlock as much algorithmic potential as possible, so that you can really get the best theoretical performance.What we have seen so far is that one size does not fit all. If you try to build any type of application on the blockchain right now, you are going to run into huge scaling issues, you are going to run into issues with storing your data exactly right. The ways that blockchains give you to construct your applications are not sufficient. If you try to build something like a prediction market system, you are going to want to store order books, etc. on chain in ways that current smart contract platforms simply do not give you the flexibility to do. So we need away that allows you to specialize.The current blockchain system is a bit like a group of bubbles floating around in the air. They do not interact, and if they bump into each other, they pop. They try to do everything, and be everything to every application. That does not really make much sense. If instead you created a network where the bubbles were heterogenous, and they did specific things very well, and could interoperate, they could just pass messages, relay the information that work should be done on one chain, then that would a much more powerful paradigm. So we are facing this very fragmented landscape where every blockchain is trying to be a smart contract platform, and a currency, and a scalability solution, and have a new consensus algorithm, etc. However, these different chains cannot even talk to each other, they have to go through centralized services, which defeats the purpose of blockchains in the first place. We want to be able to decentralize, we want to be able to have provable security under specific network assumptions. We do not want people to be locked into a specific platform.Let\u2019s talk for a moment about what a blockchain is actually composed of. There are two key parts. The first part is one that gets talked about a lot, but actually does not have that much significance, both from a builder and a user perspective. That is the consensus algorithm. Consensus is just a way to agree upon what changes have been made, and in which order. The issue with consensus is not to agree that some payments have been made, it is to agree that they have been made in a specific order. And we can use something like Proof-of-Work (PoW) or Proof-of-Stake (PoS) to provide economic incentives for that.But it is the state machine that you usually care about when building a blockchain, so these are the changes that the consensus mechanism actually agrees upon. Whether it is a smart contract platform, or a currency, or it negotiates file storage, or it provides oracles, this is the unique idea that you as a builder have, and are trying to put together. You do not typically think about how you secure it, because the important implications come after security. So if we were to talk about de-duplicating labor, a good start would be to make it so that not everybody building a blockchain is building their own consensus algorithm. Whether or not they invent it from scratch, they still have to put in the work to write something. Until Substrate came, there was not really a convenient way to take some consensus algorithm that somebody else had written and then throw the meat of a blockchain onto it, i.e. the specific thing that you are trying to do. So one big aspect of our goal is to reduce friction for builders \u2014 they can just take this bundle of libraries, like Substrate, and get out of it consensus, get out of it networking, get out of it synchronization, etc. and come away with, more or less, a complete blockchain. The only thing that they would be writing would be that state machine.If we are talking about guiding design principles of an interoperability framework, we would want firstly hierarchality, i.e the idea that you can have chains nested within chains, and messages can be passed all the way up, and all the way down. That is something that grow infinitely, that can be extensible with any new protocol or algorithm that has been conceived. We do this through the use of Turing complete computation. If you have a system that is extensible, you do not have to worry about the technologies you are using right now, you can support the past, the present, and the future.Developability is a significant principle, the idea that developers can actually build something rather than having to spend month and month duplicating the efforts that others have already done.An interoperability framework also needs to be scalable. Right now, at the root level, you would run into quadratic scaling issues, simply because if you had a set of chains, and you had a message queue from every chain to every other chain, then that would be a quadratic amount. The hierarchicality of chains limits that, as you can localize chains close to each other for those that need to communicate the most. This reduces the scaling barrier, you can compress many chains communicating into what seems like only one chain communicating with others. That notion of locality is not only useful at the chain level, but also at the application level.The last principle is generalization. We do not want to lock users into any specific constraints about exactly how their data is stored, exactly how you meter for computation \u2014 the coarser the grains of computation that you meter for with fees, the more work you can basically do. If you have to stop every single instruction to charge a fee, you end up doing half as much work as you would if you had much coarser operations.So what blockchain interoperability is in a nutshell is that chains are initially isolated and serve a distinct purpose. They are basically useless on their own, they might not even have a backing currency or something that properly provides incentives. But then you connect them with this messaging framework, the idea that blockchain can then issue some kind of event that leads to a new transaction applied on another chain. And this is done in a predictable way, the messages that are passed have a predictable set of rules, e.g. ordering and guaranteed delivery.If we were to think about a very simple way to do this, we would have every chain come up with some kind of bridge, and connect each chain with every other chain through such a bridge. But the challenge that this system runs into in the attack of weak chains. The truth is that everything has a price. We will talk about absolute finality in consensus algorithms, but it is not really absolute finality, e.g. there is some sort of state that has been put into the system in case of mining that does not have absolute finality, there is some amount of dollar cost that is being thrown at that chain. So finality can always be reverted for a price. Absolute finality just means \u201cwe have reached the price threshold\u201d. So what blockchains are trying to do is to bring up that price threshold to the maximum possible.Let us look at that same approach with bridges. You have one chain that is relatively weak in security, and one chain that is relatively strong in security. That green block above was finalized on the weaker chain, and sends a message to a block on the second chain,Now, if that first chain is attacked, and that green block no longer exists in that finalized chain, then you might have a message outcome existing on the second chain where the corresponding cause does not exist on the first chain anymore. So that is basically a double spent.One major goal of an interoperability framework is to protect against this attack. You want attacking one chain to be as expensive as attacking all the chains, i.e. you want to unite them under one single source of security. That is what Polkadot does. In Polkadot, you have a relay chain which negotiates the passing of messages between many other chains, and it unites them all under a single consensus process. It also unites the state of all their message queues underneath that consensus process.That also turns out to be very useful tool for scalability, although that is not initially the goal of interoperability, but it turns out that this solution to the interoperability problem also plays very nicely with scalability. Then you can get something like hierarchical chains and forms of sharding very easily under that same model of uniting distinct and heterogeneous state transitions under the same consensus process.Please see also the following Web3 Summit reports:Five reasons why Tezos rocks!Ewald Hesse, Energy Web FoundationIf you found value in this article, please \u201cclap\u201d (up to 50 times).This article is part of our Tokyo FinTech Publication, please follow us to read more from our writers, like hundreds of readers do every day.

I teamed up with Tobia De Angelis, founder of D1 Labs, to formalize this deep dive (Twitter disagreements can be great). Our focus: the UX/UI design approaches to both Bitcoin and Web3.Our initial starting point kicked off with a survey to better understand user perception and priorities. This survey was sent to ~100 people (though not statistically relevant; respondents are entirely focused on building/investing in crypto).Survey Findings & Commentary1) Are you supportive and or interested in: Bitcoin, Web3/Ethereum, Both?20% solely interested in Bitcoin4% solely interested in web3/Ethereum2% interested in noneThe vast majority (73%) were supportive/ interested in both Bitcoin and Web3/Ethereum.2) How would you define the relationship between Bitcoin & Web3?Commentary: only a small number of people actually think web3 and bitcoin are truly competitors.3) Are Bitcoin and Web3\u2019s success correlated?Commentary: It was interesting to see a nearly identical split saying yes or no. Results to this answer are beginning of confirmation that users have different ideas of success for Bitcoin and Web3.4) When designing products that aim to contribute to Bitcoin\u2019s success, one should focus on:Commentary: We expected security to be top choice, but better UX/UI in the form of ease of use is top priority. Security close behind.5) When designing products that aim contribute to Web3/Ethereum success, the most important thing to focus on:Commentary: ease of use, smoothness take the top spot for web3 which was no surprise. We think we\u2019re in the early days of unearthing use cases of smart contracts, so glad to see creativity was close to the top.6) For Bitcoin: how acceptable is to trade security/privacy at the app layer for a smoother UX? (0 -10 scale)Commentary: We probably should have used a 1\u20135 scale here. 0,5, and 10 had most votes \u2014 0 outweighed 10 quite heavily, ie Bitcoin users do not want to sacrifice security.7) For Web3/Ethereum: how acceptable is it to trade security/privacy at the application layer for a smoother UX?Commentary: we were surprised there was a lower than expected average (4.85), especially after answers on Question 5. In web3, security is still very important from users eyes.8) For Bitcoin: a global, widespread popular adoption is necessary for it to succeed.Commentary: Bitcoin camp was essentially split on thinking widespread adoption was necessary for Bitcoin\u2019s success.9) For Web3/Ethereum: a global, widespread popular adoption is necessary for it to succeed.Commentary: Web3 camp prioritizes global adoption more than Bitcoin camp. We were surprised to see the larger than expected (32%) say that web3 does not need to be global.10) A successful Bitcoin looks likeCommentary: Bitcoin\u2019s narrative is increasingly moving towards \u201cstore of value and payment network\u201d, with only a collective 16% viewing as base layer for applications.11) A successful Web3/Ethereum looks likeCommentary: Web3 as a store of value had almost no votes, with the vast majority excited about web3 being a base layer for applications (generalized, and financial).12) Pick the two \u201cweb3\u201d platforms you\u2019re most excited about (if you\u2019re a maximalist, pick one)Commentary: This was more of a fun question to gauge where people were excited. Ethereum is the runaway winner, surprised to see so many people excited about unnamed \u201cother\u201d. To note: participants chose multiple options here.13) Pick the 2 \u201ccoins\u201d you\u2019re most excited about (if you\u2019re a maximalist, pick one)Commentary: Bitcoin, to no surprise was the top maximalist choice. It was interesting to see that ZCash had more excitement than Monero given similar value propositions. Our take: participants care about global store of value and privacy.ConclusionThis research is a starting point in understanding user perceptions of crypto by focusing on UX/UI and what success may look like. Based off the results, it\u2019s pretty clear that Bitcoin and Web3 are perceived to have separate narratives, alongside disparate concepts of \u201csuccess\u201d.Having a clear understanding of both the social layer and the corresponding protocol/tech layer for Bitcoin and Web3 is crucial to design successful products that meet user expectations. Our goal is to highlight resources, create a community for existing crypto participants, and the next wave of developers and application builders in the space.We\u2019d love your thoughts and feedback.

It is the economic layer that organizes the buyers and sellers \u2014 the customers, retailers, and service providers \u2014 and makes the whole network worthwhile for all participants. This tokenized SaaS system will provide end users with the software they need, to do what they need to do, at a great price!CARD stands for \u201cCustomer Acceptance and Revenue Distribution\u201d, which are the two basic components of the protocol:\u201cCustomer Acceptance\u201d (CA) means that we want to have a network where ecosystem participants welcome and serve mutual customers without payment and billing friction. Once you are part of this network, you accept CARD; you accept the Cardstack Ecosystem\u2019s built-in mechanism for coordinating customer memberships as well as payment and billing. This is similar to accepting Visa cards. Once you accept CARD, you get a seamless experience for your users.In return, you get a part of the \u201cRevenue Distribution\u201d (RD). You receive the correct portion of the overall revenue, sharing the risks or rewards. Rewards and risks are inherent in any type of business. If you pool together and share customers, you get paid \u2014 when someone is using your services, redeeming miles in your airline, using your lounges, taking classes in your yoga studio. You want to make sure that, when you open your doors to the people who hold a membership card or use this payment method or honor this coupon or prepaid card, you will actually get paid for the services you provide, because you are part of this network.Basic concept: prepaid card (min 2:45)The basic idea of the CARD Protocol centers around a prepaid card. You deposit an amount of value into a prepaid card; then, you can use that prepaid card wherever Cardstack is accepted. A prepaid card has an address, similar to a credit card number. It has an original value; when you buy a prepaid card from a drug store or retailer or corner store, you give them USD 100, for example. But you can\u2019t give a USD 100 bill to the smart contracts on the network \u2014 you have to pay in some sort of token, in order to be able to spend the balance on this prepaid card. This is where SSC come in, Software and Services Coupons. But because CARD can pay for anything that is accepted in this network (not just software and services), we have renamed SSC and now call it \u201cSpent Supply Coupon\u201d.In this case, you have spent USD 25.91 so far. The \u00a7 symbol stands for USD 1 cent. The accumulation of how much you have spent is measured in (not pegged to) USD cents. What\u2019s available now is what\u2019s remaining; so, out of your USD 100, you have USD 64.13 left. Note: This number does not entirely add up to 100, because the CARD Protocol manages the exchange rate or the risk of fluctuations of the underlying currency. So, if you pay in Ether, and Ether goes up and down in price, the amount you have to spend may differ. If Ether halves in value, then what is available now could be USD 32; if Ether doubles in value, you could suddenly have USD 90 left. It really depends on what asset you pay with to create the prepaid card. We remember what you paid with and when you paid with it, figure out what it\u2019s worth now, and adjust the available balance accordingly.This is a little different than prepaid cards or gift cards you buy in a store, because those are typically pegged to the currency of the country those cards were issued in \u2014 whether it\u2019s USD or British Pounds or Euros. But with a prepaid card that is based on the token ecosystem, it\u2019s very important to both make it easy for people to understand what\u2019s going on and provide the capability to be fair.So, the customer buys this prepaid card, deposits value, gets original value, and spends it. We figure out what\u2019s left, based on calculations of the market value of the underlying asset that generates this prepaid card. Then, the service providers \u2014 those who are willing to accept CARD and provide a service \u2014 say, \u201cYou have USD 64 left. You can store this large video on my server or use my protocol or my smart-contract network and pay gas fees.\u201d And when the users have actually used that service, the service providers deduct from the users\u2019 balance, by adding to the spent records.The reason we use USD to express it is not because we\u2019re pegging the value of the prepaid card to USD. We just do the accounting in USD, for ease of reasoning; people roughly know what a USD is worth, in terms of storage and smart contract fees.Multiple services \u2014 whether that\u2019s a traditional app charging you five bucks a month for subscription, a dApp charging you a fee when you do something, or an API charging you 10 cents for every 1,000 API calls \u2014 can say, \u201cWhen you have this prepaid card and we establish an agreement, we\u2019ll just deduct from it.\u201d So, this prepaid card is not just like a gift card for an electronic store, which is the only place where you can spend it; it\u2019s more like a Visa gift card, which anybody will accept. And that\u2019s a broader network than just saying, \u201cI have purchased this particular credit for this airline.\u201d It\u2019s more like something that has fungibility across the Alliance network. People\u2019s acceptance of this means that they are willing to implement or have implemented a protocol to deduct from this balance in a standard way.What\u2019s nice about prepaid cards is that you can buy them in person. You can say, \u201cI would like to buy a USD 50 gift card,\u201d and a retailer will sell it to you. In the traditional prepaid card market, those retailers are corner stores, big-box stores, or even pharmacies that sell you a non-refundable Visa gift card, for example, which you can reload at the cash register. At Cardstack, we have this concept of a retailer too, who has prepaid cards available in different denominations. In the crypto market, those retailers are online merchants who have access to blockchain and can obtain cryptocurrencies / tokens through mining or trading. They help customers reload their prepaid balance in the CARD Protocol, and the customers pay them in whatever currency the retailers accept, which will likely be something like credit cards, PayPal, Venmo, or WeChat Pay. This is like topping off a game card they sell, which you can activate and add to your account. So, prepaid cards are the simplest concept within the Cardstack Ecosystem; but there are many more things you can do, which we will talk about later.So that\u2019s the basic idea: A customer buys a prepaid card. The service provider, who accepts the CARD Protocol, can deduct from this card \u2014 without having to set up a new subscription or get credit cards involved. The prepaid card is a store balance that will facilitate the providing of services on the Cardstack Network.Acceptance network (min 8:33)This acceptance network is a very powerful idea \u2014 because, at the end of the day, what credit card has really done is build five or six networks (Visa and Mastercard in the West; American Express in the US and beyond; Alipay and WeChat Pay in China), which are all acceptance networks.What we want to be able to do is this: Customers hold different types of currency. Sometimes, that\u2019s fiat currency; most people have a credit card or even cash. That can be converted into cryptocurrency. The idea is that a prepaid card is pegged to a currency we can measure with a smart contract in a protocol network. Obviously, we need a native measurement and accounting unit within the CARD Protocol \u2014 the CARD Token serves that purpose. And if you put in USD and ETH, we\u2019ll measure how much it is worth, based on the exchange rate at the time of the creation of the card, the time the service was performed, and the time the merchant or service provider can withdraw the money. We essentially share the risk, depending on when that happens. We do the right thing. If the currency went up tremendously, we would try to make sure that whoever holds the token (or the pegged value of the token) at that particular time benefits or is protected from the fluctuation.Because these tokens, which are backed by a prepaid card, can be redeemed by the merchants or service providers, they can look at this \u201cavailable now\u201d balance and say, \u201cI know that there is this amount of underlying assets\u201d \u2014 whether it\u2019s crypto or fiat (fiat will be represented by a stable coin) \u2014 \u201cand that I can safely provide a service, knowing that the smart contract / the network / the calculation engine will give me the proportion when I want to withdraw this.\u201dAnd these USD 1 cent increments are divisible; so, you can actually bill less than USD 1 cent (we will have as many decimal points as we need). Hosting services or cloud services typically bill no more than USD 1 cent. That allows us to make it more user-friendly and avoid giant numbers like Gwei. We can do something that is human-scale \u2014 roughly USD 1 cent for API calls \u2014 as a way to grok what\u2019s going on.A lot of what we are trying to do is lift the standards of understanding away from the low-level crypto protocol and even payment systems, and say, \u201cAll you have to do is understand this card, this idea of this physical card.\u201d By the way, this prepaid card is rendered using the Card SDK; so, it synthesizes data from on-chain data, from the smart contract, from exchange rates, caches it, and aggregates user history. We\u2019ll get more into detail about how that works using Cardstack as a framework, a hub, and a development toolkit for the UI. But this is not just looking at Web 3.0 and looking at a dApp. This is actually a synthesis of much information \u2014 but in a way that\u2019s easy for the user to understand.So, the acceptance network is what we are trying to build, using this prepaid card as the first type of card you can issue in this network.Overall schematics: introduction (min 11:50)In addition to the customer and the service provider, there are four other concepts. The retailer is someone who sells you the card with the prepaid balance. The token pool or value pool is where all the cards, Ether, USD-pegged coins, and CARD tokens are pooled together; it exists on a smart contract that you can look at and say, \u201cHow much is in this network across all these cards that are being issued?\u201d Then, we\u2019re going to do usage accounting \u2014 how many times has someone redeemed USD 10 or 15 cents and what kinds of service were provided (not only by one service provider, but by all of them)? As for the Tally workers: Since a lot of this requires conversion rates, aggregation, calculating proportions, etc., there has to be quite a bit of analytics performed on the data that is available (the customers\u2019 data, the usage accounting, the token pool, the retailers), to determine what everybody\u2019s getting. The Tally worker informs not only what\u2019s on the prepaid card; but when a service provider says, \u201cI would like to withdraw the money every month, so that I can diversify it or use it to pay my employees,\u201d the Tally worker is the accountant or the bookkeeper who says, \u201cOkay, you\u2019ve charged people this much money, and based on exchange rates, this is how much you can redeem right now.\u201dOverall schematics: the 6 players in the system (min 13:19)The customer uses the prepaid card to pay the service provider \u2014 that\u2019s the first relationship. To do that, the customer is either directly or indirectly staking / putting / depositing a certain amount of value or assets into the token pool, which is based on smart contracts. If the customer does not have cryptocurrency (which 99.99% of humanity does not possess directly or even indirectly through exchanges), we want to leverage an existing retail network \u2014 it could be e-commerce or it could be in-person \u2014 to sell these prepaid cards. When they give users the prepaid cards, the staking is done by the retailers. This means: The retailers can sell these prepaid cards and give people access to the underlying network, without having the customers deal directly with tokens themselves. Finally, the Tally workers mark the prepaid cards, the value, and the spend history to the market \u2014 so that everybody knows how much something is worth, how much they can deposit, how much that deposit is worth, and how much can be withdrawn. The usage accounting is a part of the network that\u2019s done partially on-chain and off-chain. So: Use, pay, stake, sell, meter, and mark.Technical mechanics in detail: workflows between the 6 players (min 15:17)A lot of times, when people think of protocols, they focus too much on the technical aspects of how to implement a step in the protocol; they are not really thinking about the interaction between players \u2014 what they care about, what they want to do, and what the risks and rewards of performing those actions are. So, what we\u2019re going to focus on is the workflow between the different parties: customers, service providers, card retailers, token pools, usage accounting, and Tally workers.Mark to marketLet\u2019s start with what cryptocurrency people understand as a token ecosystem. The simplest way to use a token is to interact with a smart contract. In this case, we have two different types of smart contracts on-chain \u2014 the token pool and the accounting. It could be layer 1 or layer 2, but they are essentially blockchain-type technology. The other people (the retailer, the customer, the Tally worker, the service provider) are basically running their UI or APIs or systems and services in the cloud. We have designed the Cardstack Hub so that it contains all the code, modules, and functionality for the customer, Tally worker, service provider, and card retailer to do the work. So, most of what we\u2019re talking about is running the back-end Cardstack Hub; we spent a lot of time designing it, so it can interact with a fairly narrow set of capabilities that we\u2019re going to put on-chain, and still achieve the prepaid card and other derivations of that.The simplest thing a customer can do is use the UI. In Card Folio, we provide a UI for you to transfer tokens: You deposit a token and say, \u201cI would like to pay you 10 bucks.\u201d Then, you transfer that from one account to the other account, to the service provider; and when that deposit (btw: this was the way we conducted the token event) reaches the smart contract, we automatically trigger the provision of service \u2014 that could be granting access to dashboards, creating new entries in databases, or unlocking a domain name for you to start using under your name. So, the service provider runs the Cardstack Hub, listens to all the changes in the smart contract (in this case, the ERC20 contract of the CARD token), and provides the service.This is very simple. It is about the integration of the UI and API tiers, running the Cardstack Hub, using the smart contract as a way to translate this message and as proof that something has happened, and using that to govern access control and on/off switches (in some cases, it can be more sophisticated, like taking smart contracts and creating new profile pages or generating new off-chain transactions).That\u2019s what we have been building so far. What we are adding on top of that capability is the idea of a token pool. Customers usually deal with not only one service provider; their catalog of cards may touch many service providers, with some of them providing APIs to give them exchange rates, some doing storage, some doing video conversion, and some doing it on-chain, while others are doing it in a cloud. Our approach to this is similar to the way people deal with multi-signature contracts. They just say, \u201clet\u2019s pool our funds together into a group account,\u201d and that\u2019s what the reward pool is. We\u2019re building this additional smart contract, called a \u201creward pool,\u201d that allows customers to deposit and withdraw the tokens in this shared way. In America, we tip waiters and waitresses, who pool their funds together by putting their tips inside a jar; and that\u2019s what the reward pool is at the end of the night, when they determine (based on some usage accounting) what portion of this tip jar or this reward should go to each person. That\u2019s the basic idea. We just pool funds together and delay the settlement.These token pools are secured inside an on-chain smart contract. The flow of tokens between the pools works like this: When external value (such as DAI) comes into the reserve pool, CARD tokens are moved out of the reserve pool and into the reward pool, so as to convert this reserve into circulating value. These movements are controlled by the logic of the smart contract and happen automatically on-chain. We take utmost care in the design of the smart contract, leverage best practices, and use well-tested libraries like OpenZeppelin as building blocks. Before the smart contract goes on mainnet, multiple rounds of third-party security audit will be performed to ensure the safety of the pooled tokens.Along the way, we need to know how much that reward pool is worth, assuming that the token is not just one token. One token will fluctuate; but if you have multiple tokens (like Ether, Bitcoin, and CARD tokens) inside this reward pool, it\u2019s going to be very hard to know how much it is worth. So, we take the on-chain transaction history and send it to the Tally workers \u2014 the people who are monitoring everything (Tally workers are actually pieces of software, but you can imagine them acting like accountants). They know what transactions are going on; and because Tally is running on the Cardstack Hub, it can access services that provide cryptocurrency-to-fiat-currency exchange rates on a given day or time, so it can figure out what the current market rate of the pool would be. That allows us to know more than just the token balance and smart contracts, in terms of what the network is worth.Once we know what the network is worth, we can start measuring and sending things out to users, telling them how much they have and what they can spend, in an easily understandable denomination like USD. So, when you deposit the token in the reward pool, we generate this idea of a prepaid card, which is backed by something called SSC (a spent supply coupon account), to show you how much money you have spent and how much you can still spend. That\u2019s the creation of a ledger in usage accounting. In the old days, this would be a punch card (you bought 20 of something, and every time you used one, you punched one of them). So, this is creating a blank card that will keep track of your usage.Now, we know what the current value of the underlying tokens is. With the prepaid card (the SSC account that has been created), we can tell each user how much has been used, assuming that some usage has already been done; if you haven\u2019t used anything, but staked a currency that\u2019s fluctuating (which will be marked-to-market), the \u201cavailable now\u201d balance will go up and down with the underlying asset of the prepaid card.CLUTCH mechanismPeople who do not have tokens to deposit can just buy a prepaid card from a retailer \u2014 instead of buying the token, they can buy usage via the prepaid card, which allows them to use the network. So, as a customer, you go to the retailer, who offers you a card. You can buy this prepaid-usage coupon with a minimum of USD 5, for example. What happens afterwards is what the people in the Ethereum space or broader ecosystem call \u201cdecentralized finance.\u201d But we\u2019re trying to do this in a way that is not specific to a particular ecosystem. This can be done in any type of back-end or service that is being used. So, the retailer receives USD 5 \u2014 either in cash or through a credit card API \u2014 from the customer. Now, the retailer needs to get those USD 5 into the token pool, which he does by buying USD-pegged coins. Based on the currency the user is bringing in, the retailer will buy a pegged coin from a centralized or decentralized exchange, which he will then deposit and lock in the \u201creserve pool\u201d on behalf of the user / the customer. The reserve pool is another part of the token smart contract that locks up these coins, noting that this amount has been deposited. We do native measurement and movement in CARD tokens. Think about that as the membership reward points from American Express or the ultimate reward points from Chase, which you can transfer. In the Cardstack network, the CARD tokens are in the reward pool.We need to take the reserve pool and see how much value has been put in there. Using the exchange rate provided by the Tally workers, we calculate how many CARD tokens to put into the reward pool. We\u2019re trying to keep the value balanced, so that you put something in, you take something out, and you put it in the reward pool. Now the reward pool is funded with the tokens \u2014 this would be as if the customers had their own CARD tokens, but instead, they\u2019re going through a retailer to do that operation for them.This is what we call the CLUTCH mechanism. The idea is that someone is doing this operation for you. Unlike other tokens that you put in yourself, you can\u2019t withdraw these tokens; you have put them into this pool for the service providers to redeem when they perform the service. It\u2019s a one-time non-transferable purchase. Yet, any person in this network would know that the reward pool just grew by USD 5, which allows them to perform up to 5 USD worth of service. This also allows us to calculate bonuses. It\u2019s like saying, \u201cIf you buy some points today for this airline, you get a bonus of 20 percent.\u201d We can do that to incentivize people to make deposits, to use the network. And that\u2019s one of the nice things about having the CARD token as a native token: We can incentivize customers, service providers, and retailers, showing that it makes sense for them to use this network, to begin forming this acceptance network \u2014 knowing that, the earlier they participate, the more value they\u2019re going to get, by earning bonuses for doing the right things. Credit cards do this too, offering 1,000 points of sign-up balance when the cards first launch, which later becomes 25,000, because they\u2019ve got the users, they\u2019ve got the network effects going, so they will reduce the bonus. And we\u2019re going to follow a similar launch strategy for point systems.Payment authorizationNow, we have a reward pool for customers who deposit directly or through a retailer. The next step is for the service providers to start looking at this reward pool and say, \u201cI want to serve these customers, because they have value in this pool, and if I provide the service, I will get some part of it.\u201d The first thing they need to do is sign up. We have to make sure they are taking some risk. So, they\u2019re staking some amount of CARD tokens (the native governance token of the system). They say, \u201cI want to deposit USD 1,000, so I can bill up to USD 1,000.\u201d This way, if there are some weird shenanigans going on, we can slash their stake and either refund the customer or replenish the reward pool for the good performers (the people who are doing things correctly). So, the service providers create an account or an entry within a smart contract; having staked some amount of tokens as protection, they can now perform the services. The ratio of how much stake you need to perform how much service you can bill for can be adjusted on-chain and evolve, as the smart contract gets smarter. But that\u2019s the basic idea. You have something at stake before you start serving customers, so that, if you provide really bad services or you try to just bill people, then there are ways for us to pull that back and say, \u201cYou\u2019re doing the wrong thing, I\u2019ll slash your stake.\u201d But generally speaking, once you put your stake in, you are part of this database or part of this ledger, and people can start working with you.When a customer says, \u201cI would like to start using this Web host who accepts CARD as my hosting service,\u201d he will have to go to a Tally worker and say, \u201cI would like to create a payment authorization for my chosen service provider.\u201d This is like saying, \u201cHow much value in USD can I send to the service provider; how much can I give him the ability to deduct against?\u201d Then, the Tally worker says, \u201cBased on the market value and the volatility of the underlying asset, you can spend USD 64.13.\u201d If the asset is very volatile, the authorization could be for less than that, maybe USD 40. So, the Tally worker uses a formula; whether that\u2019s simple statistics or machine learning in the future, or it could be CPU Database, which is what the current generation of Tally is using, but it could also use GPU as a way to accelerate certain types of detection to say, \u201cGiven that we know everything that\u2019s going to the network and we know the exchange rate \u2014 how much can we authorize?\u201d That authorization becomes billable usage up to the available amount; and that authorization is handed to a service provider, but not on-chain.The service provider can then accept that authorization to enable billing. He uses that balance and the provable usage data, using off-chain calculation (but cryptographic in origin), to say, \u201cHere\u2019s usage: The customer had USD 5 and did this or that, played this game, etc.,\u201d and then that spending history accumulates for the service provider. That\u2019s how the customer spends.When it\u2019s done, that usage data continues to go to the Tally worker, allowing us to deduct the actual value \u2014 what\u2019s been used up. So the spent (the 2,591) keeps going up as the service is accumulating, while the available balance goes down. That allows us to update the UI and prevent you from authorizing too many payments. You can only get one authorization, which Tally uses as underlying data. This is pretty close to how credit card systems work. And delayed settlement allows us to do micro-transactions, especially with long-term billing relationships, which is what we want to facilitate.WithdrawalsThe last step is withdrawal. When the service provider wants to withdraw, he goes to the Tally worker and says, \u201cLook at not only what one customer is spending, but all the customers (there could be a million customers, each with different prepaid cards and balances). How much can I withdraw?\u201d And it works in a similar way. The Tally worker would say, \u201cYou can withdraw up to this withdrawal limit. You can forward the authorization to the accounting system, which allows you to see how much SSC you have. And then, through a side-chain main-net protocol, you can redeem the CARD tokens and get them transferred to your particular wallet.\u201dThe Tally worker\u2019s mark-to-market workflow is colored green in this diagram. The CLUTCH mechanism \u2014 the ability for someone to get you into the token ecosystem via a prepaid card, instead of asking you to hold tokens yourself \u2014 is purple. The payment authorization workflow is orange. And the withdrawal workflow is yellow.This is our overall plan for the network. We\u2019re going to take incremental steps, starting from a smart contract and Tally, and working our way out to authorization and machine learning, to determine and adjust for risks in the overall network.One of the nice things to note is that Cardstack is running all the complicated stuff. What\u2019s going on in the token pool (depositing tokens and creating an account) is basic smart-contract stuff. Most of the really interesting layers are actually implemented using our functional reactive properties in the Cardstack Hub. That\u2019s one of the reasons we felt like we need to do a lot of work in making sure the hub can do this processing logic and, more importantly, all these API calls \u2014 like requesting authorization, purchasing, and forwarding things. That\u2019s all protocol done in the Web way. It\u2019s protocol that\u2019s done in the middleware in the API. It influences (using cryptographic primitives) what goes on-chain. Some things get validated on-chain before getting distributed. But a lot of the protocol is actually what we call \u201ccloud protocol\u201d \u2014 and that\u2019s totally fine. PayPal is a 100% cloud protocol. You can look at Stripe, doing credit card payments, as a protocol, but it\u2019s all done in the cloud. So, the idea here is a mix of on-chain and off-chain, to create that user experience and illusion.Use cases for payment cards (min 31:52)With this type of infrastructure, we can do quite a bit more, using the CARD Protocol.You can have a Game Card \u2014 a card that\u2019s denominated in the in-game currency. It\u2019s not pegged to anything; it\u2019s just something you can use. And you don\u2019t really need to mark it to market, because it\u2019s just the native currency. So, you can use the CARD Protocol for usage billing and the underlying SSC as a way to measure it.Many new users want to use dApps, but don\u2019t have any Ether, so they can\u2019t pay gas. A dApp can provide a Gas Card \u2014 that\u2019s just like a card for you to fill up your gas if you\u2019re doing delivery for a company. This allows the users to be subsidized, to have a certain amount of Gwei to use over time. But you\u2019re not giving the person Ether. This is non-transferable; the amount can only be used through meta-transactions and other types of funding mechanisms, where we are only going to pay people who are providing transactions and putting things on mainnet, for example. You can\u2019t just sign up for 100 accounts and get several Gas Cards to accumulate a nice number of ETH. This is a non-transferable spend-for-transaction-only Gas Card. It could be implemented in different ways, with meta-transaction relayers; and we\u2019re also working on something called \u201ctransaction refueling,\u201d which basically means that we deposit in an address that is multi-sig-controlled.Someone could sell you such a card, but it could also be a gift as part of a free trial. The Free Trial Card can be denominated in the local token. This would be similar in concept to what companies and entities and protocols are trying to do \u2014 how could people try out your service without having tokens? This would be another non-transferable way of doing it; so, they can\u2019t trade or sell it, they can only use it to redeem services. It\u2019s about this idea of signing up and then getting a balance that is non-transferable, using the CLUTCH mechanism \u2014 it can only be spent for services, it cannot be extracted or withdrawn in a more traditional token way. This could be a good way to make sure that people don\u2019t pull these tokens together for financial gain, but actually try out the service and learn what the network means.On the other hand, when customers or workers (people who are working in your network) are doing something very valuable \u2014 facilitating usage, facilitating the network \u2014 they can be given a Reward Card. This reward is something that is earned with action; it\u2019s what we call \u201cquantifiable work.\u201d It\u2019s about thanking someone for their work through an extra bonus. And that can actually be something that can be redeemed directly in the network. So, you can use these earned rewards almost like a credit card reward to earn more flights or other things. But it can also be transferred out, because it is proof of useful work; it is something that people have done real work to deserve, it\u2019s not just a vehicle for moving numbers around. Those people should be able to say, \u201cHere\u2019s an invoice. This is what I\u2019ve done for the network and I got USD 13.19 worth of value from that.\u201dAs users start having ongoing relationships with service providers, it makes sense for them to switch from pay-as-you-go and micro-transactions to subscription. It\u2019s worth USD 5 a month for them to be a charter member of this network. That just means that the deposit, which goes into the reward pool, is ongoing. The user automatically puts in USD 5 to repeat the payment to the retailer, either through a credit card transaction or through an allowance to a smart contract. Ultimately, that subscription is what we\u2019re trying to do. But the concept of a prepaid card helps us understand the basic operating principle of what the Cardstack Ecosystem is. The Subscription Card is just another type of card that automates certain processes, so you don\u2019t have to do it every month and you don\u2019t have to top it off, for example.Payment cards & the UI / Card SDK (min 36:21)You can even prepay this stuff. The idea is that all these things are \u201cvalue in\u201d \u2014 whether it\u2019s gifted or earned or purchased by the different participants in our network. With our UI, you just double-click on a card and you see what\u2019s going on; it\u2019s almost like opening up a wallet on your smartphone \u2014 very easy to do.The Card SDK is our front-end technology and the way we create the schema, the model, and the templates for these things. We always intended for these kinds of identity, payment, and membership cards to be an integral part of how we unlock the value of this software and services network. After all, you can make Content Cards, Data Cards, and Asset Cards. But if people are just using your app for free and you have to find a way to bill them for it (maybe charge them a transaction fee, hold their wallet, or put ads on them), then it\u2019s hard to make the Web a real ecosystem; because the websites you\u2019re using are not really serving you, they\u2019re serving the advertisers. By having Reward Cards, Subscription Cards, and Prepaid Cards \u2014 at the core of which is the same SDK \u2014 we can find a way to say, \u201cYou\u2019ve earned USD 13.19, which you can use to pay for a subscription, which costs USD 5 a month. And by the way, you still have a USD 64.30 balance, which you can use as spendable balance to bill the network.\u201dDeposits & withdrawals (min 37:48)This is a six-sided thing centering around the reward pool, the locked reserve (where non-CARD tokens are locked to back the value of the services, being contributed to the reward pool through this automated balancing mechanism we\u2019re doing on-chain), and the rendered services (the billable usage). Between the billable usage and the deposits (which the users can make themselves, or they can have retailers make them on their behalf) are the purchases (the actual new value coming into the network), the market rates (telling everybody what the deposits and earnings are worth), and eventually, the withdrawals (you could withdraw directly to a wallet or through the Card SDK and the integration with the Cardstack Hub; you could also use financial intermediaries, whether that\u2019s traditional or crypto ones, which provide services where things get deposited directly to your bank account, Venmo account, or even Libra Coin, if that\u2019s what you want to do). But the idea here is that the interaction with the protocol is basically just like a cloud subscription. Everything\u2019s happening in the background, deducting against your balance, until you say, \u201cI want to take the money out and make a deposit,\u201d to interact with what we know as the banking or crypto or financial service organizations.Product grid of providers, developers, users (min 39:49)That\u2019s how the Card SDK (the UI and the logic), the CARD Protocol, and the Cardstack Hub are doing a lot of the calculation and analysis \u2014 serving as the basic runtime for Tally, for retailers, and for service providers (who are providing all kinds of services, from database to courier services). That\u2019s been our basic technical framework. Hopefully, the CARD Protocol \u2014 which sits in the middle, allowing users to use multiple types of services \u2014 will help coordinate this multi-currency payment and billing network across multiple providers.We\u2019ve been working very hard to not only build the protocol aspects of it, but also think about how this would actually end up being used. We have this idea of a product grid. It\u2019s not really a product line. Other product lines do this for businesses, that for end-users, and this for developers. But in our network, they all overlap. The service providers want to be staking, billing, and getting a reward, and know that a third party (Tally) is telling us how much it is all worth. The developers build on the Card SDK and the hub, so they can also get a portion of the reward. Therefore, the reward is where they overlap.Beta Tally (min 40:36) and Beta Folio (min 44:54)Tally is doing a lot of the work; there are a lot of management levers \u2014 you have to stake and withdraw and create relationships, etc. Folio is less low-level; it\u2019s more like what the user would see. A folio will be similar to the iOS wallet app. You can say, \u201cthis is my mileage card, this is my credit card, this is my prepaid card, this is my Apple card,\u201d and we have a similar concept. Tally is for the provider mostly; it\u2019s more low-level, more of an accounting system. Folio is more like, \u201cHow much money do I have? How much can I spend? What membership do I see?\u201dTally and Folio are works in progress, and we hope to launch the beta very soon. But let\u2019s take a look at some of the work that we\u2019re doing on the template and how it looks.Because of the way the Card SDK works, when we\u2019re building a template, we\u2019re also building an API; so, the same thing that powers the user \u2014 the same logic, the same computation \u2014 also serves data to the oracle, so that on-chain data gets the same approach.In Tally, we have two concepts: One concept is this prepaid card, because we need to mark the card \u2014 the value of the underlying asset \u2014 to the market. The other one is the service provider \u2014 someone who is billing for and accumulating usage across different user bases, charging different users who have different prepaid cards. They will have a page that summarizes what they are doing.In this example, the prepaid card is funded using the Aragon token (ANT). It could be funded using any other token, but in this case, we are using an ERC20 token as a deposit. The available balance has to be some continuous calculation of this stuff, so we created something called SSC ID, which is the account number (a hash of a bunch of stuff), and a subscriber address (who holds this prepaid card?). The usage is accumulated over time, showing how you have used the balance that you have deposited and staked for various types of service. The active service providers show how many service providers you are using. One could be hosting your photos, another one could be dealing with your accounting system, and a third one could be paying gas fees for you. Because of the way Cardstack works, one card can tap into 10 different services and different cards can tap into different crypto networks, so the diversity of this pie chart may change. Finally, you can use this to subscribe to a new service provider.If you take a look at what the providers are doing for you, you see that you\u2019re using Card.Space, which is hosting a website for you, so you can have an on-ramp. Then, there\u2019s Hubs\u2019R\u2019US. They provide Cardstack Hub service and all the things that can be included in plugins \u2014 for which you have been billed USD 11.23 thus far. Then, you can go see the provider details and you can say, \u201cI don\u2019t want to do subscription with you. I want to revoke your ability to bill my account, because you\u2019re overbilling me.\u201d That\u2019s how the consumers / the users / the customers can manage the relationships with the (currently three) active service providers who can bill them.From the service provider\u2019s point of view: These are all the service providers who are listed or who have staked CARD tokens. Their stake determines the limit of how much they can bill. And now, they can go inverse and pivot the other way, data-wise. In this example, Card.Space has 23 subscribers and is billing 15 bucks per month on average. As much as cloud services are growing, this could be a big thing. And that\u2019s the idea here: The service providers manage the customer relationships from their angle and Tally is the neutral, administrative accounting Web dashboard that makes it happen.So that\u2019s Tally. The capability and UI of Tally will be launching soon. And this is actually acting as the oracle to the smart contracts, so that the data that users see in a Tally node is the same data that informs activity on-chain.Folio is a lot simpler than Tally. We want to say, \u201cYou have a prepaid card, you have a membership card, and this is the current balance.\u201d We don\u2019t need to get into a lot of detail. That\u2019s it: You have some assets in Ether and CARD. And you could have a MetaMask wallet, for example; in the future, we will also support other types of wallets, whether that\u2019s Trezor or some of the custodial or non-custodial apps that use it. And we just report to you what the USD value (or whatever value that you\u2019re shown) is, using the mark-to-market and the market oracle.Tally is something that\u2019s new, while we shipped an alpha of Card Folio already, to show the basic capability, and we open-sourced the Card Folio codebase in January; it\u2019s actually powering both Tally, which is more administrative and more complicated, and the new Card Folio. So, these are the two things that will be launching soon! If you have a MetaMask account, you can start using Folio. And to use Tally, you can actually stake to become a service provider and start experimenting. Tally will initially launch on testnet, because there are a token pool and stake pools involved in it, so we want to make sure that those are working correctly. Card Folio is basically a read-only app, like an explorer or wallet. For now, it uses MetaMask for transactions. So that\u2019s going to go on testnet, and you can use that and play with it soon.Smart contract / GitHub (min 46:19)This is an interesting description of the underlying smart contracts. We call it the \u201csmart contracts necessary for the CARD Protocol.\u201d Most of the heavy lifting is actually done in the Cardstack Hub in off-chain land. So there are some parts of the protocol that need to happen: There are contracts and oracles and integration and creating various-level pools, whether it is the reward pool or stake pool or reserve pool.The basic idea here is that we are trying to keep the service area of smart contracts as small as possible. Smart contracts are high-capability, because we\u2019re building this mechanism in Ethereum \u2014 for two reasons: One is that the tools are mature and we\u2019re using the OpenZeppelin library, so it\u2019s upgradable, we can improve it over time. But more importantly, there\u2019s a lot of representation of assets \u2014 stable coins like Dai or USDC or TrueUSD. There is capability for you to participate in the money market; you can take loans against it, if that\u2019s what you want to do. And with this idea of creating a deposit, it makes sense for us to leverage all these other decentralized finance or DeFi innovations and essentially provide a pool \u2014 a smart contract that allows those things to be converted and staked, to create this much more dynamic and user-focused billing mechanism.So, we have the reward pool, the reserve pool, the oracle, and then the active service registry, showing which customers and service providers have a relationship, and that can be cancelled from both sides.The reserve pool and the reward pool are essentially a smart contract that locks these things together and provides capability. The reserve pool is mostly about how many other tokens you\u2019re putting in; it\u2019s kind of a multi-sig wallet. The reward pool is denominated in CARD tokens; and any reserve that is deposited will create the correspondent reward pool. The withdrawal and the payout come from the reward pool. Then, with integration (we hope to integrate with a decentralized exchange like Uniswap and maybe even Kyber), you can automatically convert it back to what you have. And the reserve pool would be there to say, \u201cthis is the total network value that is in the system.\u201d So, the CARD Protocol has these relatively small pieces of modular code that support all the things that are going on in the smart contract, while the smart contract supports the overall protocol.What\u2019s next? (min 48:49)1. Card Folio is the first end user-facing launch pad for new types of cards that tap into and wrap the power of decentralized networks in a composable way. We\u2019re using it to show what you can do with the Cardstack UI, the Card SDK. Right now, we\u2019re doing prepaid cards, because there are a lot of moving pieces; and with prepaid cards, you basically get all the Tally and the usage billing things right. Once you have that, you can use the prepaid card to pay for registering on Ethereum Name Service. You can buy crypto collectables to a degree that make sense, if they are unclutched (if they\u2019re clutched, you can only pay the fees on them). We will be integrating with other DeFis (decentralized finance), DAOs (decentralized organizations), and DID (decentralized identity), taking a look at what\u2019s going on both within the Ethereum space and beyond, like the Decentralized Identity Foundation that Microsoft is sponsoring. And we reflect that stuff in a card way. If it\u2019s a card and it\u2019s built on the Card SDK, Card Folio is like the standard UI for you to visualize all this stuff. The most important thing about Card Folio \u2014 or the Cardstack UI that underlines it \u2014 is that you can wrap the power and then chain this together: \u201cPlease take this and do that with it, and when it\u2019s done, go and send it to this person.\u201d This kind of orchestration allows us to use these basic units as building blocks almost like songs in a playlist; and then, your playlist could decide how to orchestrate everything together. So, Card Folio is for end users.2. Tally is the administrative layer to coordinate the four-sided economy. We want to do as much computation as possible using the functional reactive properties of the Cardstack Hub; so, when you update one cell (almost like in Excel), all the other formulas propagate through the sheets. That\u2019s technically possible in Ethereum, but each time, you have the wait for block time and you have to pay gas, which is not always possible. By doing this off-chain computation in the Cardstack Hub, we can keep all these numbers up-to-date. They\u2019re indexed. And the process is accelerated through databases, Postgres, and all these kinds of JavaScript capability. In the future, we\u2019re going to be tapping into machine learning algorithms, so that the calculation of risk can be done by looking at all this data that is available in the Tally database. Then, we can say, \u201cI believe it\u2019s USD 40 worth of risk,\u201d and that can influence users.What we want to do is interact with the chain with a technique that\u2019s proven. A lot of people are inventing new stuff we keep track of (we just hosted a workshop for state channels). We\u2019re looking at different types of capability. Right now, oracles are the easiest way to do it. But this is not centralized; Tally is running on top of Cardstack, and the Cardstack Hub can run anywhere. So, you can have 50 different Tally nodes in different countries running the same algorithm, performing the same analysis on the same on-chain data. Then, you can choose which one will be your payment or withdrawal authorizer, and they will have some risk. If they tell you they are withdrawing USD 40, but you actually do not have USD 40 worth of value, a Tally worker essentially has to slash the stake as well. Tally workers will become analytic miners \u2014 providing analysis service using the Cardstack Hub\u2019s functional reactive properties. They get chosen either dynamically, randomly, or through a long-term relationship, to provide the service for the different participants of the network, acting as the accountant of this decentralized economy.3. We are going to continuously evolve what\u2019s on-chain and what\u2019s off-chain into what we call the \u201con-chain / off-chain mix\u201d to balance all the qualities that matter in real Web apps: ease, speed, cost, trust model, security, etc.A lot of projects, especially in the Ethereum space, want to do as much as possible on-chain, because that makes sense when you\u2019re dealing with decentralized finance, where you want to have a very accurate on-chain measurement of the underlying assets. When you get into payment systems and membership systems, it\u2019s possible for us to use off-chain techniques and serious cryptographical primitives like SSL and HTTPS (it is not on-chain, but it is cryptographic), to make sure that things are not drifting too far away from what\u2019s been staked on-chain. The key here is that real Web apps \u2014 ones that serve millions of users every day \u2014 need to be easy to use and fast in terms of the UI. They have to be cost-effective, they need to have a decent trust model (what we have right now, with the centralized digital super powers, leaves a little bit to be desired), and obviously, they need to be secure \u2014 not in terms of theoretical security, but in terms of the risk of people losing their funds and stuff like that.This is pretty high-bar. Blockchain and smart contracts have a lot to offer if we inject blockchain in the right part of the ease, speed, cost, trust model, and security qualities. Currently, our spend supply (the accounting ledger for usage) is done using the Cardstack Hub. It would make sense for that to be done in a side chain or plasma chain, so that the different service providers know how much has already been billed. They share that information in a more efficient way than going to a main net \u2014 which is good for large amounts, but not for 20 cents, when your gas fee of recording that small transaction costs 20 cents on a bad day.What\u2019s nice about the CARD Protocol is that we could swap out the implementation to use a plasma chain, if one became available, without changing much of the rest of the protocol. So, we\u2019re going to continue looking at this, analyzing it. Think of Cardstack as the payoff. Cardstack has all these working systems and UI. And we can say, \u201cthat\u2019s ready to go to plasma chain, so let\u2019s switch over to that\u201d; and suddenly, everybody is like, \u201chey, we\u2019re using plasma chain underneath.\u201d It\u2019s almost like saying, \u201cwe\u2019ve switched from the Amazon Web Server to Azure or Google Cloud.\u201d The users who are booking a card don\u2019t really care; they wouldn\u2019t care whether we\u2019re using the plasma / side chain underneath. But between ease, speed, cost, trust model, and security, we will improve by switching to these kinds of protocol when they\u2019re ready to go.Another aspect of it is that we really want to improve the end user experience. We like MetaMask in terms of giving people an understanding of what it means to be a direct participant in this ecosystem (by using MetaMask as their wallet); but for most use cases, for people who are buying a prepaid card, it doesn\u2019t make sense to ask them to use MetaMask to hold their balance. That\u2019s why we want to have a hosted (yet non-custodial) wallet, which balances security and ease and trust. There\u2019s a lot of really nice research on threshold multi-sig and new products coming to the market. We\u2019re keeping an eye on that space and seeing how we can turn that into an abstracted scheme. The goal is that, with Card Key, you can sign your transaction in three different ways \u2014 the traditional MetaMask way, through a Trezor wallet, and maybe using a future type of threshold multi-sig, where you may just use an iPhone plus a hosted service.The goal of Cardstack has always been about bringing the decentralized protocol to the surface, so people can understand the protocol and the composability of the Cardstack UI. Signature, balances, prepaid cards, and relationships with service providers are just different aspects of these units of relationship, and those can all be represented using cards, both on the front-end and as a way to orchestrate the back-end.For us, Cardstack is at the center of this network, and we see the CARD Protocol as the economic layer to make it all worthwhile. People do not just participate in it because they believe in open source or decentralization \u2014 but because this is the best way for them to access the greatest number of customers, the greatest network of collaborators and other businesses, so they can provide seamless service to mutual customers. And hopefully, the CARD logo will become as ubiquitous as a Visa and Mastercard logo, so that everyone says, \u201cThey\u2019re using Cardstack! They accept the CARD Protocol, so they can serve me, and I\u2019m going to get everything I need for a reasonable fee.\u201d This will allow us to build the Web 3.0 that not only has the qualities of the connected Web, but that decentralizes the value part, that decentralizes what is now locked into app stores, including advertising support effects.We will release the source code of our smart contract; but more importantly, we will let people play with it on Rinkeby testnet, as we want to be able to get community feedback on how this is working. Then, the payment mechanism will evolve. As we add more services, more cards, and more community features, it will become more obvious why this prepaid card becomes the pass for all of the things you can do on the decentralized Web.Learn MoreSo what\u2019s the product? \u2014 Cardstack Strategy TalkCard Makers: Who Are They? \u2014 Cardstack Tech TalkWe Need to Decentralize Publishing\u2026 AgainCardstack.comStar Cardstack on GitHub and join our Discord channel or our Telegram group and announcement channel to get all our latest updates.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Token", "Ethereum", "Web3", "Cryptocurrency"]}, {"title": "ETH-Ping \u2014 Let me ping your Ethereum Node!", "post_link": "https://medium.com/quiknode/eth-ping-let-me-ping-your-ethereum-node-42b567296b4c?source=search_post", "author_name": "Gaurav Agrawal", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@gaurav.agrawal", "publish_date": "2019-02-04", "last_modified_date": "2019-02-28", "readtime": "2.10", "claps": 71, "voters": 5, "content": "ETH-Ping \u2014 Let me ping your Ethereum Node!A simple NodeJs Script which checks if your ETH Node is aliveGaurav AgrawalFollowFeb 4 \u00b7 3 min readAt QuikNode, we always think of our customers and the problems they encounter using Web3.

From testing and talking about the card, to our Community Meet-up, it\u2019s been a big month. Here\u2019s what we\u2019ve been up to:An Update on TokenCard ShippingWe\u2019d like to start this newsletter off with an update on launching the TokenCard and Contract Wallet out to the world. We\u2019ve had to push the date back and we want you to understand why.The recent delay is down to amendments we are making to the Contract Wallet, the aim of which is to improve usability and make it future-proof. To date, the version of the Contract Wallet application that we have been using has been an ERC-20-only wallet. Currently, for example, it cannot create DAI by collateralising ETH through the Maker CDP. Given feedback and our knowledge of the market, not being able to work with the CDP was deemed something we needed to address \u2014 we\u2019ve been making changes to ensure that it does.If we were to go live with the current Contract Wallet, users would have to redeploy their Contract Wallet once the newer version had been released. This is a sub-optimal experience for our community, and given that the delay will be a short rather than extended one we\u2019ve decided that it\u2019s better for us to push back the Contract Wallet launch.We\u2019re sorry for any frustrations caused by this and will keep you updated on our progress on this front.

The team has helped many developers build Smart Contracts with openzeppelin-solidity, one most downloaded web3 libraries on NPM (with over 10k downloads every week!). According to Zeppelin\u2019s website:\u201cZeppelinOS is a development platform designed specifically for smart contract projects. It allows for seamless upgrades and provides economic incentives to create a healthy ecosystem of secure applications.\u201dWhat problem does it solve?ZeppelinOS helps developers build upgradable smart contracts using libraries that anyone can use on the Ethereum blockchain. Unlike traditional contracts (which can remain frozen forever on the blockchain, with mistakes, limited functionalities, etc...), ZeppelinOS allows users to opt-in & allow upgrades of contracts, opening the doors to a more sustainable process for developing web3 blockchain projects. With upgrades, we can make iterative releases, quickly add small pieces of functionalities (that we can adjust according to the always changing goals of our users), and of course, we can implement fixes for bugs we had introduced on previous iterations.Building on ZeppelinOSLet\u2019s build an upgradable CrudApp contract! We will deploy CrudApp.sol and then update it while preserving its data\u2026 so let\u2019s start:1- Create a project and install dependenciesmkdir crudcd crudnpm initnpm install --global zos2- Initialize your projectzos init crudThis command will create a zos.json file, which contains all the information about the project. For details about this file, see the configuration files page.The command will also initialize Truffle. So by now, inside the crud directory you should have a package.json file (created by npm), two empty directories named contracts and migrations, a truffle-config.js file (created by zos for Truffle), and a zos.json file (created by zos for ZeppelinOS).3- Add CrudApp.sol contractLet\u2019s add our CurdApp.sol now. We will make some changes in our previous Smart Contract, so let\u2019s understand them:CrudApp.solRemoving Constructor and adding an Initializer\u201cYou can use your Solidity contracts in ZeppelinOS without any modifications, except for their constructors. Due to a requirement of the proxy-based upgradeability system, no constructors can be used in upgradeable contracts. You can read in-depth about the reasons behind this restriction in the ZeppelinOS Upgrades Pattern page.\u201dThis means that, when using a contract within ZeppelinOS, you need to change its constructor into a regular function, typically named initialize, where you run all the setup logic:function initialize(uint256 countryLimit) initializer public {   totalCountries = 0;   limit = countryLimit;}You need to import Initializable.sol too for this to work:import \"zos-lib/contracts/Initializable.sol\";Install Ganache and deploy your projectWe will use Ganache (local blockchain) to deploy our Smart Contract. You can change network settings in truffle-config.js if you want to use a different network. Open a different terminal and run below commands:npm install -g ganache-cliganache-cli --port 9545 --deterministicNow go back to the previous terminal and run below commands to start a session. We are using --network option for local network and --from [address] to provide an Ethereum address (which we are going use to deploy the smart contract). We are using a default Ganache address (you can see it on the Ganache terminal) and we are also using an additional expires flag to define the number of seconds this session will be valid (1 hour in this case).zos session --network local --from 0x1df62f291b2e969fb0849d99d9ce41e2f137006e --expires 3600Now let\u2019s deploy our project:zos pushThis command deploys CrudApp to the local network and prints its address. You can deploy more contracts using add command and they will also get deployed after this command.The push command also creates a zos.dev-<network_id>.json file with all the information about your project in this specific network, including the addresses of the deployed contract implementations in contracts[\"MyContract\"].address. You can read more about this file format in the configuration files section.Upgrade the Projectpush command deploys logic contracts which are not intended to be used directly, so instead we need an upgradable instance (we will cover logic contracts and ZeppelinOS Upgrades Pattern page in our future blogs).Now let\u2019s create an upgradeable instance of our CrudApp.sol:zos create CrudApp --init initialize --args 200The zos create command uses optional --init [function-name] with the function name (which is initialize in our case). You can also pass arguments for this function (which is 200, limitation of countries) in our case. This will also print a Smart Contract address, which we will use while interacting with it.Interacting with the ContractNow let\u2019s interact with our contract and insert some countries. To get to the Truffle console, run below command:npx truffle console --network localYou will now see the Truffle console. Let\u2019s run some commands and insert some countries:truffle(local)> crud = CrudApp.at('<your-contract-address>') truffle(local)> crud.limit()truffle(local)> crud.insert(\"USA\", \"Elizabeth Warren\", 33000000)truffle(local)> crud.getCountry(\"USA\")truffle(local)> crud.getTotalCountries()We have inserted one entry in our Smart Contract. Let\u2019s update our CrudApp!Adding a functionWe will add an extra function at the end of our Smart Contract and update it. So, for now, we already have a getCountry() function\u2026 we will add one more getLeader() function in our Smart Contract.function getLeader(string leaderName) public view returns(string name , string leader , uint256 population){        for(uint256 i =0; i< totalCountries; i++){           if(compareStrings(countries[i].leader, leaderName)){              //emit event              return (countries[i].name , countries[i].leader , countries[i].population);           }       }       revert('Leader not found');   }Now let\u2019s update our Smart Contract. We need to run below commands for that:zos pushzos update CrudAppThis will print a new Smart Contract address which we\u2019ll use for testing our updated contract.Testing updated Smart ContractNow let\u2019s test our Smart Contract. It should preserve our previous data and we can access our new getLeader() function. So let\u2019s interact with our Smart Contract again:truffle(local)> crud = CrudApp.at('<your-contract-address>') truffle(local)> crud.limit()truffle(local)> crud.getTotalCountries()truffle(local)> crud.getLeader(\"Elizabeth Warren\")You will see able to see the results, that the Smart Contract was updated just like any other piece of code. \ud83c\udf70 \u2014 We will build an upgradable ERC-20 token in our next article!ConclusionThough it seems pretty easy, we need to be pretty careful while using ZeppelingOS because of Solidity storage management.

Read the longer intro here: Dfinity In A Nutshell \u2014 A Non Technical IntroductionIn Dominic\u2019s Q&A session, he discussed the history of Web 2.0 companies who have created monopolies and effectively continue to monetize complexity. Centralization creates an incentive to sell more services on top of greater complexity. The vast majority of costs involved in running enterprise IT systems come from human capital. Current monopolies also stifles new innovators since they control the APIs and other channels to operate on the Internet.Nobody today should invest in an internet services that\u2019s not decentralized.-Dominic WilliamsHis alternative is the Web 3.0 system that creates open networks that both lowers the cost of developing and running enterprise applications as well as create incentives for broader innovation as the tokens, or rewards, can be decentralized and distributed to people who contribute the most useful and easiest to use tools and applications. Dominic did not shy away from advocating for an entire paradigm shift away from centralized cloud systems.In response to the question of how Dfinity will attract people to switch from centralized cloud providers to the Dfinity Internet Computer, Dominic argues that new developers will choose a superior service, an open platform where everyone who contribute can share the revenue.Dfinity founder Dominic WilliamsThe punchline: Dfinity is one of the most ambitious projects in the blockchain space and also one of the most well-marketed ones (58k Telegram community). It will be fascinating to see A) how quickly they can develop their technology and B) how they can compete with the biggest Web 2.0 monopolies, worth $ trillions, in the world.", "responses": 1, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Decentralization", "Dfinity", "Silicon Valley", "Web3"]}, {"title": "Announcing Accomplice\u2019s Investment in Coda", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@AccompliceVC/announcing-accomplices-investment-in-coda-e054dd7a540c?source=search_post", "author_name": "Accomplice", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@AccompliceVC", "publish_date": "2019-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2019-04-09", "readtime": "2.40", "claps": 87, "voters": 5, "content": "Announcing Accomplice\u2019s Investment in CodaAccompliceFollowApr 9 \u00b7 3 min readBy Ash Egan, Principal at AccompliceAccomplice is delighted to lead the O(1) Labs Series A fundraise, announced last Friday. Based in San Francisco, O(1) Labs is the team behind Coda Protocol, the first cryptocurrency with a succinct blockchain.Coda is one of the most ambitious projects in the blockchain/crypto space, and has raised a total of $18.5M from our close friends and co-investors at Metastable, Polychain, Paradigm, General Catalyst, Electric Capital, Coinbase Ventures, and blue-chip angel investors Naval Ravikant, Elad Gil, Linda Xie, and Andrew Keys, amongst others. This $15M Series A fundraise provides fuel for a team building the underlying protocol for truly decentralized, scalable, and accessible infrastructure.We believe Coda will be a mainstay in the hotly contested base layer protocol category, based off their deeply technical and talented team, their elegant solution to blockchain scalability and decentralization, and noteworthy traction in a short time frame.Founders Evan Shapiro and Izaak Meckler began building O(1) Labs in 2017 and have since surrounded themselves with a rockstar team of 20, with backgrounds in distributed systems, cryptography, security, application development, and blockchain tooling.Blockchains of TodayAs more and more transactions are stored on base layer blockchains of today, validating transactions and accessing historical transactions has become increasingly difficult for the average participant. Blockchain nodes in existing networks often require hundreds of gigabytes, which has led centralization and high entry costs for new participants. Increased centralization undermines many of the security and censorship-resistant benefits of blockchain systems, a trend opposite to the ethos of blockchain.Succinct Blockchain & Decentralized NodesThe O(1) Labs team is building an elegant solution to the blockchain trilemma \u2014 solving for scalability, decentralization, and protocol security. Coda uses zk-SNARKs (a type of cryptographic zero knowledge proof) to compress the size of the blockchain to 20 kilobytes, or comparable to the size of a single Tweet. By compressing the entire blockchain history into a single SNARK proof, a user can enjoy full node level security for mere kilobytes. Coda\u2019s uniquely low storage requirements drastically decrease block verification to 10 milliseconds and thus allows Coda to be accessible to everyone via nearly any device, including smartphones. Additionally, Coda\u2019s use of decentralized nodes allow every client to effectively operate a full node, enabling network effects that will increase protocol security with every new user \u2014 this is possible as each additional user constitutes another full node verifying the validity of the blockchain.Progress & What\u2019s NextThe O(1) Labs team is shipping protocol updates and products at a remarkable rate. Users can explore Coda\u2019s live Testnet, which has experienced nearly perfect uptime since launching in October. O(1) Labs Ocaml front-end, Snarky is live on Github and allows developers to easily write SNARKs. If you\u2019re interested in staying informed on the latest developments from Coda, sign up for their mailing list.The team at Accomplice is ecstatic to support the O(1) Labs team as they build out Coda\u2019s decentralized infrastructure to enable trustless, global payments at a fraction of their current cost.

Today, it\u2019s still a place for cyber punks and fringe groups\u2013but it\u2019s also an essential part of our everyday lives. At Blockunit, we believe that blockchain technology is today where the internet was in the early \u201890s.Getting to the new internetSince Bitcoin\u2019s birth in 2009, the world has slowly realised the potential of its underlying technology. Everything from finance and accounting to logistics and deeds to public services like voting and governance will be reimagined.But the people behind these projects have realised that to truly make a difference on a global scale, blockchain must go mainstream. We\u2019re talking internet status. That means we need everybody using blockchain technology the same way they use the internet today.And that\u2019s where we come in\u2026Amidst the screams of \u2018When moon? When Lambo?\u2019 from cryptocurrency investors, there\u2019s another movement with a focus on how else blockchain can be used. And how it can improve the lives of billions.By accelerating mainstream use of blockchain technology, we can get there even faster. One of the ways we plan to do that is through education.Why Education?The rise of bitcoin and blockchain originated in the online communities of computer programmers along with phrases like \u2018peer-to-peer\u2019, \u2018decentralisation\u2019 and \u2018byzantine fault tolerant\u2019. Nearly 10 years later, we\u2019re ready to take this technology to the masses, but we need new phrases, relatable analogies and simple explanations. Only then will be see the average woman or man start to understand, get behind and ultimately use blockchain.With our top team of designers, writers and marketers, we\u2019ll build a library of jargon-free content and act as a funnel for those exploring blockchain for the first time.Over the next few months we\u2019ll be publishing introductory articles about blockchain and and updates on our current projects.

McKayFollowApr 7 \u00b7 3 min readCount me out of the fairly widespread opinion in tech these days that digital advertising must die. This argument always boils down to two main complaints:Ads are annoying.They incent evil behavior, especially privacy violations.There\u2019s truth to both these criticisms, of course. But I\u2019d also say they\u2019re both essentially matters of implementation, not inherent characteristics of advertising as a product. Thus both problems should be fixable.It should be possible to build ad software that\u2019s not annoying and evil but still allows people to get paid. This is exactly what the startup Brave and the open-source community around Basic Attention Token (BAT) have been working on, which is why I\u2019ve become such a big fan lately. And they\u2019re not the only ones innovating in this area.I\u2019m also not opposed to other models like subscriptions or events or whatever else that might emerge alongside advertising as strategic options for publishers. The more, the better. I\u2019m just saying that we should very much want ads to remain as a viable choice within that mix.The thing is, ads are uniquely small-d democratic if they\u2019re implemented in a way that actually benefits creators. (More on this important qualifier in a moment.) Because advertisers in such a system are effectively paying to reach the richest, most desirable audience members, everyone (including poorer members of the audience) gets to enjoy the content, which often wouldn\u2019t exist otherwise.Most other models do not replicate this particular dynamic very well. A subscription model, for example, effectively limits access to content to richer readers while shutting out the poorer ones. In turn, this also tends to limit the total reach of creators\u2019 content, which is never desirable. You write or make videos or podcasts or whatever because you want the material seen.The pre-internet era provided great examples of this that are still instructive. For instance, when I was a cub reporter at the Washington Post in the late \u201990s, the weekday paper cost just 25 cents. At the time, the weekday New York Times cost $1, The Wall Street Journal was 75 cents, and USA Today was 50 cents. So the Post was priced well below market value back then, including subscriptions that were essentially derived from the newsstand rate.It was ad revenue that allowed the Post\u2019s publisher at the time, Don Graham, to make up for this, of course. When asked why he didn\u2019t raise the cover price, he would openly tell the staff that he wanted the Post to be accessible to everyone in Washington as their local paper. The 25-cent pricing was a purposeful decision to make the paper affordable for cabbies and cops and housewives, not just the lawyers and lobbyists on Capitol Hill that one might normally think of as Post readers.Since then, Big Tech platforms like Facebook and Google have famously captured the ad market from old-school publishers like the Post. In doing so, they also sometimes express a certain business logic that\u2019s remarkably similar to Graham\u2019s back in the day \u2014 that ad support enables the tech platforms to provide their applications \u201cfree\u201d to end users.What\u2019s been lost, however, is that the ad revenue mostly isn\u2019t going to support journalists, artists, and other actual content creators anymore. The big platforms just hold onto it with paltry pass-along to actual creators. This is the main problem that ultimately needs to be fixed \u2014 the question of who gets paid for the ads, and how.There are many ways to go about addressing that, from regulatory fixes to combat monopoly to market-based solutions like BAT. But we should all want the ad business model to continue awhile longer in some improved form, preserving the old small-d democracy it had at its best. That should be the goal, not blowing the whole thing up entirely.This post originally appeared on Indizr, my blog about Web 3.0.

With QuikNode you can save your developer time without compromising on Node quality or performance. In this article, we will help you to understand why you should use QuikNode.High Volume, Fast TransactionQuikNode infrastructure provides Ethereum nodes with powerful resources and high Internet bandwidth. 8 different zones are supported to minimize network hops and improve latency. With your own QuikNode you can batch multiple transactions and push more transactions in a block compared to any public node.PeersEthereum is a decentralized network, where nodes connect other peer nodes, forming a peer-to-peer network to communicate with each other. With QuikNode, your node will have an optimum number of peers it finds on Ethereum network (up to 50 at a time), which helps propagate your transaction to the network faster and keep your node in sync to the latest block.You can see the number of peers connected to your node on QuikNode\u2019s dashboard and also IPs and other client information of those peer nodes.Scalability and LoadPublic nodes typically throttle with heavy usage. With QuikNode, your Ethereum node is only yours and has no set limits. This is very important for a scalable Dapp/App. Your QuikNode tackles only your Dapp/App load hence improving your Dapp\u2019s user experience. Additionally, QuikNode\u2019s engineers fine-tune your Ethereum node for maximum throughput and performance.Security and PrivacyAt QuikNode, security is of utmost priority. Let\u2019s explore some of the benefits:Your node is accessed through a link only shared with you, hence removing user login for accessing your node. To enhance privacy, we don\u2019t track a particular user.As a user, you don\u2019t need to concern yourself about security as our security engineers take care of this for you.QuikNode uses HTTPS and WSS to increase security.As a business, if you run your own node into your subnet, then you don\u2019t want to allow any unknown IP (Peer Node) into your network. Using QuikNode you don\u2019t need to worry about this problem.MaintenanceEthereum clients such as Parity and Geth are in active development and frequently release new versions. If you run an Ethereum node, you need to upgrade it every time to keep up with the latest patches and features.QuikNode solves this problem for its users. The team continuously monitors updates relevant to your node and applies them automatically. QuikNode engineers also watch for forks and take actions accordingly to safeguard users. This saves a lot of time for you as a developer so you can focus on your application.AnalyticsQuikNode provides awesome analytics for your Ethereum Node. As mentioned above, the metrics UI shows the number of peers connected to your node. Let\u2019s have a quick look at what else you get with QuikNode analytics:Node LogsAverage Load on the Node# of Requests on the Node# of ConnectionsWebSocket MessagesBlock NumberFlexibilityQuikNode supports all mainstream networks (MainNet, Rinkeby, Ropsten, Kovan, Classic) and clients (Geth, Parity), which provides immense flexibility.You can spin up an Ethereum Node on any network and client, and plug it into your application using a Web3 URL (a hashed https:// and wss:// URL is provided inside the UI) in minutes.One can also change networks, clients, and locations with a few clicks. For example, one can launch a Ropsten node on Parity client in Bangalore for development, then switch to MainNet in Amsterdam for production. This saves a lot of time and helps in the testing of your application!ReliabilityThe QuikNode team has been building & maintaining IT infrastructure since the early 2000s (over 40 years combined experience). This helps in creating a safe and reliable Ethereum Node infrastructure. Using the most trusted cloud platforms available today, QuikNode maximizes Ethereum Node uptime, ensures swift deployment and fast network connectivity for best performance.Ethereum Network SecurityRunning a node helps expand and strengthen the network. More nodes = more copies of the blockchain that exist, which also means more peers to distribute block data. Every QuikNode customer is helping himself and at the same time helping make the Ethereum network faster and more immutable.If you can keep a node running that accepts incoming connections, you\u2019ll really be helping the network a lot. \u2014 Satoshi NakamotoEthereum Archive NodeQuikNode also provides Parity Ethereum Archive Nodes. An Archive Node contains all state trie data (all the transaction records that have ever happened) and is generally deployed by advanced users & businesses who need the full blockchain data to play around with \u2014 fast.Normally these Nodes take weeks to sync, however, one can spin up an Archive Node with full Trace Module Data in just a couple of hours!QuikNode WalletAlso included with your Node is a standalone Wallet web-app. The interface is a fork of the popular MyEtherWallet. Using the integrated QuikNode Wallet, you can do things such as sending Ether and ERC20 tokens, signing a transaction, generating a raw transaction, or buying an ENS domain \u2014 which helps both power-users (for interacting with the blockchain) and developers (for testing and smart-contract deployment).This is how it all looks:And these are just some of the hundreds of projects using QuikNode today:Is it worth it?You\u2019re probably wondering how much a QuikNode is. First, just think about how much time and effort you will expend setting everything up (e.g. a cloud account; the requisites and node software using the command line; firewall and security; etc\u2026). Then how long it will take to tune the environment to make it stable and perform at the highest level (e.g. OS kernels, network settings, node config files, etc\u2026). Then, who will maintain it all (updates, forks, crashes, bugs, expanding chain size, etc\u2026)? It\u2019s a full time job!QuikNode saves a lot of time for development teams so they can always focus on application building!QuikNode makes the Node layer virtually invisible for around $150/month. 7-day terms are also available (for those looking to test things first), as well as 3, 6, and 12-month terms at discounts of 10%, 15%, and 20% \u2014 respectively. You can add time to your node whenever you want, inside the Node UI.You want things to \u2018just work\u2019 \u2014 and this is exactly how QuikNode approaches nodes\u2026 simple, powerful, effective. Once you plug in your Web3 URL into your code, you need just to focus on your app and its features.

Cardstack enables makers, storytellers, developers, and designers to form decentralized networks and finally create on their own terms.A s a writer, you lose your baby the moment it gets published. Which is painful, frustrating, and there\u2019s no way around it. Not in a centralized world. You hand over your work to someone else. In the past, this may have been a publishing house that agreed to print your stuff. For a brief moment after the advent of the World Wide Web, individuals started hosting their own home pages and blogs that were directly under their control \u2014 no middlemen. These days, most likely, you will publish on a centralized social media platform \u2014 so we\u2019re back to middlemen. And why would you do that? Because you\u2019ve worked hard on your piece, you feel it is important, and you want people to see it. You want to build an audience for yourself \u2014 a loyal following for your projects, ideas, or business. And taking the help of an intermediary can be useful in achieving that goal; mainly because these platforms promise you a built-in audience that is already eager to find new articles, stories, or books that will be worthy of their time. Sharing your writing with these readers therefore gets you some attention instantly \u2014 at least in theory.In real life, these centralized platforms do much less for you than you initially expect. They may come with a built-in audience, but certainly not with a built-in guarantee that your stuff will be read or make you any money. In fact, not even paying readers get access to all articles on certain platforms; classified stories are reserved for premium memberships (which collect money for the platform, not for you). As a writer, it is tough enough to make money. If you\u2019re any kind of freelance writer, you should definitely have a day job or you will probably starve to death. So, at the very least, you should be the one reaping the rewards for the interesting work you put out there \u2014 both financially and attention-wise. Yet, the traffic that your post may generate \u2014 as people\u2019s Google search for certain topics leads them to your article \u2014 will help the platform more than it helps you. After all, the link goes to the centralized website with its own brand and name, where your article just happens to be located; it makes the platform more popular, but it does next to nothing for you and your own brand. And do you really want people to talk about \u201cone of the articles they saw on this giant web platform\u201d or do you want them to speak about \u201cthe article written by this writer or that company\u201d? Do you want them to remember the platform, or you?So, first of all, you lose your baby in the crowd. It becomes one of many works that may or may not be read by the \u201cbuilt-in\u201d audience your centralized publisher promises. But more importantly: Not only do these platforms not make miracles happen for you; instead, some of them effectively take control over your published work. Once you give it to them, they can do anything they want with it \u2014 steal it, clone it, kill it, and take it from you forever. You don\u2019t have to read the Terms of Service like a lawyer to know that those terms are written in the platform\u2019s favor, not yours.What if they don\u2019t like what you\u2019re saying? What prevents them from simply taking down your article and dropping it in a deep black hole? Too bad, cause you\u2019ll never find it again. What if the site suddenly gets shut down or changes its algorithm, and you haven\u2019t saved your articles anywhere else? Too bad, cause they\u2019re gone; your articles and traffic (aka your audience) have disappeared with the platform. What if they plagiarize and sell your work for profits (their own, of course, cause who forces them to include you in the deal)? Too bad, cause although your work may finally get the exposure you always wanted, you won\u2019t be the one getting paid. And what if, one not so fine day, the platform gets hacked? Too bad! Cause nobody will care that you have just lost everything.So, there it is. As a writer posting in a centralized world, you will lose your baby. Quite literally. You\u2019re giving it away to someone else, trusting that this \u201csomeone\u201d will take proper care of it and give it the attention it needs. In return for a place to publish it and some potential readers, you sacrifice your rights as a writer \u2014 accepting that, ultimately, you no longer own your own work. Someone else owns your stuff; even if they say they don\u2019t. And even if they say they would never ever do anything with it that you don\u2019t approve of, who knows? Because, really, they could. Who would punish them for it? From censorship to plagiarism \u2014 the power these platforms have over your work could be abused at any time. Which basically means: You cannot count on these people. They don\u2019t have their writers\u2019 best interest at heart, but exclusively their own. They\u2019re unpredictable. They may get your creation some attention today and feed it to the wolves tomorrow, who knows? And PS: You may not even notice.Writers have been taken advantage of for way too long, being trapped in the centralized system of publishing platforms. It\u2019s time to turn the tide, decentralize publication, and give writers their power back. Not only that; it\u2019s time to give them everything they need and deserve. This includes the perfect writing and designing tools, the greatest exposure and audience, the fairest rewards, and the control over their own work.At Cardstack, we have taken the first step towards turning this vision into a reality, by creating a decentralized Web publishing system: the \u201cCard Board\u201d application. This app is already open-sourced \u2014 but that is only the beginning. We are working hard to improve Card Board, as it is our goal to use the Cardstack Ecosystem to facilitate a network of creators, who can come together to be their own publishers. With the help of our developer community, we can not only achieve parity with large centralized publishing platforms, but surpass them in every way!The growing toolkit \u2014 when creators share, add, and improveImagine you could actively add to the toolkit of a decentralized Web publishing system, thereby improving the application and getting rewarded in the process. With Card Board, you can! All the writing, formatting, and publishing tools are open-sourced, so you can build on them.The easy-to-use editor built into Card Board \u2014 which is meant to make the writing process, including styling, formatting, and design, a pleasure for every writer \u2014 will get better with each developer who makes an addition to it. Developers can improve the editing options, add new features, and then open-source their self-made tools, by sharing their code and enabling even more people to expand the editor. This way, the tools for publishing articles become better and better, while everyone who enhances Card Board behind the scenes gets rewarded by the system, through the continuous use of our proportional attribution and allocation model.As a writer, you know that the more features you have in your digital pencil case, the more colorful your article or blog post or e-book will be, and the more interest it will spark. Therefore, it would be great to have a self-improving toolkit at your hands, right? One that gets magically filled (by the coders you never see) with a growing number of writing implements, theming options, and other fantastic tools. You don\u2019t have to worry about coding yourself or paying the coders to code for you \u2014 the Cardstack Hub can take care of all that. You don\u2019t even have to think about your data sources; you could insert any audio or video file, not only link out to the few sites your publishing platform supports. Because Cardstack has a plugin mechanism that can connect to everything, you could do anything you like. No need to improvise or settle for anything less than what you really want. This leaves you free to focus on your art.But it gets better. Imagine you had access to an open-source Shutterstock that is neither insanely expensive nor annoyingly separate from your Web editor; a collection of countless pictures, uploaded and shared by writers, photographers, graphic designers, illustrators, and other creators. You wouldn\u2019t have to open a website in a new tab, create an account, confirm that account, find a picture, pay too much for it, download it, and then finally (after what feels like a million steps) insert it into your article.You could even add to this image library yourself, thereby improving the user experience for other writers. Say you take photos of adorable koalas for your \u201cAustralia rocks!\u201d-article, and think to yourself, \u201cWhat if someone else wrote about cute, furry animals? What if that person found my picture in the library, used it, and I got paid for it? Wouldn\u2019t that be awesome?\u201d It would! And who knows \u2014 if people like it, your pictures may make you more famous than your writing ever could. Suddenly, you wouldn\u2019t only be using Card Board, but creating it too.At Cardstack, we want app creation tools to be open and free, so that people can use them, share them, and improve them to their heart\u2019s content \u2014 without blood-sucking centralized platforms taking control of, well, anything. Developers keep ownership of the tools they create just like writers keep ownership of the articles or pictures they publish, while their work gets efficiently propagated to their audiences. Card Board is a win-win \u2014 both developers and writers will be able to derive huge benefits from this decentralized approach to publishing.The rewarding network \u2014 when writers join forces as publishersWouldn\u2019t it be great to be your own publisher, backed by a network that doesn\u2019t absorb all your power and success?Publishing by yourself isn\u2019t easy. As writers know, if you want to have any chance at being successful, your self-publishing efforts require you to put in a lot of knowledge (which you don\u2019t have, unless you\u2019re already an expert in all things publishing, including proofing, layout, sales, distribution, and marketing), plus energy (which you probably want to put into your day job that pays for your writing), time (which there\u2019s never enough of anyway), and money (which there\u2019s never enough of either). Building your own audience of readers is tough when you\u2019re all alone.That\u2019s where the network effects of our Card UI come in: With Cardstack, you can do so much more than just publish on the Web. The key term is syndication!Imagine you could form a powerful artists\u2019 collective. You could create or join a community of writers with a built-in audience \u2014 one that offers you readers, but doesn\u2019t take control of your work in return. Numerous authors could come together to share their pieces with the public in a decentralized way. With no central upper hand. No central power. No central leech.Your shared readership would grow with the art and the network. As more writers join the collective and publish their work, this digital library would become increasingly comprehensive. Finally, readers will be able to search an amazing collection of articles or books, containing countless writers\u2019 pieces; they will find whatever they\u2019re looking for \u2014 whether that\u2019s an essay explaining how grammar can save lives, an article describing 40 ways to rescue socks from the washing machine, or a blog post teaching them how to tie their exes to a tree so they will get eaten by bugs.The literary output of such a writers\u2019 guild would be fantastic for the readers, and even more so for the writers. Just imagine: Every author who joins the network brings his own audience to the table, ready to share. This brings more exposure for everyone, as it continuously grows the reader base. Add all those audiences together and you get a huge readership for the whole community, where all writers have a great shot at being discovered by each other\u2019s followers. Quickly, another author\u2019s 4,000 readers become yours too.And it doesn\u2019t have to end there! By teaming up, you could charge your common audience a membership fee for your writing; a fee to generate revenue that doesn\u2019t go to a platform, but to you, the writers \u2014 the people who actually deserve the money, which would be fairly allocated.Say you charge a fee for the community\u2019s collection of bizarro memoirs. Now, let\u2019s assume you like to write down garbage collectors\u2019 exciting life stories; another author specializes in envelope lickers\u2019 confessions; and a third one focuses on frozen broccoli testers\u2019 memoirs. Since the community of writers would be linked through affiliate agreements, a reader who pays for the garbage collectors would get access to the broccoli testers as well. Based on the number of reads and the traction your garbage men generate, you would get your deserved slice of the revenue-coming-from-memoirs-readers cake.Thus, by forming a syndicate, you would not only aggregate your work, but multiply your readers, and increase your earnings too. Plus, you would stay in control of your art, due to the absence of a self-declared central god who takes the credit, considers the audience his own, and collects your rewards. You wouldn\u2019t have to sacrifice your baby. You could share it, but it remains yours. Your work, your network, your audience, your reward. We want to offer you all the benefits of a centralized publishing platform, but without the drawbacks; furthermore, we aim to provide additional opportunities that a centralized system can\u2019t provide.In summary, Cardstack\u2019s decentralized approach to publishing creates a triangular connection that will benefit the writers and readers as much as the developers, as they build each other up continuously. It comes down to this: The writers share readers, hence grow a common audience. The audience, in turn, pays not the publishing platform, but the writers themselves through their subscription fees. And that\u2019s how the developers, who provide the tools for the writers in the first place, get fairly compensated too. This means total freedom, total control, and fair rewards for everyone involved.This is how you will be able to use the Card Board editor yourselfOur aim is to enable storytellers to write, format, and beautify their work quickly and easily \u2014 with fun, freedom, embedding possibilities, theming options, and all the tools they need. Therefore, Card Board offers what we call an \u201cArticle Card\u201d that consists of many other cards and features, all of which make up the smooth publishing experience we want to offer creators around the world. Our Web publishing system is still in the works, as we are improving the front-end experience; but the following scenario shows you how our editor will work in the future.Say you are a blogger who likes to give travel advice. You want to tell your followers that Europe is the perfect place for snowboarding. First, you pick a cool title and subtitle for your article.Now, you start writing your article paragraph by paragraph, which you can format as you go along, for instance with a \u201cFreeride\u201d font size 47, if you want to make sure even grandparents can read it (although their desire to go snowboarding may be slightly limited).Naturally, you know your audience, and you are well aware that people are lazy. They often prefer nice pictures to actual writing. So, you pick out a pretty image of some ice and snow, or a cute photo of some reindeer licking their ears, by dragging it either from your own computer or from your Cardstack library, and insert it into your article. You place it anywhere you like and adjust the size. You can add a caption to engage your readers, such as, \u201cIf you see reindeer, tie them to a sleigh. Someone really should find out if that actually works.\u201dAnother way to keep your readers excited is to emphasize certain sentences, for instance by use of pull quotes, which is just as simple as dragging and dropping a picture into your article. Simply choose the quote you want to highlight and turn it into a pull quote with one click.To point out interesting facts, you can create a list of bullet points that may even include a link to an external website. This is an easy and straightforward way to give your readers some interesting facts about the place.To keep your readers interested, you may want to include a video or podcast in your article. Now, since there is nothing more exciting than a snowcat (a vehicle named after an animal, hello?), you have already interviewed a snowcat driver. All you need to do now is search your Cardstack Library for your podcasts. Choose your \u201cInterview with Jack Frost\u201d from the recordings you have previously added to your library, and place it into your article. If you don\u2019t like the look of the podcast as part of the bigger picture, you can change the size or replace the image with something else. With one click, you isolate the podcast card, overwrite the image of a snowman with the image of a furry cat taken from your library, and insert it back into the article. Click \u201csave\u201d and move on to writing a caption for your interview, which can serve as a nice introduction to your podcast; for example, to answer the question where the \u201csnowcat\u201d came from in the first place: \u201cOnce, there was a cat. Or a tractor shaped like a cat. Or just a vehicle steered by a cat. Truth is, nobody really knows.\u201d Always keep your readers guessing.Now, you can review your completed article and publish it, so that your followers can choose from your collection of blog posts and be forever grateful for your sound travel advice. Since you own everything you write and publish, your creations \u2014 including the rights associated with them \u2014 remain in your control. You decide where to store your articles, who gets to re-use your articles, who is allowed to copy or embed your articles, and how they can be referenced across the internet. You could even tweet various parts of your article as separate cards, if you feel like sharing specific quotes.By the way, back-ups are part of the deal. You can upload and synchronize your pictures and articles with a server to make sure you never ever lose them. Or, alternatively, your files can be stored safely in a Cardstack lockbox \u2014 a repository to which you (and only you, or whoever else you choose) have the keys.Because it\u2019s about you, the writer. You should be able to compose and style your work easily, so it reflects your personal taste. You should be the one to determine what happens to it. You should be allowed to write anything you want without being afraid of censorship. You shouldn\u2019t have to be afraid of losing your work. And you should get properly credited and paid for it.It\u2019s high time we build a Web 3.0 that gives creators their power over their creations back. We need a decentralized system that keeps them in control, while rewarding them fairly for their art. After all, they are the ones who put their heart and soul into their work, and they deserve much more than what they are getting these days. In order to achieve this, they need to be connected with each other in new, direct, decentralized ways \u2014 which enables them to lead self-sovereign lives and sidestep the vortex of publishing intermediaries, who soak up all the success that should belong to the creators themselves. Card Board is our first step towards achieving that goal, as it will make creators\u2019 lives more fun, more comfortable, more collaborative, more promising, and more rewarding than they could ever be on a centralized publishing platform \u2014 including this one.Learn MoreCloud Apps Are Like Coat Checks: Do you really trust them with your stuff?Introducing Gitchain: Cardstack\u2019s Protocol for Syncing Application StatesBuilding the Card Catalog: Status update & strategy for the Card SDKCardstack.comThis is the first in a series of articles and videos presenting new cards that will gradually be added to the Card Catalog.

Tally is now running on the Rinkeby test network to ensure security, stability, and future scalability.Tally enables the billing workflow in the Cardstack EcosystemTally is a metering and billing network for purchasing Software-as-a-Service in a decentralized way. Essentially, buyers and sellers of services use the software running on Tally to deposit funds and record billable usage. The system interacts with a set of Ethereum smart contracts and provides a multi-currency exchange rate service, enabling customers to pay for services in a variety of cryptocurrencies, including stablecoins. The current test version of Tally is designed for those who have experience interacting with the Ethereum testnet (Rinkeby). Future versions of Tally will be usable by people who do not own cryptocurrency and would like to buy usage credits with fiat currencies or a credit card instead.Software-as-a-Service needs to be decentralizedSaaS platforms are usually owned by giant corporations. Cardstack\u2019s vision is that open-source software will be provided to customers as hosted service by service providers around the world. This is similar to miners around the world running blockchain nodes on their own hardware in exchange for mining rewards, which are a type of hosting fees. We see consumer-facing software follow a similar paradigm, where enterprising service providers cooperate and compete to earn market share for offering high-quality hosting services. Tally is the metering and billing subsystem that enables multiple service providers to bill mutual customers who have funds in their prepaid accounts.Go play around with Tally!Tally is on Rinkeby testnet \u2014 the perfect playground for you to try it out as a customer or service provider.Step 1A prerequisite for using Tally is a MetaMask wallet. On the Rinkeby test network, you need tokens in your active MetaMask wallet to stake and to pay for prepaid cards. So, please set up your MetaMask wallet and get yourself some ETH on Rinkeby to pay for gas. Here is a guide to help you get started.Step 2You need to obtain some Rinkeby tokens that Tally accepts. There are different ways to do this:Discord #faucet channel: In the Cardstack Discord server, you can request testing tokens from the #faucet channel. We have three different Rinkeby tokens for you to try out: CARD, DAI, and USDT. If you want to try Tally with any of these tokens, just post a message in our #faucet channel with your Rinkeby wallet address and the tokens that you\u2019d like to test with, and we will airdrop you some testing tokens.Self-serve with 0x token contracts: We accept two different 0x-owned Rinkeby tokens in Tally: WETH and REP. 0x has created a dApp that allows you to mint these tokens yourself, so we do not offer them in our #faucet channel. Our system uses real-world crypto token rates to exchange WETH and REP for CARD tokens when depositing them in a prepaid card. NOTE: The Rinkeby ecosystem reflects the same CARD token circulation that we have on mainnet. Therefore, in order to give everyone a chance to try out the Tally system on Rinkeby, we respectfully request that you do not mint more than 2,000 CARD tokens per person.Step 3The Tally UI consists of two main sections. One is meant for end users / customers, allowing them to buy and manage their prepaid cards. The other one is meant for service providers, who can register, manage their stake, and bill customers for using services. Feel free to play around with Tally as both a customer and a service provider, to figure out how this billing system works! We would love to hear your feedback in our Discord channel.If you have any questions, check out our FAQ section.Play with Tally as a customer\u2026In this demo, our product manager Dmitry Naidionov demonstrates how to buy a prepaid card and pay for services in the Cardstack Ecosystem.Follow this link to our Tally home page and click \u201cBuy a prepaid card\u201d.Tally supports both ERC-20 and ERC-777 tokens. To create a prepaid card, you select the token and the amount you want to deposit; then, you proceed with the purchase. For ERC-20 tokens, this is a three-step approval process: First, you need to reset the current authorization (if one exists). Second, you authorize the withdrawal of that amount from your account. Third, you deposit the funds. With ERC-777 tokens, this is a much quicker process that only requires one confirmation click. (ERC-777 are not broadly supported tokens on the Ethereum mainnet, but we want to future-proof our smart contracts; so, support is already included in this testnet version.)Now, you have bought a prepaid card, which you can use to pay for services \u2014 once we have launched on mainnet. Internally, service providers will bill you in SSC (which is our internal billing unit; 1 SSC = USD 0.01), but that is nothing you need to worry about; when a bill is created, the SSC amount they charge you is automatically converted to the cryptocurrency that you used to pay for your prepaid card, based on the current cryptocurrency-USD exchange rate from Cryptocompare (SSC is pegged to USD). This means that the amount you are billed for will simply be deducted from the cryptocurrency balance on your prepaid card. However, for your convenience, we display the approximate available balance on your prepaid card in USD. Please note: Because that balance is calculated based on each day\u2019s cryptocurrency-USD exchange rate, your available USD balance may fluctuate even if you don\u2019t use your prepaid card. These fluctuations are merely a reflection of exchange rate changes; the actual amount you have available to spend in cryptocurrency (the original tokens that you used to pay for your prepaid card) remains the same as long as you don\u2019t use your card. For example, if you purchased your prepaid card with ETH, your USD balance will change based on the ETH-USD exchange rate. But if you purchased your prepaid card with DAI, your USD balance will appear to be stable.The cryptocurrency you have deposited by buying a prepaid card is sent to the reserve pool. This pool ensures that the amount of tokens customers pay for prepaid cards (which can be various cryptocurrencies) is backed by CARD tokens. Once your tokens are in the reserve pool, the equivalent amount of CARD tokens (determined by the current exchange rate) is taken out of it and transferred to the reward pool. When the CARD balance of the reserve pool is sufficiently depleted, Cardstack will withdraw the non-CARD tokens the reserve pool has accumulated and use them to buy more CARD tokens, which will then be deposited back into the reserve pool, to ensure the continuity of this reserve.Now that you own a prepaid card, you can look at the details regarding your service providers. Note: Since your card was only just created, it has no actual usage and zero active service providers at this point. So, go ahead and subscribe to one! You have to subscribe to service providers in order to use their services and enable them to bill you.If you ever want to stop someone from billing you, you can remove that particular service provider from your prepaid card. Please note that billing happens per provider per card. So, if you have subscribed to a provider with your first prepaid card, but want to pay for his services with a second prepaid card, you have to subscribe to that provider again with your second prepaid card. Likewise, if you have multiple prepaid cards active with the same provider, removing the provider from one card does not remove that provider from your other cards.Play with Tally as a service provider\u2026In this demo, our product manager Dmitry Naidionov demonstrates how to register as a service provider and charge customers for using services.Follow this link to our Tally home page and click \u201cRegister as a service provider\u201d.You can only create one provider per MetaMask wallet address. In order to register as a service provider, you need to select your stake (note: as a provider, you must deposit your stake using CARD tokens) and go through a three-step, on-chain approval process. Your stake goes directly into the reward pool and serves as a kind of insurance against bad actors (meaning: providers who violate the terms may get their stake slashed).Once a customer has subscribed to you, you can bill that customer for using your services. Simply select the prepaid card that will be billed from your list of active subscribers. Except for the set-up fee (which customers pay to subscribe to a new service provider), the billed usage is recorded entirely off-chain, and the remaining balance is computed by subtracting the off-chain usage totals and the set-up fee from the on-chain stake. Eventually, we will offer a billing API that your services need to integrate with, in order to bill customers for usage programmatically, without going through the Tally Web app. In the testing phase, you can create manual billing items by going to your service provider card and clicking the \u201cRegister Usage\u201d button.We are still working on the functionality that will allow you to withdraw funds from the reward pool as a service provider. Our plan is to enable you to withdraw your earnings and convert them to the token of your choice in one step, thus ensuring a seamless withdrawal process.What\u2019s next for Tally?Integration with decentralized exchanges. We want to enable customers to deposit and withdraw their preferred tokens. To that end, we aim to establish key trading pairs with the CARD token \u2014 which is the native token of the CARD Protocol \u2014 and stablecoins that reflect fiat values on-chain. We also plan to accept alternative payment methods in the future, so people can use other crypto assets via protocols like Uniswap.Incentivize customers and providers to use the CARD Protocol. When we launch Tally on mainnet, we will award bonus tokens to buyers and sellers based on actual usage and earnings. This will be part of Batch D of our token distribution plan.Integration with service providers\u2019 applications. We want to make sure service providers can easily list their applications in the Card Catalog. Additionally, we will release the documentation, so they can call Tally APIs programmatically to report usage data.Create user-friendly tools. Tally is an administrative tool similar to a blockchain explorer that shows a history of all on-chain transactions. We will roll out different variants of hosted (yet non-custodial) wallets, to ensure that the onboarding experience for casual customers, who want to activate a software subscription with a credit card, is no different than their experience on the centralized Web.Tally is the platform technology that handles the back-office administrative work of revenue distribution and customer acceptance. Allowing every day-to-day software user to pay for services via cryptocurrency, without actually having to own any cryptocurrency, is one of the most promising ways to bring cryptocurrency and its flexibility to the mainstream.Learn MoreFrequently asked questions about TallyThe CARD Protocol explainedCardstack.comStar Cardstack on GitHub and join our Discord channel or our Telegram group and announcement channel to get all our latest updates.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Ethereum", "Rinkeby Test Network", "Token", "Web3"]}, {"title": "The Brand-New, Official Cardstack Discord Channel", "post_link": "https://medium.com/cardstack/the-brand-new-official-cardstack-discord-channel-4a2ffd925cee?source=search_post", "author_name": "Cardstack Team", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@cardstack", "publish_date": "2019-07-08", "last_modified_date": "2019-08-20", "readtime": "3.54", "claps": 86, "voters": 3, "content": "The Brand-New, Official Cardstack Discord ChannelWhere we unify the communication between our team and our communityCardstack TeamFollowJul 8 \u00b7 4 min readJoin our official Discord channel: Cardstack Community (find instructions below)We created our Telegram group in January 2018 and within weeks, new members poured in by the thousands. In order for the Cardstack Project to grow further and evolve into a thriving ecosystem that can bring about the open-source era we all desire, we need to make sure that our communication strategy addresses everyone who wishes to contribute, especially the developer community. To that end, we have been beta-testing a new platform in the last few months: Discord.We have learned two important lessons from this successful beta-test:We need to avoid internal communication fragmentation on different platforms.We need to move from an invitation-only to a please-come-in community.Although Discord proved to be very useful, our communication became more fragmented through the addition of a new platform, as our developers communicated on Discord, while the rest of the team focused on Slack. Moreover, our community members couldn\u2019t join our Discord channel without a personal invitation.Therefore, inspired by the Ember community\u2019s approach and their Slack-to-Discord migration, our plan is to consolidate our communication and have everyone who is a part of Cardstack \u2014 both our team and our community \u2014 in one place, in one channel. With that in mind, we are closing our Slack accounts (thus saving on licensing fees that Slack no longer needs anyway) as well as retiring our current Discord server. We are moving all our internal and external discourse to a new Discord server titled \u201cCardstack Community\u201d \u2014 moving from personal-invite-only to public access!This will ease communication between everyone, allowing us to be more available to and connect more deeply with our community members.

Our mission is to organize the world\u2019s information and to make it freely accessible.Data in the 21st century is like oil in the 20th century \u2014 an immensely valuable asset that is critical to the economy. Unfortunately most data is privately held and expensive to access. These data silos limit competition and stifle creativity. We believe that structured data about the world needs to be freely available for new applications and services to emerge.Why do we need DIRT?In many domains, information sources are biased or dishonest. For example, companies pay for positive product reviews. In unregulated markets, financial data may be purposely misrepresented. While crowd-based curation removes the dependency on a single source, this approach struggles to maintain quality because there are no incentives for moderation.DIRT is a new approach to crowdsourcingWith DIRT, we propose a new way to crowdsource trusted information at scale. DIRT is a protocol to curate information using token staking to incentivize honesty.Similar to Wikipedia, DIRT allows anyone to contribute information. DIRT maintains accuracy because every contributor needs to deposit tokens to write data. If the data is correct, it is freely shared. If the data is incorrect, anyone can challenge the data and earn tokens for identifying these inaccurate facts. Our protocol and platform makes it economically irrational for misinformation to persist in a data set.DIRT is not a Token Curated Registry (TCR). DIRT is a protocol to build TCRs.What\u2019s nextWe are working with partners to build the first applications for DIRT. If you are interested in being on our early partners and using DIRT, please reach out at hello@dirtprotocol.com. We will release our whitepaper in the coming weeks.Join their mailing list to stay up to date.If you want to join their mission to make data freely available, please apply to work with the DIRT team.Thanks for reading.

I like the idea. But how can I use it? What is the product? What is the thing I can get my hands on? How can I experience Cardstack?\u201dLet\u2019s start with this question: Who is in the ecosystem \u2014 who participates in the \u201cCardstack\u201d way of doing things?End usersThey choose Cardstack because the user-friendly open-source software is cheaper and better than what they know today. They see this as a way to find the tools they need. What they are looking for is the best selection, the best price, and the best service. That is why we create a Card Catalog, to which open-source contributors can add all kinds of cards, from which end users can choose. This pool of software code provides a great selection of cards to use for payment, content, messaging, and much more. Instead of asking users to download 15 different apps and keep track of 40 different subscriptions, all of which (including individual features) they have to pay for separately, we offer them everything they need in one catalog \u2014 one that contains all cards and features for one flat rate, which makes this approach much better priced than the alternatives. The monthly subscription fee paid by the end user simply covers the rewards for the developers, who create the code, and the providers, who support the network by offering their services to the end users. Yet, while the catalog is well priced for each individual user, these subscriptions essentially fund the ecosystem, by rewarding everybody who contributes.DevelopersThey want something that helps them to make money, but that is also easy to build. Currently, when developers try to build and sell an application, they have to pay for a server themselves, hoping that users will eventually subscribe and cover the cost. In the Cardstack Ecosystem, there will be low or no operating costs, as we shift the cost to the users. And the developer won\u2019t have to worry about hosting either, which is provided by hosting service providers. More importantly, we offer developers a unified SDK, consisting of both the front-end and the back-end, allowing them to create, deploy, and sell their cards \u2014 their mini-applications \u2014 all within one system. There\u2019s only one set of software, one Cardstack SDK in JavaScript to learn to use.ProvidersThey help users host the software that is built by developers, similarly to hosting WordPress for a user. And that\u2019s a sticky arrangement. Once you\u2019re running your website or application with a certain provider, you\u2019re likely to stick with that provider over time. The recurring revenue coming in through the users will create incentives for service providers who know how to operate in the cloud, including sustainable margins. Service providers want to know that it\u2019s not a race to the bottom, so they will be able to run a successful business. On the other hand, users always have the choice to switch providers, if they are not content with the service provider hosting their blog, for instance \u2014 this is possible due to our open-source approach and the fact that our data is portable. So, we build one stack to manage and deploy on any containerized cloud. We use Docker, Kubernetes, and other cloud deployment software technologies, to ensure that anyone can operate a Cardstack-based service. People can take that open-source code (not only the framework, but also the UI code) for the features of the card and deploy it in any type of commodity cloud service. Yet, the cloud provider does not get the margins. The people who build on top of a cloud provider and offer support to the users \u2014 the Cardstack service providers \u2014 receive the margins. Eventually, this turns into a competitive market.BusinessesBusinesses are groups of users who want dependability. They want the software they work with to be properly maintained. People in the open-source community are willing to pay more for an additional level of dependency, in case something goes wrong with a plugin or a certain database driver needs to be updated. They will pay for the support provided by developers and service providers who know what it means to build on Cardstack. Furthermore, our open-source technologies allow the stack Cardstack depends on \u2014 our database, our servers, or even the blockchain software \u2014 to be cost-effective. There is no license fee underneath, no cost going beyond the package value that we can provide to the end user. Businesses essentially want white-label software with open-source code as a core, and that is what we offer them.How are the ecosystem participants connected?Cardstack sits in the middle of this four-sided market between users, providers, developers, and businesses, offering each of them their respective set of experiences, while the token mechanism allows them to participate in the economic value of this network.Developers provide users with a catalog of software code that takes the form of cards. It\u2019s like an app store, where developers publish their apps, which users then download and use.Developers and providers have an economic relationship. The developers build software, which is then hosted by service providers, who get paid for their services by the subscribed users who end up using the software. The subscription revenue, which the providers receive from the users, is collected in a reward pool \u2014 part of which is then distributed to the developers. After all, the developers are the ones who build the software the users are using in the first place, plus the ones who maintain and improve that software continuously. They are the ones whose code makes the users willing to pay. Thus, they earn a fair share of the reward, which is calculated based on actual usage analysis. This means: The reward goes from the user through the provider to the developer, so that both the provider and the developer get compensated fairly for their contribution to the network.Businesses and providers are connected through the Tally Protocol, which calculates how much of the revenue each of them should get, based on actual usage data. How many gigabytes of storage, how many thousands of API calls \u2014 that\u2019s all information that exists on-chain, off-chain, or in the cloud. Tally looks at the shared accounting between the businesses and the providers and determines how the network should distribute the money.Businesses and users collaborate using Card Flow. Cards are objects that encapsulate data and functionality, but when they move between organizations \u2014 like an invoice moving in, a payment going out \u2014 that\u2019s where business gets done. Between businesses and users, it\u2019s all about the exchange of cards. This workflow system is the basic aspect of their relationship, combining a conversational UI with logistics and action-chaining.The Card SDKThe Card SDK (software development kit) is a composable UI system, allowing developers to easily build card templates, which end users then use to make their own cards. The Card SDK is deployed to the Cardstack Hub, which is the server. But that server is unique: In most systems, the developers run the server, so the users\u2019 files are stored in the developer\u2019s data center, being controlled by the developer. In our situation, developers deploy their cards to the hub, which is run by service providers of their choice. This way, all users have their own hub, their own server, their own little personal cloud, where they have all their code \u2014 whether it\u2019s for note-taking or music-making or image-editing. It is run by a service provider, but it belongs to them.The Card CatalogUsing the Card SDK, developers create cards that they add to the Card Catalog. There are different types of cards:A Content Card could be a blog post or an image you can edit. A Data Card could be a form to do a survey. An Asset Card is similar to a Data Card, but may track conversion rates through an external database, providing the information you need for your cryptocurrency exchange. For instance, an Asset Card tells you the USD value for a certain Bitcoin or Ethereum transaction. But content, data, and assets are much more than just screenshots \u2014 they are actually live and real apps.An Action Card is more like a strategy. To name a few examples of what Action Cards can do: They allow users to send data, extract funds, convert their assets into other assets via decentralized exchanges, put their data into CRM (customer relationship management) software, publish content to the Web, get it distributed all around the world, and much more.The user experienceContent, data, asset, action \u2014 all these cards go into the Card Catalog. Once they are in the catalog, they can be experienced by users in different ways.A developer who believes in the Card UI and wants to build an entire stand-alone website, which is indistinguishable from what you see today, can compose the cards into an experience that takes up the full screen. Other developers may prefer to embed the card within their websites or workflows, just like a YouTube video. Alternatively, they could say, \u201cI have enough capability within this website. I want to show a list of cards to pick, or a list of addresses to choose from when sending cryptocurrency!\u201d An overlay allows the user to pick and choose between several cards. So, whether it\u2019s standalone or embedded or in an overlay, they\u2019re all just different ways of packaging these cards in the Catalog for the user to see.Identity representationCard-based identity representations make users\u2019 lives easier, allowing them to say, \u201cYou know who I am.\u201d Cards can represent a credential, a login, a username and password. In that sense, they are almost like ID cards, which users can use to bypass signups. Once they have a Credential Card from one site, they can go to another website or card-based experience without having to log in again.A Subscription Card works similarly. If you subscribe to a hosting service, you can create content without worrying about limits of the free version. Plus, we offer cross-honoring, where the subscription is honored on various websites; as long as they all accept Cardstack\u2019s subscription, the subscribed users get a pass through all of them. It\u2019s almost like a class pass, where you can take yoga classes from anywhere in your town once you buy a subscription.We cross-honor this subscription because it\u2019s essentially a membership. It\u2019s deeper than a payment. You\u2019re joining a community. This could be a corporate membership, which allows you to access certain features that your company has paid for \u2014 with your Membership Card. It could also be a personal membership, offering you a nice little pool of new features if you go to the platinum tier.It could also be a simple Contact Card containing personal information, which users can create and reuse for all kinds of different purposes and workflows.Payment methodsPeople like Amazon because they have their credit card stored there; they like Starbucks because they can reload their balance whenever they need it. The Cardstack experience will offer these various payment methods too, so that users can choose how to pay. They can ask service providers to deduct against their balance, using a Reward Card, a Prepaid Card, or a Credit Card.A major part of the CARD Protocol \u2014 the economic model that makes this ecosystem sustainable \u2014 is about using these identity and payment cards as the basic connection between different instances or service providers, allowing them to share and bill mutual customers. This is all part of the front-end, the Card UI, which contains templates, schema definitions, and data source mapping. But the idea is that all these cards, these mini-apps, get aggregated into a kind of super app \u2014 whether it\u2019s stand-alone, embedded, or overlay.The Cardstack HubThe Cardstack Hub is a decentralized application server that powers the entire system, sitting between the cards and the rest of the world. The data sources it connects to could be devices, clouds, or blockchains (because the hub has plugins for Ethereum and supports integration with different smart contracts, it can treat the blockchain as if it were just another data source).The cards that are built using the Card SDK can talk to any hub, enabling the hub to get the data it needs, to query, or to transfer content easily. If you want to send a card to another person, the inbox of that person is just another space or queue within that person\u2019s hub. Our focus is to make the experience simple for the end user.The Cardstack Hub is quite mature. It has been running on multiple apps and is running continuously in the cloud. This ensures that, if you make a transaction on the blockchain, it is automatically reflected in all cards that use the hub as a data source.The CARD ProtocolTo bring the Card SDK and the Cardstack Hub together in a decentralized way, we need the CARD Protocol.If you only have one service and one SDK (for example, Instagram with an Instagram SDK), developers can only deploy their software to one company. But in our open-network approach, inspired by blockchain and implemented using open-source technology, we can essentially build a multi-currency payment and billing network.The CARD Protocol allows a user to choose any service provider who runs a hub and say, \u201cI pick you to help me store my image files, or manage my wallet, or count my sales, or process my credit card payments or cryptocurrency transactions.\u201d Users are not limited to one provider or one hub. They can have different hubs and different service providers serving different cards, because one provider may be good at dealing with data, while another one may be better at dealing with a content management system. But it\u2019s all built using the same Card SDK, thus offers one cohesive experience. And the Cardstack Hub is the server where it all comes together.Users are customers who deposit money to pay the service providers. Their funds get accumulated in a reward pool. Based on the rendered service and billable usage, the service providers receive a portion of that reward pool, which they can withdraw. The hub reports the relevant data to the protocol.A multi-currency payment network requires a few more aspects, as we want to shift the risk between the buyer and the seller; it should be as if they were exchanging money at the time the service was performed. Therefore, the market rates factor into the value of the currency the users choose as payment. The protocol has to figure out how much the user\u2019s token or USD was worth at particular times. This is done through a market rate oracle \u2014 a service that keeps track of spending, due dates, currencies, exchange rates, etc. That information is captured at the time of purchase. If you pay in USD, the oracle determines how much USD was worth at that moment. And based on how much is left in this particular pool, you get the spendable balance. Let\u2019s say you put in a British Pound; suddenly, Brexit happens and the British Pound loses half its value. In that case, your spendable balance would be halved as well. This means: As long as a user hasn\u2019t paid for a rendered service, the user (not the service provider) will take the risk of the currency exchange. However, if the user has already paid for the service (before the value of the currency was cut in half), then the service provider would be the one taking the risk.The CARD Protocol coordinates between these six aspects \u2014 deposits, market rates, billable usage, withdrawals, purchases, and spendable balance \u2014 to ensure that this is a fair network. When it comes to payments, you get what your underlying asset is worth; so customers can be billed in a fair and accurate way.Tally keeps track of the market rates and determines the reward, which is an on-chain smart contract that locks the tokens and the equivalent tokens (if you pay in USD, we lock an equivalent amount of the stablecoin pegged to USD, so we can actually measure on-chain, with some off-chain conversion data, exactly what it\u2019s worth).To bill a user, we need to know how much of the offered service the user has actually used. Being deployed to a cloud, the hub reports this usage data. If there is a monthly subscription, it\u2019s easy; you can just bill the users monthly, as long as they don\u2019t cancel the subscription. But first, there needs to be some money that has been deposited; and that\u2019s where the cryptocurrency wallet comes in. This wallet can come from the end user or from a service provider who manages the wallet for the user, depositing the user\u2019s money into the stake pool on his behalf. This stake backs the value of the billing entry. If there are USD 100,000 worth of stake in this smart contract, you can feel confident that, if you bill the user up to USD 100,000, there\u2019s enough money there you can withdraw. Though the billing will most likely happen on a side chain, it is always redeemable on-chain.That billing ultimately funds the rewards for the service providers and the developers (which is calculated by Tally, running on the Cardstack Hub). It also concerns the service providers and businesses who want to have a say in how this network operates. For instance, this could be about the rate that open-source developers get for their work. If the portion of the developer\u2019s revenue is too high, the service providers will not be interested in providing services, because they\u2019re not making sustainable margins; but if it\u2019s too low, the developers will not be interested in building the tools. The mechanism of the stake pool thus governs the network, to determine the values of these important percentages, so as to balance the interests of all four parties.This is an overview of the tools we offer to ecosystem participants. Users can use Card Space to organize cards; they can use Card Flow to communicate and join networks. Businesses can provide their own price lists and use the Tally mechanism to bill for their services. These don\u2019t have to be low-level services like the ones that providers bill for, but could be validation services, underwriting services, or quality assurance services.This is the basic ecosystem that not only connects wallets, clouds, and chains, but also makes sure that this is part of the Web \u2014 that you can go to a domain and different card spaces, which are websites on Web 3.0. Once you join such a website, that on-ramp is part of the greater network.To sum up: Cardstack is at the core of this four-sided market between users, developers, providers, and businesses. We want to provide everything the users need at a good price, with good services, and a good selection. We want our network to give developers the opportunity to reach the largest audience on the Web. We want to enable providers to compete on price, services, and geography. We want to allow businesses to white-label our software, to build blockchain-based or cloud-based networks that are collaborative, using Cardstack as the basic runtime to form relationships and reach users in new ways. Finally, the intersections between the users, the developers, the providers, and the businesses are important pieces as we create this full ecosystem, where all the participants and the value network are connected in a seamless way.What\u2019s next?1. We are preparing for the beta launch of Card Folio, the alpha-version of which we open-sourced in January. It runs on the Cardstack Hub as the back-end. We have improved our integration with the Ethereum network, so you will be able to plug in your MetaMask and use Card Folio\u2019s query engine. Once we have plugins to support other types of protocol, we will be able to make that your asset orientation \u2014 your wallet, your portfolio. That is a very important aspect of introducing people to not only blockchain, but also decentralized finance. This is going to be our first consumer-facing product.2. Tally and the CARD Protocol are under active development, with Tally currently running on Rinkeby testnet. The CARD Token is the native token, to be used to redeem services. But we will also support other currencies; you can stake other tokens, like DAI or ETH, as a deposit to use Cardstack services, and the conversion will be done inside the smart contract.3. Jen Weber, our developer who focuses on the Cardstack Framework, provides ongoing updates on the developer experience of the Card SDK. We are in the process of compiling comprehensive documentation, which will explain how developers can build cards using our SDK. Of course, it\u2019s easy to build a powerful framework that is hard to use. The real magic is building a powerful framework that brings back-end and front-end concepts and packages together, but is so easy to use that, once you define a schema and some templates, suddenly you have a card that can get automatically deployed. Developers want to be successful immediately. That\u2019s why we want to enable them to push their code into the catalog with just one command line. Our framework does all the hard work, so they can focus on the features of their cards.At Cardstack, we believe that the Web can become a real software ecosystem \u2014 not just a ton of individual websites fighting for ad dollars or competing for pop-ups. There is an opportunity for us to reboot the Web, using cryptocurrency and blockchain as a way to make it a more decentralized network. It\u2019s about digging deep and understanding what kind of open-source software that was developed in the last generation we can bundle together, to provide an experience that is as attractive as an Android or iOS ecosystem. With the right abstraction, the right bundle, the right tools, and the right ecosystem participants \u2014 acting in both their self-interest and the interest of the network \u2014 we\u2019re going to get there, with Cardstack being a catalyst for the movement of Web 3.0!Learn MoreThe CARD Protocol Explained: Lightly edited transcript of Chris Tse\u2019s tech talkTally Launches on Testnet: Try Cardstack\u2019s metering and billing network for decentralized SaaSCard Makers: Who Are They? \u2014 Cardstack Tech TalkCardstack.comStar Cardstack on GitHub and join our Discord channel or our Telegram group and announcement channel to get all our latest updates.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Web3", "Software Development", "Decentralization", "Information Technology"]}, {"title": "Akropolis Launches Proof-of-Concept Chain Using Substrate", "post_link": "https://medium.com/polkadot-network/akropolis-launches-proof-of-concept-chain-using-substrate-eb7a551549a6?source=search_post", "author_name": "Polkadot", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@polkadotnetwork", "publish_date": "2019-07-06", "last_modified_date": "2019-09-17", "readtime": "1.52", "claps": 10, "voters": 3, "content": "Akropolis Launches Proof-of-Concept Chain Using SubstratePolkadotFollowJul 6 \u00b7 2 min readThe Akropolis team launched a Substrate-based chain earlier this year for their DeFi protocol. Akropolis intends to participate in a parachain slot auction after the Polkadot main net launch. As a parachain, they would provide financial services and contracts to other applications in the Polkadot system.Once launched, the Akropolis chain will enable peer-to-peer, user-owned financial organizations to exchange value regardless of geography and provide core financial services without dependending on banks, governments, or financial institutions (e.g. savings accounts, pooled financial/investment instruments, pooled insurance contracts, alternative pensions solutions, etc.). The Akropolis team has already identified a target user base and hopes that their product will address these needs.Akropolis recently partnered with ChainX to do joint research on Substrate, on-chain governance, and interoperability between the two chains. Akropolis is also researching applications of zk-SNARKS and LayerX to ensure the privacy of financial transactions within the parachain.Early contributors to Polkadot, the Akropolis team also runs a validator on Polkadot\u2019s Alexander testnet (PoC-4).Akropolis also intends to build PolkaHub, infrastructure intended to enable wider developer adoption for Polkadot. Polkahub will significantly lower the barriers to entry to the Polkadot Network by introducing Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) for Substrate nodes, inspired by Heroku, aiming to create a one-click service for deploying and running Substrate-based chains. The proposed system enables automatic updates and resource management for running nodes, additionally providing templates for launching parachains. Creating this PaaS solution will allow developers to focus fully on the development of their own parachains or applications, rather than setting up and maintaining infrastructure.Akropolis believes that programmable money and programmable financial instruments are the future and that domain-specific chains will dominate the ecosystem. As Akropolis CEO Ana Andrianova stated, \u201cAkropolis has been closely following the progress of the Polkadot project. We share the values of technological agnosticism, interoperability, and cross-chain collaboration. Akropolis aims to become a key building block supporting the new, user-centric, crisis-resilient financial ecosystem.\u201dOriginally published at https://polkadot.network on July 6, 2019.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Substrate", "Akropolis", "Web3 Foundation", "Poc"]}, {"title": "Interact with Smart Contracts using the Command Line", "post_link": "https://medium.com/quiknode/interacting-with-smart-contracts-using-the-command-line-3f6d299f7108?source=search_post", "author_name": "Gaurav Agrawal", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@gaurav.agrawal", "publish_date": "2019-05-09", "last_modified_date": "2019-05-09", "readtime": "3.88", "claps": 53, "voters": 4, "content": "Photo by Shahadat Shemul on UnsplashInteract with Smart Contracts using the Command LineUsing sbt-ethereum to interact with Ethereum Smart ContractsGaurav AgrawalFollowMay 9 \u00b7 4 min readIn the last article, we learned how to create and manage wallets and addresses using sbt-ethereum, so we strongly recommend reading that article first.

Once you get the testnet Ether, you can check your balance using:ethAddressBalance ropstenHere, ropsten is an alias we gave to our wallet address.Interacting with the Smart ContractsLet\u2019s interact with a Smart Contract now. I have deployed a Smart Contract on the Ropsten network so we can play with it. Here is the deployed Contract at address 0xBaC18C78D7BEAEbc99EBc2C3392Befe9b3A6A347To interact with the Smart Contract, we need to first load it on sbt. Let\u2019s see how we\u2019ll do that:Create an alias for contract address:ethAddressAliasSet fortune 0xBaC18C78D7BEAEbc99EBc2C3392Befe9b3A6A347Just double check if it is set correctly usingethAddressAliasList .Next, we need to upload the ABI of the fortune contract, so we can run contracts functions using the command line. There are two ways to load an ABI on sbt :ManuallyUsing Etherscan APIYes, you can integrate Etherscan with sbt! But we do this manually in this tutorial. To get the ABI, follow these steps:Go to http://ropsten.etherscan.io/ (our contract is on Ropsten network)Plug the address of the contract \u2014 0xBaC18C78D7BEAEbc99EBc2C3392Befe9b3A6A347 \u2014 into the search field in the upper right and hit \u201cGo\u201d. (Etherscan doesn\u2019t know anything about our sbt-ethereum alias fortune, so we can\u2019t use that!)On the page that comes up, look for a tab that says \u201cCode\u201d with a small green checkmark. Click on that.Scroll down until you see the \u201cContract ABI\u201d section.Copy the ABI using the copy button at the top right corner of the Contract ABI box.Next, upload this ABI on sbt using below command:ethContractAbiDefaultImport fortuneHere fortune is an alias for our contract address, remember?Before calling Smart Contract functions, we will override our default sender address, so all the transactions go through that address.ethAddressSenderOverride ropstenHere ropsten is alias name for our wallet address.Before moving forward, make a back up here. Always make backups! Otherwise, your work may get lost.ethShoeboxBackupCalling Smart Contract FunctionsNow we\u2019re all set!

The product designers I admire most got their hands dirty with early Web 2.0. They ushered in a new era of apps, advertising, social, and big data. They started companies that would become modern-day juggernauts: Twitter, Instagram, Airbnb, Squarespace, Vimeo and many more.Web 2.0 was the ultimate expression of right place, right time, right people. The right distribution ecosystems were built, like iOS and Android. The right developer tools were rapidly evolving, making experimentation fast and cheap. Startup funding was aggressive and plentiful. Billions of new consumers got their first smartphone. It was a golden era for products: user experience became very, very smooth. User attention was artfully captured, retained, and monetized.But on Web 2.0, I can\u2019t help but feel too late. You\u2019re too late, too. The juggernauts have network lock-in. They make huge profits selling your social life to advertisers, then reinvesting their profits into armies of new product designers, who then invent better ways to mine your attention. If you want to disrupt this status quo, good luck. On Web 2.0, we are all too late \u2014 the successful founders have built their moats, and we are left to fight over the scraps.Remember all that weird decentralized app stuff from 2017? It was overhyped. All the startups died, and then they called it the \u201cCrypto Winter\u201d. Part of the hype was about two innovations:Money that can be programmed vs. government-issued, non programmable money.Online identities that protect users\u2019 digital rights vs. identities that allow continuous violation of your privacy so the juggernauts can show you ads.Which online identity would you rather use? Which money do you think internet businesses would prefer to use? It could take two years or 20 years, but one way or another, these technologies will take over everything. This is the Web 3.0 \u2014 the most important technology shift of our lifetimes. And the current product design sucks. If you are a product designer, and you understand this, your timing is profoundly perfect.Today on Web 3.0, most of the apps are various forms of online casino \u2014 sketchy, risky, and radioactive to normal people. There have been huge investments in the underlying technology and in business models, but not in the product design. The first decentralized app to reach one million active users probably already exists; it\u2019s just too ugly to recognize today.I\u2019ve spent the last two years building Web 3.0 app infrastructure. Unlike the casinos, Blockstack is focused on enabling fundamental digital rights for all internet users. We help founders compete with the juggernauts. We also have an App Mining program which pays app builders to launch Blockstack apps that solve real problems and also delight users. We are proud of these apps, but also recognize we are in a product design vacuum.You could be one of the first product designers to get their hands dirty with Web 3.0. The designers who showed us all how decentralized products should work. Gather your developer friends, and you can build a Blockstack app in a weekend. After a few days of iteration, you can qualify for App Mining and start earning monthly payments.The top Blockstack App Mining apps in Aug 2019App Mining is competitive, but even a modest dose of user thinking should catapult you to the top of the rankings. Alternatively, you can offer to join an existing app team as a designer or cofounder. I started a thread on the Blockstack forum to help connect app builders with product designers. Jump in, say hi, and meet dozens of developers who are building apps and need design help.On Web 3.0, your timing is perfect.

In this first part, we will introduce you to Aragon and what it does. We will talk about its architecture and different parts of its stack. In the next article, we will create a really simple DAO using Aragon!What is a DAO?A DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) is a Smart Contract-controlled organizational system. Currently, every organization has some sort of hierarchy, with typical top-down decision making. In the future, we can have democratic organizations where rules are created and changes are based on voting. Every function (such as payroll and fund management) can be controlled by Smart Contracts. These types of organizations will be called DAOs: where no single authority will be in control and organizational decisions are powered by Smart Contracts. These types of organizations will be unstoppable.Organizations that can be spun up instantly, that can\u2019t be shut down by governments, that are resistant to internet censorship, and that allows small groups of people to collaborate effectively.What is Aragon?Aragon fulfills this dream and provides tools to build a DAO on top of Ethereum (a Smart Contract blockchain). Aragon provides a full end-to-end framework to build DAOs. Let's understand Aragon\u2019s architecture and different parts of its framework.Before understanding how Aragon architecture works together, let\u2019s understand its different parts.aragonCLI: a tool for creating, testing and publishing Aragon applications through the command line.aragonOS: manages different parts of the Aragon stack; it\u2019s a Smart Contract framework that enables flexible and upgradeable governance mechanisms by creating and assigning permissions to multiple entities. It mainly provides 3 functionalities:UpgradabilityPermission ControlForwardingaragonPM: a decentralized package manager build on top of aragonOS that handles upgradeability of Smart Contracts and arbitrary data blobs, such as web apps. aragonPM allows multiple aragonPM registries with different governance models for package creation and publishing new versions. There is an official Aragon curated instance, aragonpm.eth, curated by Aragon and an open registry (open.aragonpm.eth) for the community.aragonPM Repository: a Smart Contract deployed inside aragonPM that keeps track of the versions for a package.aragonPM architectureThe aragonPM registry includes a number of installed apps, including an APMRegistry app and an ENSSubdomainRegistrar app, alongside many Repo instances. Each new created Repo is to be assigned its own subdomain. This gives users the ability to find repos with human-readable names, such as voting.aragonpm.eth.aragonAPI: a standard set of APIs and specifications used to interact with aragonOS-powered contracts by handling transaction pathing, upgradeability, and contract state. An implementation is available in JavaScript currently.aragonUI: a Aragon-native toolkit of UI components for decentralized apps (dApps). It is a collection of UI components built by Aragon for the community. Using aragonUI is not mandatory to build a DAO.Aragon Apps: apps which use aragonOS, aragonAPI, and integrate inside the Aragon client.Aragon Client: a full dApp which can create and manage decentralized organizations by running Aragon apps inside of it.DAO Template: Smart Contracts which can be used as templates for creating pre-configured DAOs in just one transaction.Access Control List (ACL): a mapping of who has permission to execute an action in an Aragon app and who can re-grant or revoke that permission.Aragon architectureUnderstanding Aragon ArchitectureIn simple terms, Aragon contains multiple components to build a DAO. Aragon is an end-to-end solution, so on front-end side it has aragonUI and aragonClient (which interacts with aragonOS using aragonAPIs). Aragon clients also integrate with aragonApps (voting, payroll).aragonOS has 4 main components:KernelACLaragonAppsForwarder and EVMScriptsThese components are responsible for contract upgradeability, permission management, and providing new functionality. In the above diagram, you can see how an action gets performed by an ANT (Aragon Network Token) holder on Aragon\u2019s own DAO.Here, the token holder is trying to vote using the Voting app (provided by the Aragon DAO). First, it gets the address of the configured version of the Voting app using Aragon kernel, then it checks if the action can be performed using ACL (through the kernel).Wrapping UpWe will stop here today, however you can read more about Aragon\u2019s components and architecture here.Further Reading Material:Aragon Developer PortalAragon BlogIn the next article, we will learn how to create a simple DAO using Aragon \u2014 don\u2019t miss it and subscribe below!About QuikNodeQuikNode.io is building infrastructure to support the future of Web3.

Today, we\u2019ll look at building EVM packages using zOS. Using Zeppelin, we can create an EVM package which can be used by other developers. Your EVM package will be deployed on the Ethereum Blockchain and any developer can link your package in their Smart Contracts.What is an EVM package?An EVM package is an upgradable dependency for your Smart Contracts. In simple words: it\u2019s an upgradable deployed Smart Contact on Ethereum blockchain which anyone can use as a dependency for their project.Building an EVM PackageBuilding an EVM package is similar to building an upgradable project as we have seen in our last tutorial. If you didn\u2019t check that one, I strongly recommend you to check it out first.In this tutorial, we will build a basic upgradable Smart Contract and publish it to the local network using Ganache.As we\u2019ve already detailed how to build an upgradable Smart Contract in the last tutorial, we will skip that part and just see how to publish it on a local network:pragma solidity ^ 0.4 .24;import \"zos-lib/contracts/Initializable.sol\";contract Random is Initializable {uint256 public seed;function initialize(uint256 mySeed) initializer public {        seed = mySeed;    }function getRandom(uint256 number) public view returns(uint8) {        return uint8(uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(block.timestamp, block.difficulty, number, seed))) % 251);    }}Once we add and push the package using zos add and zos push, we are now ready to publish it to the local network using below commands:zos publish --network local** if you create a production-ready EVM package, you can push it to NPM.Using a published EVM package in your projectNow let\u2019s see how we can use an already-published EVM package in our project. We will build an ERC721 token using openzeppelin-eth EVM package.So, build a zos project (as we learned in the last tutorial) and add below ERC721 Smart Contract:pragma solidity ^0.4.24;import \"openzeppelin-eth/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721Mintable.sol\";contract SIMPLEToken{  ERC721Mintable private _token;function setToken(ERC721Mintable token) external {    require(token != address(0));    _token = token;  }}We are importingopenzeppelin-eth instead of openzeppelin-solidity . The main difference is that openzeppelin-solidity is an open-source library without deployed contracts and openzeppelin-eth is an open-source library with already deployed code, hence an EVM package.Now, let\u2019s link our project to the openzeppelin-eth package by running:zos link openzeppelin-ethThis will install openzeppelin-eth contracts and also update the zos.json file with the referenced package. So all the packages we will use, this command will insert references for those contracts in zos.json. We still need to compile these contracts.Now let\u2019s add our contract to the project:zos add SIMPLEToken** make sure that your zos session is established, and if any of the commands have failed, recreated your session using:zos session --network local --from 0x1df62f291b2e969fb0849d99d9ce41e2f137006e --expires 3600Now, let\u2019s push our changes to our local blockchain:zos push --deploy-dependenciesThe --deploy-dependencies flag is used mainly if you are using a network (no matter which) which doesn\u2019t already have the deployed EVM package you are using in your project (openzeppelin-eth in our case). So as we are using local blockchain we will use this flag, but we will only use this flag once\u2026 next time we\u2019ll already have openzeppelin-eth package deployed locally.Let\u2019s create an upgradable instance of our SIMPLEToken contract:zos create SIMPLETokenWe also need an instance of the ERC721 token from the EVM package:zos create openzeppelin-eth/StandaloneERC721 --init initialize --args SIMPLEToken,BTS,[<address>],[<address>]<address> will be the minter and pauser address of the token. For local development, you can use one of the 10 addresses which are created by ganache-cli . Remember, you can add more than 1 address as [<address>] in an array.Now we can start the Truffle console to interact with Smart Contact:npx truffle console --network localNext, let\u2019s jump to that Truffle console and connect our two deployed upgradeable contracts:truffle(local)> SIMPLEToken.at('<my-linked-contract-address>').setToken('<my-erc721-address>')Here, replace:<my-linked-contract-address> with the address you got while running zos create SIMPLEToken<my-erc721-address> with the address you got while creating StandaloneERC721 instance (check above command)Remember that the addresses of both, your contract and the token, can also be found in the zos.dev-<network_id>.json configuration file.You can find more examples and list of all available package here.ConclusionzOS provides a new paradigm for Smart Contract development. It paves the way for more complex Smart Contract architecture with the power of upgradability. In the future, you\u2019ll be able to plug & play many Smart Contracts\u2019 functionalities without worrying about each and every detail. It will create rapid growth in Smart Contract development as more developers can use these packages and Solidity libraries, and participate in building more complex systems.zOS also provides a way to build upgradable Solidity libraries, and we will discuss them in our future tutorials. Meanwhile, if you are Smart Contract developer, check out the ZeppelinOS project and you can find more details in their docs.About QuikNodeQuikNode is building infrastructure to support the future of Web3.

McKayFollowMar 4 \u00b7 4 min readI\u2019ve been poking around lately on BATgrowth.com, which tracks adoption of Basic Attention Token by publishers looking for a new way to monetize their content. One trend that\u2019s immediately striking is that YouTube creators are easily the biggest BAT adopters to date.More on why that might be in a moment. But first some necessary background:BATgrowth.com generates its stats by independently measuring publisher registrations with Brave, a startup that makes a web browser that\u2019s the hub of the BAT ecosystem. The Brave browser contains a built-in wallet and features for publishers to measure and receive payment in BAT for their content\u2019s monthly traffic. But you have to get verified with Brave first to receive your tokens.There are currently three types of publishing channels eligible for monetization through this system \u2014 websites, YouTube channels, and Twitch channels. (That last one is a gamer-oriented video network, for the benefit of all the old farts reading this post :-)As of this writing, BATgrowth.com says there are 52,617 publishing channels registered with Brave. That total comprises:36,001 YouTube channels13,113 websites3,503 Twitch channelsIn other words, about 68 percent of all the registered properties so far are YouTube channels. My hunch is that this dominance tells us a couple things about the state of monetizing video in 2019 \u2014 some of it good, some bad.The good news: BAT is growing rapidly as a viable option to monetize video, with the number of verified YouTube channels up more than 50 percent so far this year. I don\u2019t suspect anyone is making bread-and-butter type revenue off BAT alone yet, but who knows. In any case, it\u2019s great that creators\u2019 options are growing.Also good: YouTube has an application programming interface (API) for developers that allows Brave to integrate with their platform easily. This detail does bear mentioning in YouTube\u2019s favor. However, that brings us to\u2026The bad: YouTube proper has sucked for years as a way for creators to make real money, with no apparent end in sight. I\u2019m by no means the first person to point out that the video platform, currently owned by Alphabet (market cap: ~$800 billion), should probably be spending more out of its own pocket to support creators. Perhaps that\u2019s why its members are so eager for something like BAT to complement whatever crumbs YouTube deigns to throw their way.For me, the earliest documentation of this problem was a detailed keynote that tech entrepreneur and investor Jason Calacanis gave at VidCon way back in 2013. At the time, he\u2019d had a project funded directly through one of YouTube\u2019s early partnership programs but declined to take a follow-on round from them, because the terms were too crappy.In the years since, YouTube has expanded partner programs, including its Netflix-like YouTube Originals product. But you still hear frequent complaints about creators\u2019 revenue cut on the platform, especially from the plebes who have little or no formal relationship with YouTube. Invariably, these complaints end up echoing what Calacanis said six years ago, even now.I say that as someone who\u2019s now registered three publishing channels with Brave \u2014 my personal YouTube channel; my personal web domain pmckay.com; and Indizr.com, which I\u2019m trying to build out as a blog. The latter domain was my real priority to register, but while I was at it, I figured I might as well include the others as well.My YouTube channel is pretty inactive, with the last upload posted about five years ago when I was testing a video app I\u2019d built with the YouTube API. But if I post anything new there now, and if anyone watches it, I\u2019ll get a little bit of BAT in return. Nice and straightforward and covers all my channel\u2019s traffic immediately.By comparison, I\u2019m not eligible to monetize the channel at all via YouTube\u2019s main creator partnership program at this point. By their standards, channels have to have a minimum of 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 hours of watch time over the preceding 12 months, and then pass an in-house approval by an actual human who vets channels, before getting any revenue share whatsoever.So, yeah, I could theoretically, perhaps get a little something from YouTube at some point down the line from my little-used channel. But I\u2019d have to do a bunch of work in the first place, 100 percent free, over a stretch of time just to get to that point.See the difference?

Prior to NKN, if a sender client (a mobile app, for example) wants to send some data to a receiver client, the receiver needs to be publicly accessible, which is not practical for consumer applications, or they have to be both connected to some centralized server/platform, which will introduce additional cost (to build a relay service or pay for the service) and security vulnerability (data exposed to centralized server or 3rd party service). But now with NKN client, both sender and receiver and stay private in any network condition, and they don\u2019t need any centralized server or platform. The data will be routed and delivered in a purely decentralized way, end to end encrypted, and free. This is made possible thanks to the NKN public blockchain.However, there is no free lunch. Packets sent by NKN client are routed through NKN network, a global overlay network, in order for the generated signature chain to be considered safe for consensus. Typically, a packet path consists of multiple hops in the public Internet, which increases latency and packet loss rate. We have designed and implemented proximity routing and a few other mechanisms that can significantly improve latency and reliability, but it\u2019s still hard to beat direct connection (assuming they could) if sender and receiver are not far away from each other.Luckily, there is a way to greatly improve both latency and reliability by utilizing NKN\u2019s overlay architecture and consuming more bandwidth. To understand how it works, let\u2019s first review some related parts of the NKN client protocol:Each NKN client has a NKN address of the form identifier.publicKey, where identifier is an arbitrary string.Each NKN client is connected to a NKN node whose ID is closest to the hash of its NKN address, i.e. hash(identifier.publicKey).Now we can describe our solution: both sender and receiver can create multiple sub-clients by adding an additional string to the identifier. For example, instead of creating a client nkn.publicKey, we can create X clients, where i-th client\u2019s address is __i__.nkn.publicKey. Now if the sender wants to send a packet to receiver, all its sub-clients will send the same packet concurrently, where the i-th sender client will send the packet to i-th receiver client. Whichever packet arrives firstly will trigger receiver\u2019s onmessage event, and the rest will be ignored.The above protocol works well in NKN because by adding additional identifier, we are creating multiple independent clients that connect to different, unrelated NKN nodes, so the packet is being sent concurrently in a few independent paths (unless the sender or receiver\u2019s network has a problem). If node on a path has some problem, it won\u2019t affect other paths. Therefore, the packet loss rate decreases exponentially as the concurrency goes up:p_multiple_loss = p_loss ^ Xand similarly for latency:p_multiple(latency > t) = p(latency > t) ^ XTo give some more concrete examples, if the single-client packet loss rate is 1% (not the actual data, just an example), and we are creating 3 sub-clients, then the actual packet loss rate will be 0.0001%, i.e. reliability is 99.9999%.The above protocol has been implemented in JavaScript as nkn-multiclient-js. It is a drop-in replacement of nkn-client-js and can be used in the same way as nkn-client-js.The improvement in latency and reliability comes with more bandwidth usage as cost, so it\u2019s more suitable for applications that are sensitive to latency or reliability but not throughput. For example, d-chat, an awesome decentralized chat running as Chrome/Firefox extension, uses nkn-multiclient-js to improve message reliability and latency.A potential improvement to the above protocol is using erasure coding to control latency-throughput tradeoff. Instead of sending the same packet X times using X sub-clients, we can make use of erasure coding and send X different packets using X different sub-clients such that we can decode the original packet once we have K out of X packets. This way one can have lower latency but lower throughput using smaller K/X, or higher throughput but higher latency using larger K/X.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Programming", "Tech", "Blockchain", "Web3"]}, {"title": "Creating Ethereum Smart Contracts via Command Line", "post_link": "https://medium.com/quiknode/creating-ethereum-smart-contracts-via-command-line-e817aa4ef8a?source=search_post", "author_name": "Gaurav Agrawal", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@gaurav.agrawal", "publish_date": "2019-05-16", "last_modified_date": "2019-05-16", "readtime": "4.37", "claps": 4, "voters": 2, "content": "Photo by Shahadat Shemul on UnsplashCreating Ethereum Smart Contracts via Command LineAn interactive command line alternative for your favorite Smart Contract development tool (like Truffle!)Gaurav AgrawalFollowMay 16 \u00b7 5 min readIn last week\u2019s article, we talked about how to interact with an already-deployed Smart Contract using sbt-ethereum.

This time, we need to create our own repository.To get sbt-ethereum project\u2019s template, we will use giter8. Giter8 is a command line tool to generate files and directories from templates published on Github or any other git repository. Giter8 helps us by scaffolding projects based on a pre-defined template.Use this command to create a project repository:sbt new swaldman/solidity-seed.g8As sbt-ethereum is an interactive build tool, this command will ask a few questions:[info] Loading project definition from /Users/testuser/project[info] Set current project to testuser (in build file:/Users/testuser/)A minimal solidity project for sbt-ethereum name [my-solidity-project]: eth-timelockversion [0.0.1-SNAPSHOT]: sbt_ethereum_version [0.1.7-SNAPSHOT]: sbt_version [1.2.8]: Template applied in ./eth-timelockThis will create a new eth-timelock directory (see above, we have given eth-timelock as a project name). This is how the directory structure looks like:Now we are ready to create our first contract. Remember, create all contracts under src/main/solidity .We are going to create Timelock contract. It accepts payment of ETH when the contract is created, and only allows that ETH to be withdrawn by the creator of the contract after a specified delay.Create a Timelock.sol file under src/main/solidityTimelock.solNow let's compile our project.First, run sbt inside your eth-timelock directory:$ sbt[info] Loading settings for project eth-timelock from build.sbt ...[info] Set current project to eth-timelock (in build file:/Users/testuser/eth-timelock/)[info] Updating available solidity compiler set.[info] sbt-ethereum-0.1.7-SNAPSHOT successfully initialized (built Sun, 17 Feb 2019 21:58:11 -0800)Next run compile :sbt:eth-timelock> compile[info] Compiling 1 Solidity source to /Users/testuser/eth-timelock/target/ethereum/solidity...[info] Compiling 'Timelock.sol'.

You can see ABI get created under /target/ethereum/solidity .Now we are ready to deploy our Smart Contract. But before that, if you want to switch the network, you can like this:First, check your network with ethNodeChainIdPrint . sbt-etherum has MainNet set by default. Let\u2019s change it to Ropsten (if you want some other testnet, feel free to do so too).ethNodeChainIdOverrideSet 3Here, 3 is the Ropsten network id. Remember, you should have a bit of ETH in your account to deploy the contract.Now let\u2019s start deploying:sbt:eth-timelock> ethTransactionDeploy Timelock <TAB>Always use Tab, sbt-ethereum has very rich Tab support for command completion. When you press Tab, it will tell you what to do next.Our Smart Contract will need two parameters:days \u2014 The number of days when the owner will be able to withdraw Ether.seconds \u2014 Number of seconds when the owner will be able to withdraw Ether.We\u2019ll need the Smart Contract\u2019s compute time using days + seconds, so let\u2019s pass 0 days and 300 seconds (5 minutes):ethTransactionDeploy Timelock 0 300 <TAB>Now we need to pass the Ether amount, which will lock the contract for the given time. You can pass ETH amount using wei, gwei, szabo, finney, or ether units.Let\u2019s lock 10 wei for 5 minutes (300 seconds):ethTransactionDeploy Timelock 0 300 10 weiThis will ask you to unlock your wallet using your passphrase and then ask you to submit the transaction. It will also ask to provide an alias name for your deployed contract.Once done, it will give you deployed contract address which you can see on Etherscan. Let check the balance of the contract using:ethAddressBalance timelockHere timelock is alias name which we used while deploying our contract.Interacting with your Smart ContractNow, before 5 minutes runs out, let\u2019s mock-test our Smart Contract using ethTransactionMock. This simulates a transaction on our Ethereum Node, but does not actually execute the transaction. So let\u2019s try that:sbt:eth-timelock> ethTransactionMock timelock withdrawIf you execute this within 5 minutes of deploying the Smart Contract, you will see an error. Execute the above command after 5 minutes and you will see a success message, but it does not run the command actually.Now let\u2019s actually withdraw our 10 wei from the contract after 5 minutes using:ethTransactionInvoke timelock withdrawThis will create a transaction and withdraw the locked 10 wei. Once this command succeeds, you can check the balance of the contract again:ethAddressBalance timelockConclusionThat\u2019s it for today!

Join the Meetup page to hear about our next event.Lola, Andy and RyanWhat can Edinburgh\u2019s less-than-adequate* pizza scene tell us about decentralized services and trustless identityNow there\u2019s a sentence I never thought I\u2019d write\u2026 and I wouldn\u2019t blame you if it\u2019s left you scratching your head or leaning in for a re-read.But this was the basis of our latest event, Pizza Block and the answer is: well, a lot actually.What on earth is Pizza Block?Pizza Block is a wonderfully thought-provoking game devised by Chris, Jonathan and errr, Chris from the Design Informatics team at the University of Edinburgh. It gives participants a glimpse into how decentralized technologies could shape how we do business and prove our credentials without having to share large swathes of personal data.Volunteers finding out from enterprises the skills they need to get work in the Pizza Block gameThe basic premiseThe workshop has three roles that participants can play:Volunteers who need to acquire skills in order to work for the enterprisesEnterprises who need volunteers to prepare and deliver pizzas to their customersTraining centres who need to sell their courses which provide skillsHow it worksI hope you\u2019re sitting down for this. Here goes\u2026Everyone gets a unique stamp \u2014 this represents a cryptographic keyEnterprises advertise jobs that volunteers might wantEach job has skill requirements that volunteers must meetVolunteers pay for skills in tokens, proof of those skills are subsequently tokenised and stored in the volunteer\u2019s wallet. This is signed/verified by both parties using a unique stamp.A record of this transaction is sent to the public ledger.Volunteers can show that token to the enterprises, proving they have that skill. The enterprise can then give them that job, safe in the knowledge they\u2019re qualified. This is a neat way of thinking about smart contracts: if criteria a,b and c are met, allow x, y and z. This smart contract is then signed/verified by both parties using the same unique stamps.A record of this smart contract is sent to the public ledger.Volunteers can earn more tokens by verifying that the public ledger is correct. If you know your blockchain theory, this replicates the role of miners well. You can do this by matching the stamps to prove that volunteers did indeed have the skills they were claiming to have when asking for jobs at the enterprises.The enterprise with the most jobs completed and verified on the public ledger wins!Paying for skills with tokens (left) and then using the skills to prove capability for job experience (right)What we learned on the nightFirstly, regardless of the subject matter, it reminded us just how great games are at helping you understanding highly complex topics. As designers ourselves, workshops are a go-to format for exploring a complex topic. The detail put into the structure, prompts and tools for the workshop made it not just fun but meant we could get stuck in even before we really understood all the rules.A little hesitancy and confusion at first was followed by volunteers feverishly rushing between the training centre and the enterprises to add proof of skills and experience to their wallet.Your paper wallet complete with skills and experience stickersYour identity is more controllable on chainYou have a lot more say over who you share your identity with on the blockchain. You can also be more selective, choosing only to share what is mutually deemed necessary by both parties. For example, in the game the enterprises were only interested that we had the skills required to do the work. So we only needed to share this information with them \u2014 they didn\u2019t need anything else. This means our personal data might finally become personal again.Your identity is tamper-proof on chainYou can store proven claims about your identity in a safe and permanent way on the blockchain because of the chain part. Every transaction is part of a chain, meaning any modification to a record would \u201cunlink\u201d the chain so to speak. For example, if your university signs and verifies that you have the degree you\u2019re claiming and then that gets put on the blockchain \u2014 you\u2019ve got yourself permanent proof of your degree. Once we had proof of graduating from our pizza making classes, this was added to the public ledger, where any after-the-fact modifications would have been obvious and immediately discounted.Your identity is self-sovereign on chainOnce your identity is on the blockchain, claims about you identity can be verified by others in the network. In the game, we were able to use the public ledger to verify that individuals had the skills and experience they were claiming. This means we won\u2019t necessarily need to rely on institutions, which don\u2019t always act in our best interests, to control elements of our digital identity.Adding and verifying transactions on the public ledgerWhen is a wallet not a wallet?All of this challenged a common perception about crypto wallets. Amidst the boom and bust, bull and bear rhetoric surrounding the space, it\u2019s easy to forget that decentralization is about more than buying low and selling high. It got me thinking especially about whether the metaphor is more damaging than it is helpful. When you\u2019re able to use a \u201cwallet\u201d to prove you have skills, expertise and more\u2026 is it still just a wallet? To get technical for a second, your \u201cwallet\u201d never actually holds any funds.A \u201cwallet\u201d is a UI for showing the data associated with a public key, on the blockchain (or public ledger referenced above). To see that data you need to have the private key. This to me makes it more like a vault or a safe which holds proofs and deeds about what you own, the skills you have and how much value is associated with your public key.Finding out the winning enterprise and wrapping things upAnd that closes the pizza box lid on this oneThanks again to Chris, Chris and Jonathan from Design Informatics and everyone at Modern Human.

Common questions include:\u201cHow is it possible to store data on random computers around the world?\u201d\u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound secure\u2026. Is it?!?\u201d\u201cIs this a real thing?\u201dLet me tell you, it\u2019s real and it\u2019s spectacular!The Lifecycle of a FileWhen files are uploaded to the Storj network, the first thing that happens is the Uplink, which runs on the local machine uploading the files to the network, determines if the file is small enough to be stored as an inline segment. I will discuss the difference between inline and remote segments later in this post but for the rest of this section assume we are referring to a remote segment. The Uplink then sends an upload request to the Satellite, which includes the Uplink\u2019s API key so that the Satellite can validate if that Uplink is authorized to upload data to the project and bucket that it requested. If there are no issues with the authorization, the Satellite then compiles some information to send back to the Uplink.This information includes a list of storage nodes (where the data can be stored) and an order limit for the Uplink. The list of storage nodes will include nodes with varying levels of reputation, as well as the information that the Uplink needs in order to establish a connection with them such as IP/port. Check out our blog about reputation to read more about what type of criteria determines whether a node is reliable or not, and how the network disqualifies poorly behaved nodes. The Uplink will use the order limit as proof that the Satellite authorized its uploads when the Uplink establishes connections with storage nodes. Order limits are like an empty tank that the Satellite gives the Uplink. As the Uplink uploads more data over time, that empty tank will begin to fill. Once it reaches its limit, the Uplink won\u2019t be able to upload any more, because it has reached the amount that was agreed upon with the Satellite. While this seems like a lot of back and forth, this all happens in microseconds.At this point, the Uplink has been given the green light to store data on the network. From the order limit and other info shared by the Satellite, It creates orders for each of the storage nodes. The storage nodes will later send these orders to the Satellite.Next, the Uplink begins breaking down the file into segments, then stripes, after which it erasure codes each stripe to produce erasure shares. The Uplink then concatenates the erasure shares into pieces. This may seem like overkill, but it\u2019s actually a key process of the network because it enables buffered file streaming by allowing the downloading, decrypting and recompiling of pieces of files, rather than waiting for the entire file to be downloaded first. These pieces are what is uploaded to storage nodes, and at this time the network begins to send all the pieces of the file to each storage node, in parallel. Because a 1 TB file might be uploaded to a thousand different nodes, the process goes very quickly as there is generally not a bottleneck on the storage node side.When the storage nodes receive the pieces, they hash them and send the hash of each piece back to the Uplink in a signed message. With the message signed by storage nodes, the Satellite can later audit both Uplinks and storage nodes for honest behavior.The Uplink hashes all of the hashes it received from the storage nodes and then sends them to the Satellite, which stores a pointer to the file in its database. The pointerDB contains information about which storage nodes are storing which pieces. That way when the Uplink needs to download the file, the Satellite can tell it which storage nodes are holding the pieces it needs to download.An Aside About Inline vs. Remote SegmentsBefore the Uplink first contacts the Satellite, it must determine how big the file is and how big its pieces would be. In some instances, files might be so small that the metadata to store them (which keeps track of where the file\u2019s pieces are located and the corresponding NodeIDs) would actually be larger than the file itself. If this is the case, the Uplink and Satellite would determine that the file should actually be stored inline on the Satellite, rather than distributed across a network of storage nodes. This maximizes the efficiency of costs, and we don\u2019t foresee this occurring very regularly. These inline segments are also encrypted client-side for security and privacy. Remote segments are those that will be erasure encoded and distributed across the network. A remote segment is larger than the metadata required to keep track of its bookkeeping.Repairing Data When Nodes Go OfflineAs storage nodes go offline, the Satellite is responsible for \u201crepairing\u201d those missing pieces on the network. To execute a repair, the Satellite determines how many pieces a file has on the network and replenishes those that are missing if they fall under a threshold. This ensures that the file\u2019s durability is maintained. If you want to learn more about our repair system, you can check out this blog.Recompiling Decentralized Data During DownloadWhen a user decides they need to download a file, the network begins the short process of downloading and assembling a file from its various pieces. The Uplink contacts the Satellite to begin the process of downloading the file. The Satellite returns data about the file\u2019s pieces, specifically a list of nodes, with IP and port addresses, storing pieces and other metadata that helps the Uplink in the file download process. The Satellite returns a list of nodes that the Uplink may choose to download from.Once the Uplink receives the data it needs from the Satellite, it reaches out to the storage nodes storing file pieces and begins downloading them in parallel. If an Uplink needs 10 file pieces to rebuild a file, it will actually download 12 or 13 pieces, to accelerate the file download. That way the file can be rebuilt once the fastest 10 nodes complete the delivery of their corresponding file pieces. Once the needed file pieces are downloaded, the Uplink cancels any remaining downloads, reconstitutes the file from its pieces, unencrypts the file, and serves it up.Ridiculously Resilient, Highly DistributedAll of these steps may seem super complex, but they happen in microseconds, faster than what one would experience on a legacy, centralized cloud storage solution. Building decentralized systems is definitely not the easiest challenge to solve, which is why our team is committing so many resources to engineer the network. We are very passionate about building decentralized/distributed systems that are not only easy-to-use but better in nearly every way when compared to their centralized counterparts. From uploading your first file to building a web-scale application on top of the network, we hope you enjoy your journey down Decentralization Drive.By Brandon Iglesias, Storj LabsOriginally published at https://storj.io on Apr 23, 2019", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Cloud Computing", "Decentralization", "Web3", "Distributed Systems"]}, {"title": "We have to talk about flow control", "post_link": "https://medium.com/dua-art/we-have-to-talk-about-flow-control-a6d8bf1483bc?source=search_post", "author_name": "Felipe Duarte", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@felipeduarte", "publish_date": "2018-10-24", "last_modified_date": "2018-10-28", "readtime": "1.95", "claps": 1, "voters": 1, "content": "We have to talk about flow controlTendencies that can turn a decentralised organisation into just a badly centralised one. (Text written for the community blog of the Genesis Alpha DAO)Felipe DuarteFollowOct 24, 2018 \u00b7 2 min readIt would be easier to spot if this happened IRLWhat am I calling flow control?Flow control is the voluntary maximization of information asymmetry, permanent or temporary, to seize an opportunity.The higher the stake an agent has in a system, the more likely he is to hold information on its processes and history, the more he\u2019s prone to desire considerable authorship over its visions for the future. Whenever such a well informed agent feels there\u2019s a positive opportunity to bring these visions to life or a chance to keep other agents from manifesting a competing narrative, there will be the temptation to purposefully control the information flow.The more useful and present in decision making an agent is, the more peer-approved contributions the agent accumulates, the more opportunities will come about to maximize information asymmetry, decreasing \u2018agency clarity\u2019 for other agents. The more incentives align as to reward this practice ubiquitously, the more we favour the emergence of gatekeepers so strong that the necessity to win over their approval might stifle generosity, trust, and collaborative innovation in the system.The presence of financial incentives is not the only trigger for this instinct. All chances to earn power and privilege will trigger this response in individuals. The more we are able to spot it, design against it, on and off-chain, the more distributed the organisation will become. Not all manifestations of flow control are necessarily malevolent by nature or intention. But it felt to me that this needed a name.We\u2019re likely to be at both sides of this equation multiples times per day during our lives, and flow control is the norm rather then the exception in centralized organisations, job relations, nuclear families, and romantic relationships. It\u2019s the excess of its manifestation that turns culture toxic. It might lead agents to walk on eggshells, forgoing autonomy for safety. In its complete absence, an army would not be possible, and in its absolute presence, we\u2019ve witnessed humanity in its most horrendous.True friendships are the sort of bond that can only thrive in emotional environments of low flow control. As soon as mistrust seeps into the system, when instances of the practice come to light \u2014 gone is the spontaneity, joy, and the true potential for the development of a sensation of support and belonging. It\u2019s up to us to design for generosity and spontaneous creation.Don\u2019t worry. Collaboration and competition are two incomplete attempts at naming something bigger and more mysterious. We should be fine. But at some point, we might have to talk about flow control.For a more in depth discussion, please refer to the \u201cDAO Defense Protocol.\u201d", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Future Of Work", "Blockchain", "Decentralized", "Web3", "Governance"]}, {"title": "Announcing Beta: Pioneer 1 V3 and Tardigrade Are Here", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@storjproject/announcing-beta-pioneer-1-v3-and-tardigrade-are-here-ccad39d748e2?source=search_post", "author_name": "Storj Labs", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@storjproject", "publish_date": "2019-08-22", "last_modified_date": "2019-08-23", "readtime": "2.30", "claps": 1, "voters": 1, "content": "Announcing Beta: Pioneer 1 V3 and Tardigrade Are HereStorj LabsFollowAug 22 \u00b7 3 min readAfter a lot of hard work, we couldn\u2019t be happier to announce that Pioneer Beta for the V3 network has arrived. Now that V3 is here, we\u2019re also ready to launch the beta for Tardigrade decentralized cloud object storage. So, what changes are coming with the V3 network? V3 is more scalable, performant, secure, decentralized, and economical than previous offerings. It was specifically built with the enterprise in mind, focusing on performance, availability, and reliability similar to major providers, at half the price.Tardigrade is built on the Storj network and is backed by enterprise-grade SLAs comparable to traditional cloud storage providers, which means users can rest assured their data is securely stored. Because Tardigrade uses the Minio S3 gateway, it can be implemented by changing just a few lines of code, which allows potential users to try out the Storj network and the Tardigrade platform without having to integrate APIs through its developer library.Here are some of the key features of the Pioneer beta release that Tardigrade enterprise users will enjoy:Scalability \u2014 Tardigrade has been designed to scale to support exabytes of data.Performance \u2014 Tardigrade will deliver performance comparable to Amazon S3 and other centralized cloud storage providers. Even while in beta, Tardigrade has delivered upload and download speeds that are on par with or better than S3. For example, a 10 MB file can be uploaded to the network with a median time of 2.15 seconds and downloaded with a median time of 1.69 seconds. Even more impressively, even at the 95th percentile, those times change by less than a quarter of a second.Durability \u2014 Since the final alpha network wipe, Tardigrade has delivered 100% durability (i.e. no file loss).Retrievability \u2014 The ability to download a file on the first attempt is over 99.93%.Affordability \u2014 At half the price of centralized cloud storage providers, Tardigrade can save users millions on their cloud storage bills.Easy-to-use \u2014 Designed specifically for users to be intuitive and simple to use with built-in Amazon S3 compatibility.Resilient \u2014 Decentralized storage is architected to be inherently more reliable and resilient than centralized offerings.Private \u2014 Default client-side encryption and file sharding spread over a decentralized network ensures that only people with encryption keys can access data.Tardigrade users can incorporate the Minio S3 gateway and start storing data on the network within just a few minutes of setting it up. The platform can also be integrated into applications using the CLI and libuplink developer library in Golang, C, and Android to take full advantage of the network\u2019s capabilities. These libraries provide similar ease-of-development commands and bindings that are consistent with common languages, making integration intuitive.We can\u2019t wait to see what our OSPP members and their users do with Tardigrade. Connectors are coming soon that will allow you to financially support your favorite OSS every time you store data in the cloud. Take a look at our partner\u2019s page to see who is already utilizing Tardigrade to their benefit.We can\u2019t wait for you to try Tardigrade out yourself and take advantage of the improvements to the V3 network.Join the waitlist today.By JT Olio And Brandon Iglesias, Storj LabsOriginally published at https://storj.io on August 22, 2019", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Cloud Computing", "Blockchain", "Decentralization", "Web3", "Distributed Systems"]}, {"title": "April 2019 Newsletter", "post_link": "https://medium.com/monolith/april-2019-newsletter-4e889031273c?source=search_post", "author_name": "Monolith", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@Monolith", "publish_date": "2019-04-26", "last_modified_date": "2019-04-26", "readtime": "1.94", "claps": 1, "voters": 1, "content": "April 2019 NewsletterMonolithFollowApr 26 \u00b7 2 min readHere\u2019s what\u2019s on the menu for April \u2014 opening up the TokenCard alpha further, adding \u20ac to our card, TKN on Ethfinex, and an introduction to the latest addition to Team Token: Brice, our new community manager \u2b07\ufe0fTokenCard Alpha Access, Now Open to AllLast Monday, we proudly opened up the sign-up for the first TokenCard Visa\u00ae Debit cards to Crowdsale contributors.

Isn\u2019t it difficult?No, sbt keeps things basic and manages a lot of things behind the scenes to maintain simplicity.What does sbt-ethereum provide?Wallet functionalitySmart contract development functionalityEthereum blockchain interactionsENS supportEtherscan integrationYes! All of above through command line. Now let's see sbt-ethereum in action.InstallationWe\u2019ll be using Ubuntu (if you are using Windows, follow these instructions).Clone this GitHub repo:git clone https://github.com/swaldman/eth-command-line.git --branch 0.1.10Now, go inside the directory:$ cd eth-command-lineIf you do ls , you can see the below files:$ lsLICENSE\t\tREADME.md\tbuild.sbt\tproject\t\tsbtwHere, sbtw is a wrapper script which will install sbt.$ ./sbtwAs sbt-ethereum is an interactive tool, during installation it will ask a few questions to set up your wallet. You can set a wallet later too, but for now, you will see questions like \ud83d\udc47There are no wallets in the sbt-ethereum keystore. Would you like to generate one? [y/n] yWould you like the new address '0x1144f4f7aad0c463c667e0f8d73fc13f1e7e86a2' to be the default sender on chain with ID 1? [y/n] yRunning commands in sbt-ethereumsbt-ethereum strives for simplicity and provides easy-to-read commands. For example, it uses ethAddressAlias rather than something like etaa, eta. This makes commands bigger and difficult to type, that's why sbt supports rich tab completions. You can check the full list of sbt commands here.Taking BackupsYour wallets and address aliases, as well as other information such as your transaction history, smart contract compilations, and ABIs of contracts you interact with, are stored in the sbt-ethereum \u201cshoebox\u201d, which you will want to get into the habit of backing up. So, using the command ethShoeboxBackup (which takes no arguments).The command is interactive. It will ask us for a directory in which we would like to store backups (which will be retained \u2014 in the shoebox! \u2014 for optional future reuse). Provide a directory appropriate to your system. You may want to back up to a thumb drive or external disk, so if something happens to your computer\u2019s hard disk, you have a copy elsewhere.We can restore our shoebox, if something bad happens, from the generated file using ethShoeboxRestore.Connect your QuikNode to sbt-ethereumWe can connect our Ethereum node to sbt-ethereum (sbt may have a default ETH node you can use for testing, however their documentation recommends using a personal node for reliability and performance).Signup for QuikNode, if you want the fastest and best experience for interacting with an Ethereum node.Remember you can use TAB to complete your commands. Let\u2019s connect to our Ethereum node (I masked my QuikNode Web3 URL, you can get yours here.)sbt:eth-command-line> ethNodeUrlDefaultSet https://xxxx-xxxx-xxxx.quiknode.io/uuid/token/To check the current node URL, let\u2019s run command to check the latest block number:sbt:eth-command-line> ethNodeBlockNumberPrintYou can override or change your default Node configuration whenever you like.For that, sbt provides the following commands:ethNodeBlockNumberPrint       ethNodeChainId                ethNodeChainIdDefaultDrop     ethNodeChainIdDefaultPrint    ethNodeChainIdDefaultSet      ethNodeChainIdOverride        ethNodeChainIdOverrideDrop    ethNodeChainIdOverridePrint   ethNodeChainIdOverrideSet     ethNodeChainIdPrint           ethNodeUrl                    ethNodeUrlDefaultDrop         ethNodeUrlDefaultPrint        ethNodeUrlDefaultSet          ethNodeUrlOverride            ethNodeUrlOverrideDrop        ethNodeUrlOverridePrint       ethNodeUrlOverrideSet         ethNodeUrlPrintUsing AliasEveryone knows that working with addresses can be problematic. We, humans, are not designed for working with hexadecimal values (machines are) \u2014 so remembering them or even just matching them correctly can be difficult.

You have two choices:\u201cPlanet hopping\u201d: go via moon to Mars, from Mars to Tatooin, through Hoth and Naboo, and then land on Endor. It takes a bit of time, but costs little gas and travels securely.\u201cGalactic Express\u201d: Head to the nearest Hyperspace terminal (on the moon), pay for a lot of gas, and boom, it zooms your spaceship straight to Endor in a few minutes.Luckily, you also have these two choices when using NKN to send data from one client to another client. In the next two chapters, we will delve into the details of how they work, how they differ, and how they can best serve different types of applications over the NKN Network.\u201cPlanet Hopping\u201d: Secure & FastThe \u201cnormal\u201d way to route packets through NKN Network is using NKN\u2019s significantly improved Chord Distributed Hash Table (DHT) algorithms. Chord DHT is secure and verifiable, meaning the choice of neighbors and route is verifiable given all the nodes addressed on the ring. The routing works such that:There is a virtual and very large ringAll NKN nodes are given a random but verifiable NKN addresses and mapped onto the ringThe sending node calculates the distance (clockwise on the ring) to find a neighbor closest to the destination addressThe selected Neighbor will relay the data to its neighbor closest to the receiver, etc, until the data reaches its destination.A more detailed description of the algorithm can be found in \u201cStephen Wolfram (Creator of NKS) Tries to Understand NKN\u201d:https://forum.nkn.org/t/stephen-wolfram-creator-of-nks-tries-to-understand-nkn/185In some cases, this mode of routing will add more hops and potentially more latency compared to the default route a packet will travel without NKN. There is a tradeoff between efficiency and security. The reason is that NKN\u2019s mining reward is based on Proof of Relay, or how much data a node relays for the network. So in order to prevent collusion attacks, it is critical that nodes cannot manipulate neighbors nor routing.But we have made two enhancements to the original Chord DHT algorithm to improve its efficiency without sacrificing the security and verifiability.Latency optimized routingNode A maintains latency information of all its neighbors (typically 50\u2013100 neighbors for each node in current NKN implementation). This latency data is based on not only the physical networking latency, but also the protocol level processing latency. Thus the NKN latency metric is a good indicator of overall quality of each hop.When data arrives at Node A for destination of Y, Node A has a choice among 3 next hop neighbors (B1, B2, B3) to forward. This group of neighbors is determined by NKN algorithm and cannot be picked by node A itself.Node A picks neighbor with the lowest latency, Node B1 at 23ms, among the 3 proposed by the NKN algorithm. Node A relay the data to Node B1.All decisions are local, and decisions are made at each subsequent hop until the data reaches the final destination.We have found that the default route in today\u2019s Internet is far from optimal. By selecting the lowest NKN Latency route, we can often improve the end user\u2019s Internet experience. But there is more.Concurrent multi-path routingWe can also combine multiple NKN routes for not only better latency, but also higher aggregated bandwidth. One good use case is large file transfer based on http/https and range request. The following diagram illustrates the concept of combining 3 NKN paths, but in reality our multi-client SDK supports any number of concurrent NKN routing paths. When one utilizes multiple concurrent path, he can either choose to minimize latency by sending more redundant data using different paths (e.g. nkn-multiclient: https://github.com/nknorg/nkn-multiclient-js), or choose to maximize throughput by sending different pieces of data using different paths (e.g. nkn-file-transfer: https://github.com/nknorg/nkn-file-transfer).And the test results show significant improvements. In late 2018 we did a prototype of a web accelerator and achieved a 167% \u2014 273% speed boost by using multi-path over our testnet. And the bigger the file, the better the boost.In August 2019, a recent test of large file transfers over NKN mainnet using nkn-file-transfer (https://github.com/nknorg/nkn-file-transfer) shows we are 460% the speed of WeChat and 160% of QQ. We used 8 concurrent (randomized and secure) paths over NKN Mainnet, between PC clients in China and in California.\u201cGalactic Express\u201d: Direct & FasterBut what if you want an even faster experience? As fast as a Hyperspace jump? And willing to pay gas for it?Yes you definitely can with the NKN network,but with a different mode of operation as illustrated in the examples below. This mode is specifically designed for applications that require the most direct and fastest service possible. The key is to connect to a single NKN Node which offers a direct route to the destination. In this case, the client pays the node directly as the traffic does not go through NKN\u2019s consensus and therefore does not have the opportunity to earn mining rewards for the traffic.App 1: nCDN for content deliveryClient connects to Node A, based on several factors such as geographical proximity, throughput, latency, and performance.Node A is an nCDN edge node, that caches content based on client demands.When a client wants to stream the latest \u201cStar Wars\u201d Movie, Node A discovers it does not have this movie in local cache. So Node A will fetch a copy from the Media Store. This only needs to happen once.Node A will serve the local copy of \u201cStar Wars\u201d directly to Client.If there are other users in the same geographical region that also want to stream \u201cStar Wars\u201d, then Node A can serve them directly with a local copy.Node A will be paid according to the amount of content delivery service it provided.App 2: TUNA and universal tunnelingTUNA, short for Tunnel Using NKN for any Application, is a platform built on top of NKN that allows everyone to turn any network based application into a service and monetize it based on usage. Some concrete examples are:Play high quality games via streaming, such as DOTA2, on a remote high end server with performance GPU.Work on advanced machine learning algorithms using the Jupyter notebook, utilizing the idle computing power of a remote high performance multi-core serverAccelerate access to a website using a remote web proxy or web acceleratorIn order to fulfill the high bandwidth and low latency requirements of these applications, the client only needs to connect to the NKN TUNA server where such services are hosted. The TUNA client pays via NKN to the TUNA node, based on the usage of certain services. In this case, we do not go through the randomized routing of NKN\u2019s \u201cNormal mode\u201d at all! So we can support services similar to the likes of the upcoming Google Stadia game streaming service.If we dive one level deeper, you can see that TUNA acts as a multiplexer between many different applications to utilize the same tunnel between the client and the NKN TUNA node. So all the client side applications talk to the server side as if both are residing on the same computer. No modification to the applications at all, which is the beauty and main attraction of TUNA solution.SummarySo Captain Narwhal\u2019s choices are clear depending on the type of application you are using over NKN\u2019s network., A simple side-by-side comparison is provided below:Captain Narwhal, may the force be with you and happy sailing across the vast NKN universe!About NKNNKN is the new kind of P2P network connectivity protocol & ecosystem powered by a novel public blockchain. We use economic incentives to motivate Internet users to share network connection and utilize unused bandwidth.

We launched the first beta of our V3 Storj software, and we simultaneously launched the beta for our Tardigrade Cloud Storage Service, which is (we expect) the first of many decentralized storage services built by many organizations using Storj software.This post discusses the very important qualification gateswe\u2019ve established for each of our major milestones: Pioneer 1 (beta 1), Pioneer 2 (beta 2), and Voyager (production). It also discusses where we stand in terms of meeting those gates.BackgroundOur goal with Tardigrade is ambitious: we aim to deliver the first truly enterprise-grade, decentralized cloud storage service. This means we not only have to deliver on the security, scale, and privacy promise of decentralization, but must also deliver enterprise-class durability, availability, performance, and support. This also has to measure up or be comparable to the well-established cloud service providers \u2014 and we also aim to do it at a fraction of their price. We also need to provide the proper economic support and incentives to our large and growing network of storage node operations, open source partners, and demand side partners.This isn\u2019t an easy task. Introducing any new storage technology is very difficult and cloud storage has an even bigger uphill battle, especially given the well established and generally well-regarded cloud services offered by some of the largest companies in the world. Hitting these lofty goals on a decentralized network, with enterprise-grade characteristics is much more difficult than building a centralized cloud service. In fact, it really hasn\u2019t ever been done before.Storj\u2019s V2 network (launched in 2017) achieved scale rapidly. We reached 150 PB of capacity, over 100,000 globally distributed nodes, and steady usage faster than expected. However, we didn\u2019t deliver durability and performance comparable to the centralized players. And the expansion factor of eight in V2 (i.e., we consumed 8 GB of total storage for every 1 GB stored) made it difficult to make the network work economically. To ensure that the V3 network is sustainably enterprise-grade, we took a different approach. We\u2019re S3 compliant, have an expansion factor of 2.7, and have the promise of far better durability, performance, and availability. We\u2019ve also proceeded much more deliberately, with an emphasis not only on code and on network growth, but also on network quality, stability, and performance. One of the important elements in achieving this has been the adoption of qualification gates.Qualification GatesIf you listened to our last town hall, you\u2019ve learned that we established a formal series of qualification gates for our two Tardigrade betas and this has informed us going into production. In general, you only get one chance to win customers over in the cloud storage space. So, to help ensure that we\u2019re truly enterprise-grade, we\u2019re holding to these gates. The gates are specific, objective criteria that we must meet in order to officially move into a particular phase. With this post, I\u2019d like to go into a bit more detail as to what our gates are for the various phases and where we stand now.We established a set of 15 gates for going into each of our major phases.A subset of those gates you\u2019ll find outlined in the table below. In the first column, we list the gates. In the second column, we list where we\u2019re at now. In the third through fifth columns, you\u2019ll see our gates for entering Pioneer 1 (beta 1), Pioneer 2 (beta 2), and finally Voyager (production). Any item in green has been met.You\u2019ll see that we\u2019ve not only met all of the gates heading into beta, but in many cases, we\u2019ve also met or exceeded our gates for beta 2 and production.A few notes of explanation about the gates:File DurabilityThis is perhaps the most important gate. Our goal is that no file is ever lost. After doing our last major alpha release 2.5 months ago, we haven\u2019t lost a single file or segment (i.e. durability of 100%). Our production goal is 99.9999999% (Nine, nines \u2014 meaning you\u2019re far more likely to win the lottery or be struck by lightning than lose a file on Tardigrade).We measure durability not only by randomly downloading large numbers of files, but also by looking at segment durability. While the random test is a sample, the segment durability looks at the entire population of segments.As a reminder, each file is broken up into one or more segments of 64 MB each. Each segment is (using Reed Solomon) divided into 80 pieces, of which any 29 can be used to reconstitute the segment. Each part of the 80 pieces is located on a different storage node in the network. A segment would be lost if the number of available pieces dropped below 29. However, long before that point, we would initiate a repair process by reconstituting all 80 pieces. In theory, we should never lose a file, since nodes have low correlation risk, operating on different hardware, different power supplies, different networks, with different operators, etc.As you can see from the graph below, we constantly measure the number of pieces available for segments in our network. We report the median number of pieces for each segment, the distribution of pieces, and the segment with the lowest number of pieces. This means the \u201cleast healthy\u201d segment has never dipped below 57 pieces, and the median is holding steady at around 75. As is the case with many of our metrics, durability should only improve as we add more nodes to the network and a broader distribution of nodes.Figure 2: Segment Health Chart (Segments must have a minimum of 29 pieces to be reconstituted).Service AvailabilityService availability measures the availability of Satellites. We\u2019re currently at 99.95% availability on production Satellites (meaning the service as a whole should only be unavailable for four minutes in any given month). Our production goal is 99.995% (i.e., the service should only be unavailable for two minutes in any given month, or about four seconds per day).Segment RetrievabilityThis measures how many attempts to download a segment per day are successful. We test a randomly selected segment every minute, and (so far) are seeing success rates of above 99.93% (i.e. less than one attempt out of one thousand isn\u2019t successful on the first attempt). This doesn\u2019t mean the file is gone (durability is 100%); it just means a second attempt is necessary. Generally, this is because the Satellite isn\u2019t available or fewer than 30 nodes are available to serve pieces (either because they are temporarily offline or because they\u2019re at max capacity). While we\u2019re at our production goal, we\u2019re trying to take this number even higher to ensure retrievability for very large files that are composed of multiple segments. Retrievability should also improve as we add more nodes to the network.Upload PerformanceWe measure the time it takes to upload a 10 MB file and then we repeat this test for 100 files. We then compare the results to AWS, which is generally considered the gold standard for centralized cloud service. We not only look at the median time to upload, we also look at the long tail performance. Across a really broad range of file sizes and locations, we are comparable to (and at times faster than) AWS.For a beta, that\u2019s pretty encouraging. Moreover, we have a really tight distribution. Our 95th percentile time is only .16 s slower than our median time. (i.e. the slowest 5 files uploaded almost as fast as the median). This points to the power of decentralization and should only get better as we add more nodes and continue to add nodes that are distributed closer to the end users (ultimately, the speed of light becomes a factor).The above results are uploading from a location in Virginia (i.e. Eastern US) in conjunction with a satellite in Iowa (i.e Central US)When we look at Uploading from Belgium to a satellite in the Iowa, the times still look really good.NB: We intend to publish results for different file sizes and different geographies before Beta 2. We\u2019re also exploring COSBench benchmarking.Download PerformanceWe measure the time it takes to download and reconstitute a 10 MB file. We repeat this test for 100 files, and then compare the results to AWS. Across a really broad range of file sizes and locations, we are comparable to (and at times faster than) AWS. Our median download time is 1.69 seconds. We\u2019re especially excited about our tight distribution. Our 95th percentile time is only .19 s slower than our median time. (i.e. the slowest 5 files uploaded almost as fast as the median). This points to the power of decentralization and should only get better as we add more nodes and continue to add nodes that are distributed closer to the end users (ultimately, the speed of light becomes a factor).The above results are downloading to a location in Virginia (i.e. Eastern US) in conjunction with a satellite in Iowa (i.e Central US)When we look at downloading to a location in Belgium in conjunction with a satellite in the Iowa, the times still look really good.NB: We intend to publish results for different file sizes and different geographies before Beta 2. We\u2019re also exploring COSBench benchmarking.Proven CapacityOur SNO operators have offered up over 8 PB of capacity to the network. However, in keeping with our \u201ctrust but verify\u201d approach, we tend to look at proven capacity. Both Storj Labs and our partners have uploaded a lot of test and production data to the network during the alphas. (Over 2 PB of data to the network.) Our production goal is to be at 6 PB proven capacity, and we expect to exceed that goal by a wide margin.Note that while we believe the capacity of the network is significantly higher, we held ourselves to this more conservative, proven number. This number is more than an order of magnitude lower than the V2 network, which had a capacity of 150 PB at its peak. While we have several partners and beta customers with several petabytes of capacity, we\u2019re aiming to grow the network more gradually, so that we generally only have about three months of excess capacity at a time. This helps us ensure that all nodes are receiving economically interesting payouts.Number of Vetted NodesThis is the number of currently available, vetted nodes. When a node first joins the network, there is a probationary period, during which the node has to prove itself (e.g. maintaining a certain uptime and performance levels, passing all content audits). During that vetting period, the node only receives as small amount of non-critical data. Once vetted, a node can start receiving more data (and not just test data), but must continue to maintain uptime and audit requirements to avoid disqualification. The number of vetted nodes in the table above (over 1,500 nodes now), excludes any probationary nodes, any nodes temporarily offline, any nodes that have voluntarily quit the network, and any nodes that have been disqualified (e.g. due to missing uptime or audit requirements). Our production goal is 5,000 nodes \u2014 still a fraction of the V2 number.Vetted Node ChurnOur current node churn (excluding probationary nodes) is 3.07 %. Our beta 1 gate was 5%, and our beta 2 gate is 3.0%, so we\u2019re almost there. We\u2019re not yet at our production goal of 2%, but we\u2019re getting close.. Our system is very resilient to having any individual nodes (or even a significant percentage of nodes) churn. However, performance, economics, and most statistics all do better as we bring average node churn down.Other GatesWe have a wide variety of other gates. These include gates around code quality and test coverage, user and storage node operator set up success rates, various capabilities, payment success rates, peak network, and more. We also have gates around enablement of non-Storj Labs Tardigrade Satellites, and are aiming to be \u201cChaos Monkey\u201d and even \u201cChaos Gorilla\u201d resilient before production.We hit all seven gates for Beta 1, and have hit an additional two gates for Beta 2.CaveatsWe\u2019ve achieved results to date on a fairly small scale network, with ~75 users testing the network in addition to ourselves (including a large number of OSPP partners). We have over 11,000 developers on the waitlist, including some very large customers with very large data requirements. As we scale up, we certainly expect to hit some hiccups and encounter unexpected issues, which is why we\u2019ve added an extra beta cycle and are cautiously increasing the rate at which we add new users and new SNOs to the network. However, signs are looking really positive, and we hope to take most of the brakes completely off in the next couple of months.Stay tuned!

Which Satellites do you trust?Storj LabsFollowAug 6 \u00b7 6 min readOne of the most fundamental parts of a decentralized platform is that there is no single authority or owner. In a true decentralized ecosystem, everyone who participates is a critical contributor to the network.At production launch, the Storj network will allow anyone to operate a Satellite in addition to the Tardigrade Satellites operated by Storj Labs. Being a Satellite operator is a big commitment with very stringent uptime requirements, much more so than a storage node operator. If a storage node goes offline temporarily, data can still be recovered from other nodes. If a Satellite goes offline temporarily, the data stored by that Satellite could become unavailable. Satellites are also responsible for managing payments to storage nodes storing data for the Satellite as well.To understand how storage node operators and third-party Satellites (those not operated by Storj Labs) could best work together, we looked at many different options and surveyed 240 of our users to understand their priorities, needs, and concerns. The general feedback from our community centered on four things:Higher payouts \u2014 Participating in a decentralized ecosystem is largely driven by incentives. Higher payouts mean bigger incentives. For storage nodes, working with more trusted Satellites will ultimately mean more STORJ tokens earned.Minimal effort \u2014 Whether operating a storage node or a Satellite, community members want simple approaches that don\u2019t require a ton of extra work.Maintain control \u2014 Storage node and Satellite operators both value their privacy and anonymity (as much as possible), and don\u2019t want to work with just anyone.Trust \u2014 If participating in the network, community members want a way to know who to trust. Without guidelines to go by, they could be exploited or taken advantage of.Community feedback told us that we need to balance the privacy of storage node operators with the needs of Satellite operators. Storage node operators want to store data for more Satellites, but they are also concerned that third-party Satellites might not pay them, act ethically, or could create lots of work for them. There are also concerns that working with untrusted Satellites could expose storage nodes to attacks.Satellites need to have an easy way to recruit nodes to store data for them when the storage nodes might not even know they exist. They also need to be able to trust storage nodes, but luckily we already have a very extensive reputation system built out within the platform to identify trusted storage node operators.Keeping these two things in mind, there were three specific options we explored with these 240 community members:Opt outThis is the model currently suggested by our white paper. In this model, storage node operators start out skeptical of untrusted nodes, but ultimately automatically store data for all Satellites. Storage nodes allow a small amount of resources (and thus exposure) to untrusted Satellites, but assuming the Satellite pays reliably, Storage Nodes would over time increase that Satellite\u2019s resource allowance. Storage nodes (initially manually but ultimately automatically) would need to specifically opt out due to payment failures to avoid storing data for Satellites that fail to pay.ProsStorage nodes connect to all Satellites by default meaning they will store more data, in theory.Third-party Satellites have more storage nodes at their disposal.Requires the minimum amount of effort initially.ConsStorage nodes are left very exposed to Satellites and prone for abuse. Bad actors could set up a Satellite just to gather data about all the storage nodes, and operators, on the network. Satellites only need to pretend to be good long enough to get personally identifiable information from a storage node such as notification preferences or wallet address. This, in our view, is a pretty big downside.Storage nodes are more likely to store data for Satellites that are not trusted and do not pay storage nodes for the utility they provide on the network. Without additional improvements, every storage node must watch out for itself, and cannot benefit from the experience of other storage node operators working with other Satellites.Storage nodes would need to be very thorough to see if Satellites are actually paying them for the work they provide on the network.Until it is automated, which would not be immediately, this requires the most upkeep, as storage nodes would need to continually unsubscribe from all Satellites that join the network and want to send them data.In a large network, even if storage nodes only provide a small allowance to untrusted Satellite operators, untrusted Satellite operators still have many storage nodes on which to store data. A malicious Satellite operator could start a new Satellite every month and store a significant amount of data without paying anyone.Opt in \u2014 Satellite operator requestSatellites would recruit storage nodes by sending them requests asking them to store data. Storage nodes would then accept or decline that invite. Storage nodes would need to continually check back to see if they receive more invites.ProsExposes storage node operators to less risk and intrusion than the opt out model.Less work than opt out.Storage nodes have more control over who they work with.Easy to click a button and begin storing data for a Satellite.ConsRequires upkeep to track new Satellites that join the network.The request section of the storage node operator dashboard, where they accept and decline requests, will likely become very convoluted and filled with spam.Storage node operators would need to check their storage node operator dashboards regularly and spend time researching Satellites requesting that they store data.Storage node operators may only opt in to store data for Storj Labs\u2019 Tardigrade Satellites.No easy way to store data for a larger number of Satellites.Satellite operators must convince every storage node they want to work with to click the button if they haven\u2019t already.Opt in \u2014 Storage node operator selectSatellite operators wait for storage node operators to add their Satellite, at which time they get a new connection. Storage nodes can manually add Satellites by address or through community-hosted lists. Satellites added to these lists would automatically be added to the storage nodes\u2019 list of trusted Satellites.ProsEasier for storage node operators to opt in to a wider range of Satellites using lists.Has a set-it-and-forget-it approach.Better ensures that storage nodes do not store data for bad acting Satellites.Storage nodes choose the Satellites they connect to.Satellite operators only need to convince list hosts to add their Satellite to a list to get access to many storage nodes, instead of every storage node operator.Shortest roadmap and the quickest we can get something to users!ConsNew Satellite operators still do not get full access to the network automatically, unlike the original opt-out approach.Satellite operators must convince storage node operators and list hosts to add them via other means (there is no in-network messaging system).After weighing out all the pros and cons of the options, we decided Door #3, \u201cOpt in \u2014 Storage node operator select,\u201d would be the best approach. We believe it better balances the needs of Satellite operators with those of storage node operators.A Twist!, by M. Night ShyamalanThis third choice had some unexpected ramifications to our network. We currently use Kademlia, a distributed hash table, to enable storage nodes to discover Satellites. With storage node operators selecting which Satellites they work with using addresses directly and trusted lists, we actually eliminate the need for Kademlia! Surprise! The only thing we used Kademlia for was node discovery (although if you read our white paper, it\u2019s not actually a surprise), and node discovery now happens in a way that is better for users. The system remains just as decentralized but can operate in a much simpler and efficient way.In the next few weeks, watch for updates to our GitHub that will begin to make these changes. We will also be updating our white paper to reflect the dramatic implications of this product decision. In addition to changing the portions about node discovery and Kademlia, we\u2019ll also be adding a section on Graceful Exit. When we push the Pioneer 2 update, the final beta milestone ahead of production launch, we will have this change implemented and begin letting non-Tardigrade Satellites join the network before production launch.

For example: most of this high quality content created over the years cannot be effectively searched by Google or Baidu.The issue with using Instant Messaging for communication right now is that people tend to choose the easy way and just ping team members for every question, which reduces the efficiency of the team. We would like to move to a more asynchronous communication and leave pinging the team only for more urgent cases. Also moving to https://forum.nkn.org for most communication helps the community. Since every post is indexable and searchable, you are more likely to find answers to your question just by using search on the forum or searching using Google or Baidu. The forum.nkn.org is also search engine optimized.We encourage the community to use https://forum.nkn.org instead of Telegram or Discord from now on for customer support, questions about the project, insights, dev projects and communication about the project in general.https://forum.nkn.org should be the first place for everyone who wants to understand NKN and talk about the project.

In a decentralized cloud storage service, many of the core components that would be managed by a centralized solution need to be offloaded to various parts of the network, be it the Satellite, Uplink, or storage node. This includes encryption key management, node vetting, file repair, and storage node selection.Part of the node selection process aims to ensure data stored on the decentralized network is thoroughly distributed across the network of storage node operators. For data stored on the Storj network to be truly distributed, we need to look at how data is stored on various geographical scales. This has been a big part of our V3 network testing. A decentralized cloud storage platform isn\u2019t worth much if it\u2019s storing all the data on the same node- if that node goes down, it means the file is lost.Let\u2019s talk hypothetically for a moment and say your entire file is stored in a single city. If the power goes out in that city, or a natural disaster strikes, your data will be lost.Another hypothetical situation to think about: what if all of your data is stored in the same region? In this scenario, you could potentially lose access to your data in the event of an outage for any reason, whether it\u2019s a utility outage, natural disaster, or state-sponsored \u201cservice interruption.\u201dWith today\u2019s v0.14.3 release, we\u2019ve implemented a feature called IP filtering, which will ensure that no file pieces corresponding to the same file are stored in the same geographical area, based on logical subnets.Taking this approach ensures the network (and the data stored on it) remains decentralized with a wide geographical distribution. On the previous network, nodes were selected for new data storage on a per-node basis. Selecting nodes based on logical subnets means having more or fewer nodes in the same location won\u2019t cause more or less data to be stored. A single 40 TB node would receive the same amount of data as 10, 4 TB nodes on the same IP address.If you\u2019re storing data on the V3 network, or working on an integration, this means you\u2019re much less likely to lose data. If you\u2019re a storage node operator, this means that you won\u2019t receive any more (or less) data if you\u2019re running one, two, or 100 nodes from a single location.To maximize STORJ token earnings in the long run, storage node operators should be focused on maintaining a single node with consistent availability to maximize their reputation ahead of the beta and production launches. Nodes with high reputations will be chosen to store and return more data, which will result in them earning more STORJ tokens in the long run. If your node goes down for whatever reason, it\u2019s not a major problem. Just reconnect as soon as possible to keep your reputation high.If you have multiple hard drives storing data on the network, the recommendation is to run one node per hard drive.If you haven\u2019t joined the network as a storage node operator, and you have excess hard drive space and bandwidth to share, join the network and start earning STORJ tokens. It\u2019s not too late to join.

McKayFollowFeb 1 \u00b7 2 min readI\u2019ve previously posted about some of my favorite plain-English resources for newbies to learn what blockchain technology is. Today I want to address a separate but related question:Who cares? Even more specifically, why should an average Joe or Jane who\u2019s not a blockchain developer care about it?My short answer: Blockchain technology, because of its use of shared transaction ledgers, is inherently well-suited to address problems caused by middlemen in business or society. Anywhere that such a problem exists \u2014 usually in the form of increased cost, hassle, and general inefficiency imposed by the middleman \u2014 a blockchain tool may be able to help.That\u2019s what this stuff exists to do. It\u2019s what it was built from brass tacks to do. Even a cursory reading of Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s whitepaper documenting the design of bitcoin in 2008 \u2014 generally considered the Big Bang of blockchain technology in general \u2014 will demonstrate that.Of course, the real world we live in everyday has middleman problems galore. That\u2019s why blockchain enthusiasts are sometimes accused of being zealous to a cultish extreme.I try not to go full Jim Jones with it myself. But let it suffice that the promise of a more decentralized world (assuming we\u2019re willing to put in the hard, necessary implementation work) does excite me greatly.For example, I\u2019d say the struggling U.S. news industry essentially has a massive middleman problem in the form of Google, Facebook, and their Big Tech peers. These companies have effectively insinuated themselves as the gatekeepers between news orgs and their audience \u2014 a situation that ultimately makes the news orgs\u2019 business position untenable.The solution to this situation \u2014 one dear to my heart as an ex-reporter \u2014 isn\u2019t to get the Googles and Facebooks of the world to act more benevolently toward the news organizations, as popular tech coverage sometimes implies. The real solution is to engineer these middlemen out of the equation for news entirely, so that the folks actually producing the news can interact with the audience more directly again.This process will undoubtedly require some kind of new tool, which could very well be blockchain, in my opinion. Otherwise, if we allow the status quo to persist, the middlemen will always extract a prohibitive chunk of revenue from whatever business model publishers are using to support news, whether that\u2019s advertising or subscriptions or e-commerce or whatever.The tool to decentralize all that could also turn out to be some non-blockchain thing, I\u2019ll admit. But there does ultimately have to be some type of \u201cplatform killer,\u201d to borrow a colorful phrase that a friend who\u2019s a journalism professor recently mentioned to me.There are myriad examples of potential blockchain use cases that could be used from other industries as well, from banking to manufacturing to music to whatever else. I just started with the media use case because I\u2019m very familiar with it.

This is due to the trade-off between all dominant attributes of blockchains: decentralization, security, and scalability. Scalability is a big issue when it comes to evaluating the feasibility of tokenized use cases and the future of a token economy.In order to allow for a high degree of decentralization in a public and global network, blocks in \u201cProof-of-Work\u201d blockchains are limited in size and are created with some delay. This intentional process allows members of the network that are computationally weaker to participate since larger blocks are harder to process and network latency would prohibit them from receiving blocks. This, in turn, introduces a limit on transactions that can be included in a block, as well as a limit on how many blocks can be validated in a given timeframe. One of the greatest challenges of a distributed consensus like Proof-of-Work is therefore that it makes the network safe, but slow.Blockchains face a so-called \u201cscalability trilemma,\u201d which refers to the trade-off between all dominant attributes of blockchains: (I) decentralization; (II) security; and (III) scalability. Security is the most important aspect in a distributed network of untrusted actors. Decentralization is the premise of distributed networks. Scalability refers to the number of transactions a system can process per second. As a result of this tradeoff, the attribute of scalability wasn\u2019t a core feature in the early years of blockchain development. The demand of the technology was still marginal.Balancing scalability, decentralization, and network security might be the holy grail of decentralization. However, it might be resolved over time as the technology matures. It is comparable to the early days of the Internet, where bandwidth was still little and communication lines were slow, and we used to pull phone cables through our apartments to connect our computers with the Internet. Back then, the Internet had little throughput. The 56k modem was already a major upgrade to the 28k modem, and we still had to wait for pages to build up pixel by pixel. Over time, however, this issue was resolved, and it certainly didn\u2019t stop the WWW from evolving into what it is today.In the context of blockchains, many solutions have been proposed to make transactions faster and cheaper, paving the way for mass adoption of this new technology. There is ample debate whether this should be resolved on a protocol level, often making concessions to decentralization. In order to allow for more transaction volume, it would require granting more power to certain participants, thus increasing the level of centralization. One main protocol level alternative consensus mechanisms try to resolve the scalability issue is by introducing some kind of permission layer to guarantee trust. Sharding of the ledger, which refers to partitioning the ledger into several smaller parts, or alternative cryptographic algorithms are other means to address the scalability problem on the protocol level. As an alternative, various efforts have been made to move scalability solutions to a second layer, like sidechains or state channels. In these cases, user interaction is moved out of the blockchain, onto a second layer, while still allowing risk-free P2P transactions between participants.State ChannelsState channels offer a second layer on top of the blockchain, allowing transactions that could occur on-chain to get conducted off-chain, without significantly increasing the risk to any participant. Transactions get outsourced to a second layer, a private state channel, a two-way pathway, opened between two users, using a smart contract.State channels allow for the transfer of any state for any type of decentralized application; payment channels allow for the transfer of payments only. Both solutions require funds to be deposited to facilitate disputes. Each participant in the channel signs these transactions with their private key to ensure that they are undeniably true and authorized. This is a three-step process: (I) Parts of the blockchain state, such as funds, are locked via multi-signature or a smart contract. They can send funds to the other in channel alone. To update state on-chain, they need bilateral agreement, or to have a dispute; (II) These two parties update the state amongst themselves by constructing and signing transactions that would usually be submitted to the blockchain, but instead are merely held onto for now; (III) After a certain period, both parties submit the state back to the blockchain, which closes the state channel, until it is opened again.If two people have a business relation, they have ongoing back and forth payments to each other within a certain time period. Let\u2019s assume that Alice has 200 ETH and Bob has 100 ETH. Within a month, Alice sends ten payments of 10 ETH each and Bob sends Alice two payments of 20 ETH each. On an Ethereum blockchain, these transactions would each count as an individual transaction, twelve in total, which would clog the Ethereum Network bandwidth, thus making it slower. Furthermore, each single transaction would incur transaction fees. With a state channel, only the balance of transactions, after one month, needs to be settled on the blockchain, as two transactions only \u2014 the opening and closing of the channel.Keeping transactions off-chain and exclusively between both parties is also more privacy preserving. Everything happens within a channel, rather than being publicly broadcasted over the whole network and recorded on-chain. Only opening and closing transactions are known to the public. However, state channels need full availability of all participants involved. As the final closing of the channel, and therefore the final submission of state, could be submitted by one party maliciously, there is risk of funds involved if one doesn\u2019t look out for closing transactions. If such an attempt is caught, one can dispute the attack and have the other party penalized. Such an action can be outsourced to service providers looking out for such malicious attempts in exchange for a fee. Participants can use representatives acting on their behalf, but the possibility of the representative getting attacked or bribed makes it a security risk. State channels are useful for use cases where participants exchange many state updates over a long period of time, since there is an initial cost to create a channel and deploy the so-called judge contract. Once it is deployed, the cost per state update inside that channel is extremely low.The smart contract used to lock the state must know the participants of a given channel in advance. State channels, therefore, work well with a defined set of participants, but adding and removing participants requires a change in the smart contract or the creation of a new channel to add a new participant. Projects such as Lightning Network (Bitcoin) or Raiden Network (Ethereum) have come up with solutions based on a mesh of participants, so one does not have to create a new channel for every new participant to interact with. By creating a network out of all the channels, users\u2019 transactions can be routed over other people\u2019s channels, but only as long as there is some direct channel connection over the network. Here is a selected list of state channel solutions:Lightning (Bitcoin) payment channel, live on Bitcoin Mainnet since 2018Raiden (Ethereum) payment channel, not liveTrinity (Neo) payment channel, not liveSpankChain (Ethereum) state channel for payments & smart contracts, live Perun (Ethereum) state channel for payments & smart contracts, not live Counterfactual (Ethereum) state channel for payments & smart contracts, not liveCeler (Blockchain agnostic) roll out in 2019Machinomy (Ethereum) payment channel, liveFunFair (Ethereum) state channel for payments & smart contracts, beta Liquidity (Ethereum) payment channel, liveSidechainsSidechains also allow for the transfer of any state. They are separate blockchains, compatible with the mainchain, linked to the mainchain using a two-way peg. A two-way peg enables interchangeability of assets at a predetermined rate between the mainchain and the sidechain. A user first has to send their tokens from the mainchain to an address, where the tokens become locked so the user is unable to spend them. Once the transaction has been completed, a confirmation is communicated across both networks. After a waiting period, the same number of tokens is released on the sidechain, allowing the user to access and spend them there. The reverse happens when moving back from a sidechain to the mainchain. A group of servers (federation) mediates between a mainchain and its sidechains and determines when the tokens a user has used are locked up and released. This adds another security layer between the mainchain and the sidechain. The federation is selected by the sidechain developers.A sidechain needs to interact with the computation layer on the mainchain and requires tokens to be locked to facilitate disputes. The sidechain doesn\u2019t need to be public; they can be privately managed. One can, therefore, move assets to the sidechain and then back to the mainchain. Sidechains have their own consensus mechanism, and thus their own level of security. Sidechains, therefore, need their own miners, often incentivized through merged mining. This means that two separate tokens, based on the same algorithm, are mined simultaneously. Without enough mining power to secure a sidechain, it could be attacked. If a sidechain is compromised, the damage will be contained within that network and won\u2019t affect the mainchain or other sidechains.As opposed to state channels, transactions on a sidechain are not private. They are published on the sidechain and thus visible to every participant on the sidechain. On the flip side, with sidechains, one does not have to be available all the time, and there are no extra administrative costs in adding or removing participants. However, sidechains need a lot of initial investment. They need to have enough miners so that the network is safe from attackers. Furthermore, the federation adds another layer between the mainchain and the sidechain and could introduce more attack vectors.Such sidechain solutions can operate more efficiently, as some decentralization can be sacrificed for scalability. As the mainchain guarantees overall security and dispute resolution, transactions conducted on a sidechain can sacrifice decentralization in return for scalability. Not everyone needs to agree and validate this consensus; only those directly operating on the sidechain need to be involved. Here is a selected list of sidechain solutions:Plasma (Ethereum), not live Rootstock RSK (Bitcoin Mainnet), not live Alpha Elements (Bitcoin Testnet)POA Network (Ethereum)Hivemind (Bitcoin)Loom (Ethereum) Liquid (Bitcoin)Bitcoin Extended (Bitcoin)MimbleWimble (Bitcoin)Bitcoin Codex (Bitcoin re-design of Namecoin)Blockchain InteroperabilityWhile the number of blockchains and tokens managed on these blockchains and other DLTs are growing at a rapid pace, these distributed ledgers remain isolated. Most blockchains and other DLTs work as a silo. This means that a blockchain has no knowledge of what happens in other blockchains or ledgers. On many networks, capacity might be idle while other networks are clogged with transactions. Sidechains could be seen as the first step toward full blockchain interoperability. Scaling, however, could happen on a much larger scale than with dedicated sidechains, if and when standards like Cosmos, Polkadot, or Wanchain might be operational and adopted.Interoperability in this context refers to the ability to freely share tokens and related data across blockchain systems. In a fully interoperable environment, a user from blockchain A can send another user on blockchain B a token. Blockchain interoperability is a contrary idea to what some propose might happen: a winner-takes-all situation where due to network effects only one Blockchain will survive. The idea of one chain to \u201crule them all\u201d is contrary to the core idea of decentralization. The future of the Web3 might, therefore, depend on the ability of blockchain networks to interact with one another.Interoperability can also enable different blockchains to easily communicate among one another without the need for an intermediary, like a centralized exchange. However, we might be far from being able to make the theory work. It is hard to predict when such interoperability will be feasible.ShardingSome developers propose that sharding could be a solution to the scalability problem of blockchains. Sharding is a concept adopted from distributed databases but has not been tested on a global scale in the context of blockchains. Sharding could address the scalability constraints of current consensus protocols, where each node holds the ledger, maintaining the full history of the state of the blockchain, from the genesis block until the present day. Sharding suggests that the blockchain history could be split into pieces called shards, and each of which would have their own shard of the state. Multiple shards of the blockchain could run parallel to each other, thus improving network scalability. Note that the blockchain as a whole should still operate under one state. Shards would be sub-states as part of the whole state that together form the state of the chain.Addresses, balances, and general state are contained on shards. Shards provide proofs to the mainchain and can communicate with other shards over the sharding protocol. Each shard has to be consistent in itself. Cross-shard communication is handled through protocol rules. The mainchain can coordinate a consistent general state of the network. Sample projects working on sharding solutions: \u201c Prysmatic Labs,\u201d \u201c Drops of Diamond,\u201d \u201c Status,\u201d and \u201c PegaSys.\u201d However, all these solutions are highly experimental.Alternative Cryptographic AlgorithmsOne of the biggest challenges in state-of-the-art blockchains is the management of unspent transactions. These unspent transactions contribute to the exponential growth of the ledger. In Bitcoin, for example, they are referred to as UTXOs and contribute to a higher payload, more expensive transactions, and less throughput per second. When a new raw transaction gets created and later validated, before signing, the inputs can only come from unspent outputs of former transactions. Therefore, for transaction creation validating and signing, unspent transactions are more important than spent transactions (outputs). For the consistency of the ledger, unspent transactions are still of importance for things like time-stamping, proof of existence, data storage, and also block creation and mining.Transaction-oriented blockchain services are all about the unspent transactions. This is why bloat of the ledger is so heavily related to them. Managing the payload-size of the UTXO, the amount of UTXOs on the ledger, and the degree up to which it becomes possible to keep them off-the-chain remedies the bloat of the chain as such. In fact, everything that keeps the payload smaller tackles bloat.Alternative cryptographic algorithms used in collective signatures, like multi-signatures, ring signatures, threshold signatures, or Schnorr signatures, could resolve certain scalability problems; for example, by reducing information added to the ledger, or eliminating that information with multi-signatures, and redeem scripts. With multi-signature transactions, for example, receiver addresses get aggregated into one multisig receiver address and cause the accompanying redeem script to be stored offline. It also reduces the number of outputs and script size inside the transaction. The same is true for ring signatures, threshold signatures, and collective signatures.Multi-signatures are divided into a funding transaction, which turns into a UTXO and a spending transaction and results in a spent transaction. For the UTXO-relevant funding transactions, the aggregation of several receivers into one receiving address and the usage of fewer outputs, plus off-chaining the redeem-script, normally results in a smaller payload. Alternative signature schemes belong to the anti-bloat toolset, definitely, but compared to the average non-multisig transaction, payload reduction is not always the case. It depends on the specific use case. \u201cMimblewimble,\u201d for example, is a proposal for Bitcoin to use a different approach to transaction construction. It removes most historic blockchain data, including spent transaction outputs, while still allowing users to fully verify the chain. It also allows for more privacy than current Bitcoin implementations. \u201cDfinity\u201d and \u201cHyperledger Fabric\u201d use threshold signatures.References & Further ReadingStathakopoulou, C.; Cachin, C.: \u201cThreshold Signatures for Blockchain Systems \u201c, IBM Research, Published in: RZ3910 in 2017: https://domino.research.ibm.com/library/cyberdig.nsf/papers/CA80E201DE9C8A0A852580FA004D412F/$File/rz3910.pdfTual, Stephan: \u201cWhat are State Channels?\u201d, Jan 4, 2017: https://blog.stephantual.com/what-are-state-channels-32a81f7accabVasa: \u201cDifference Between SideChains and State Channels\u201d, Hackernoon, June 26 2018: https://hackernoon.com/difference-between-sidechains-and-state-channels-2f5dfbd10707Vasa: \u201c10 State Channel Projects Every Blockchain Developer Should Know About\u201d, Hackernoon, Jun 25, 2018: https://hackernoon.com/10-state-channel-projects-every-blockchain-developer-should-know-about-293514a516fdAbout the AuthorShermin Voshmgir is the Author of the Book \u201cToken Economy\u201d.

As Yune_Tubi explains, getting paid in BTC would be far more favorable. As such, it seems likely a lot of BAT earners will effectively cash out their tokens for Bitcoin on a regular basis. That situation may come to change in the future, but when it is raised as a potential concern on day one, things might not necessarily look all that great.Hmmm. At first blush, I honestly don\u2019t have a strong opinion either way on this bitcoin-versus-BAT question. (Full disclosure: I own small amounts of both bitcoin and BAT right now.)

Over time, I expect each \u201cedition\u201d to develop its own unique characteristics.

As an agent-centric architecture, it doesn\u2019t need data-centric consensus. It isn\u2019t a monolithic space where bigger apps or communities can control smaller ones. Each hApp is autonomous as its own P2P encrypted network. Holochain is designed for mutual sovereignty between individual and group since each hApp forms a Strong Nash Equilibrium where rules are mutually enforced while maintaining individual autonomy, control, and ownership of your own data. This control never concentrates to another class of user.How does Holo.host avoid that economy of scale which makes some actors become super hosts? Do you have some levers in place to maintain balance?Holo is a hosting company providing hosting services for P2P apps. We do KYC and have contracts with our hosts. Quite simply, we can limit the number of Holo instances that a host can run. If you max out at 5 or 10 instances, you just can\u2019t overturn the market.However, I do expect to see a need emerge for commercial class hosting for some Holo apps (things like YouTube for example). We may have a need for different service classes like Holo Peer and Holo Pro. One lever is to require people who sign a commercial Holo Pro contract to provide 20% of their bandwidth for web relays to Holo Peer hosts. This ensures traffic can reach hosts behind NATs or Firewalls by using public IPs and Ports of the larger hosts, helping keep the system in balance.How can the public audit the system? Not the code base but the usage patterns.Holochain apps and their data are only available to users of those apps. We have no central way to collect data or even know all the apps that exist or are running.However, Holo.host does collect usage pattern data from hosts which is used in the match-making process of connecting app users to hosts serving that app. That process of selecting/routing to a host results a triple-blind randomization with inputs from Holo, the app user, and the app provider.

A card schema defines both the card itself and the card\u2019s relationship with other cards. This definition is used to create a composable user experience and data system that allows cards to move around.At Cardstack, we have been using card schemas as basic building blocks for a long time. We have built applications ourselves and released documentation showing other developers how to leverage schemas and define relationships, in order to build applications that are composable \u2014 not just in a single-application point of view. They can also use components from other applications to build up an app from parts.The traditional card schema (Card Schema V1) divides the problem of defining what a card is (its fields and relationships) from actually encoding that data. This is similar to defining a column for your SQL database and then putting in the values by inserting them into the rows. These have always been two separate concepts. But if you want to create something that can move around, you want to combine them. Excel is very good at this. When you open an Excel file, it contains the computer properties (the definition, the columns, and maybe the formula) as well as the instant data (what\u2019s in the rows underneath, the values you type in).When we talk about databases, especially databases on the Web, it\u2019s very hard to say, \u201cI want to take my data from Google and move it to Facebook.\u201d That\u2019s equally true for, \u201cI want to take my data from Salesforce.com and move it to MailChimp.\u201d You need very specific adapters to bring that together. But what if all the information you enter about your customer or yourself were combined into this thing called a card, which includes both what it is and what the data is? That way, we can facilitate movement across hubs and the whole system.What is a card? (2:31)From a framework, programming, and design point of view, a card is an application at a state. A card is both the app and what you put into the app. That\u2019s quite unique. When you use an application that does a to-do list, you think of your to-do list as the app and then of your entry (what you type into your checklist) as the state or the data. But a card contains both. Think about a Web page; when you open up Twitter, it loads the app and looks at your account, seeing what state or what information about your Twitter account fits into that app, and then renders your tweets.Furthermore, a card has an identity. It has a URL, a link. The goal of making a card a state with an identity (combining services, storage, and references/links) is that the end users perceive the card as a physical thing. It is almost like a screenshot they can move around. And when they want to edit the schema, they can edit it within the application. It\u2019s similar to an Excel file; if you want to have a slightly different formula to predict your revenue, you can go to the app and change the formula by changing the code. Or you can punch in some new information about your sales in July and let the data update itself. So, a card is like a self-contained document, with both the template and the schema included.The environment \u2014 the app you build around cards \u2014 uses the service of the card to say, \u201cyou told me you have an estimate of your revenue or your projection for this quarter; what is it?\u201d Excel can kind of do that; you can link two Excel sheets together and say, \u201ctake the output of sheet three and use it as input for this field.\u201d But the composability starts to break down once you have a couple more sheet libraries and then upload everything to a server \u2014 suddenly, all your links break. On the Web, that\u2019s much more reliable. You know that you can always get the latest information from your bank because you have an API. Since every card is also an API, Cardstack implements the card in a server called the Cardstack Hub. Based on the definition of the card, that hub generates an API that is the same as the APIs you get from Gmail or MailChimp or Intercom. The card\u2019s services are part of that.That\u2019s what a card is. The environment interacts with the card through services, and the card has both its own storage and a link.What is in a card? (5:42)A card includes these three components (app/services, state/storage, identity/link), which contain further components.The app (services) includes templates and schemas:The template could be the map, the booking screen, the checkout screen, or the account screen of your app. In the Cardstack universe, we have both an isolated and an embedded template, as a card can both stand on its own and contain other cards. An embedded template would be like embedding a YouTube video inside a block, where YouTube renders that little self-contained video with the play control on the bottom. When you go to the YouTube link, you get the isolated view, which shows related content, title, description, and comments; that would be the isolator. Every card is like a YouTube video, except that it\u2019s not just a video, but could be about a to-do list, about invoices, about payments, etc. All these things exist in the template.The schema is about data types. For example, an app about dog walkers has all kinds of data \u2014 like the dog walkers, the locations, the cities, the dogs, and the prices. Those schemas make up the application. If your card is a to-do list, it could have \u2018is it done yet?\u2019 data or checkout data or a due date. But if your to-do list ends up marking some sort of business process, you may want to attach it and say, \u201cthis item actually links to whether the credit report has been received, whether the loan has been approved, whether the car has been returned.\u201d That idea of a card containing another card and using another schema is quite powerful.The state (storage) includes field values and references to other cards:The storage contains the field values (what is actually in the field, what is stored as part of the card) as well as references to other cards. For example, if you wrote a song, you would put in the song title and reference your collaborators. You could point to other cards, referencing the artist\u2019s card or the union card if you\u2019re putting together a Broadway show. This is possible because every card has an identity. You can say, \u201cWho played in this song? Let me go to the card, find the union card, copy and paste all of that, and boom\u201d \u2014 that\u2019s how you link your new show or song with another person.So, the card mixes the things we like about the Web (the hyper-linking aspects of it) with the things we like about applications (which allow you to interact with it and have a consistent user interface).Once you have a card, you can place this card in your personal library. It\u2019s almost like saving a file to your personal folder. But you can also take this card (or this set of templates, schemas, fields, relationships, and links) and put it in the shared catalog. Usually, what you have on your computer does not easily become something on a website; you have to upload it, copy and paste in the forms, etc. But with cards, because they\u2019re self-contained, all you have to do is say, \u201cHere\u2019s my card.\u201d That card contains everything; and suddenly, it shows up in the shared catalog. That\u2019s the power of the self-encapsulation of cards.What is in the card schema? (9:10)A schema has two components: There\u2019s the public face of the card and the private implementation of the card. Let\u2019s take an invoice, for example.You want to have information with a lot of details; it could point to certain products you have or include a discount or some notes or some special notes for accounting, etc. Those would be private fields.The public aspects are more obvious; since this is an invoice, it should have a due date, plus information about the payment status, the value, the tax, and maybe some currency details. This basic standard interoperability ensures that, if you receive invoices from ten different organizations, they will look very conform metadata-wise; and even though you may not know the private invoice implementation details, you can still act on that publicly available data very similarly.This is actually what happens on the Web. When you put something on the Web, you have a lot of fields that make up the Web page \u2014 whether it is a boarding pass, flight information, or a product in an e-commerce store. You have some public data that you mark up. Then, Facebook, Google, and search engines look at those public fields, like the public fields of your blog post; they extract the thumbnail image, the title, the description, and the author, and give you a nice little teaser in your news feed. That\u2019s the metadata. It\u2019s something that has an enterprise and backend-system tradition, but is also (through the semantic Web or search engine optimization) meaningful in the Web.That\u2019s what happens in the app. The metadata is like the interface that shields some of the low-level details. And because the schema and the services are all part of the API family, you can actually see the metadata and the fields. If you go to Card Board (our content management system), you can see that an article has certain fields. We are working on making some of those fields metadata, so you can actually syndicate them to Google News, for instance.How does a card compose its content? (11:30)When you compose a card that contains another card, you are doing something called delegated rendering. The easiest example of this is a blog post with a YouTube video. You paste a link to a YouTube video into your blog post, thereby embedding the template from YouTube; in this case, the embedded template is the YouTube player. So, you are rendering your blog post yourself (with your title and your information), but when it comes to this video, you want to delegate the rendering to YouTube and have them compose it. That\u2019s called IFrame (Inline Frame). Ads do this too; if you have a website and you want to make money, you delegate the rendering of a particular portion \u2014 such as the top banner \u2014 to an ad network or ad agent.The first version of Cardstack was actually based on IFrame. But the problem with this technology is that it is extremely inefficient. That\u2019s one of the reasons why a lot of ad-supported websites and publication sites are so slow; it\u2019s because they have all these IFrames and all this JavaScript that\u2019s running within / outside / in between these IFrames. In contrast, when you go to a well-constructed SaaS app, all the templates, cards, and components are actually part of one app. They might get delegated in a certain hierarchy, but at the end of the day, they\u2019re actually part of the same codebase, and therefore, the app doesn\u2019t have that weight.We have been supporting delegated rendering in the Cardstack Framework. In fact, almost all the apps we\u2019ve shipped so far have an embedded template. When you go to Card Folio, the rendering of each crypto asset is delegated. If you go to our Card Board application, the rendering of the media assets and the rich texts that make up the articles are delegated too.But now, we want to introduce a new way of doing this. Sometimes, you don\u2019t actually need to delegate the rendering of your video. A good example is an email attachment. You might just want to know the file name, size, and type \u2014 all of which come from the metadata.Sometimes, the template (the containing card) just needs to list the metadata. If you have an expense report and you drag a receipt into it, that receipt has metadata about when and how and what category; so, you want to be able to sum up all these things in a table \u2014 a rendered list with the metadata for each one of those things. So, in Cardstack, you can either use delegated rendering to build applications or (as the containing application, the invoice, the expense report looking at the receipt) extract the metadata and lay it out in a grid or table of your choice \u2014 whatever makes sense for your user experience in the containing app.What is a card\u2019s facade? (14:21)Cards are very flexible. They can do anything, because they\u2019re essentially just a pile of code with some data in it; they expose metadata and have a template you can render. But as we think about interoperability, we start looking at your ability to get something you expect from a card. What if a card is describing an event \u2014 a conference or a show or a performance from a famous rock band? That event can have certain fields that are expected, such as the door time, duration, and location. If you are an artist and you want to list all your events, all of which may be in different places, you can have differently styled posters on the Web for each of the events. If you click on them, they\u2019re all different, but they can all be listed very coherently within your page template, by leveraging this metadata service.One way to make sure this works all the time is for a card to declare a facade. The card could say, \u201cI\u2019m an event card. I know what Google and Facebook and Eventbrite expect of an event card; these are the common fields that exist in every event. So, I\u2019ll comply with this idea and make metadata that is always consistent (that is part of a standard), to ensure interoperability.\u201dHow do composite cards support facades? (15:53)The first card in the Cardstack Ecosystem that ever says \u201cI\u2019m an event\u201d essentially becomes the template for all the other cards that say, \u201cThat\u2019s a good idea, an event card. I\u2019m going to be an event card too!\u201d And that\u2019s what happens next. If you share your event card to the catalog and other people, who go to the Card Catalog, like your card, they can use your card to make their own event card. Their card may have a different layout, different fields; it may be for a sporting event or not have general admission; or maybe, it has more information about specific sections. It is a new composite card that can combine fields, add fields / sections / segments, but that uses the facade of the event card to map its fields, so that it looks exactly like the event card that\u2019s in the catalog. That\u2019s what we call field mapping.When you save this event card, it can be dragged and added to your upcoming event exactly the same way, because it looks like an event card from the outside. That\u2019s what we call re-implementation, which is the card way of doing this \u2014 you map all the fields, so that it looks exactly like the event card on the outside, while it could be doing anything on the inside. For example, if you have a playlist and you have different shows with different songs, you can calculate how long your show would be, based on the songs you\u2019re playing; so, you can compute the duration (like in Excel), add it up, and that\u2019s how long your show is going to be. You can do that even though the original event card in the catalog doesn\u2019t support it; you can add support for this additional field and then map it as a duration or calculator field.That allows us to innovate and derive from works people have done. Developers starting to build an event system can look at the Card Catalog as a template or as a starting point for their own creations.We are also working on a simpler version of this, called \u201cadopt\u201d. If you like an event card, but you want to use a different style or template, because you want your font to be kind of gothy and dark for a heavy-metal show, you can just take the event card with all its fields, use all the data, and change the template; you can make it look very different using Web development techniques like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while still being able to use all the fields and metadata. So, it would be like using the card wholesale, and just changing the look and feel by scheming or theming it. With this idea, Web developers can come to the Cardstack Ecosystem and do some billable creative work without having to deal with front-end engineering, JavaScript, mapping, etc. But if you\u2019re a developer and you want to make your card compatible with other things, you can use this re-implementation.Can a card have multiple facades? (18:51)You can create a card with multiple facades. Let\u2019s say you create a card that is a ticket. The ticket is more than just an event, because it also includes payment. You want to make sure everybody has paid for the event and you want to give them a receipt. There\u2019s a receipt in the Card Catalog, there\u2019s an event in the Card Catalog, and there are different payment forms in the Card Catalog. So, when you create that ticket, it is simultaneously a ticket card, a receipt card, and an event card. And you can drag the event into an event calendar or drag the receipt into an expense report system, which will recognize the value, how much you paid, and add it up.So, even though the card looks just like a ticket to the user, it is actually much more. You can scan a QR code at the door, have the event show up in your calendar, use the payment as proof that you have paid, and take the receipt so you can get reimbursed for it. And then, based on what you think your card is more like \u2014 is it more like a ticket, kind of a receipt, less like an event? \u2014 that actually helps us to decide which one you prefer, when you drag the card into something that expects multiple types.Therein lies much of our inspiration for designing Cardstack. When you copy something from Excel and paste it into Word, Word says, \u201cI know what you\u2019re doing. You\u2019re pasting a spreadsheet, so I\u2019m going to preserve the formula.\u201d If you paste it in an email, it may be an image; if you paste it into Notepad, it ends up as a list of names in plain text. So, the idea of being able to use this facade is about saying, \u201cWhat are you? Can we use the maximum value you provide within the card, so that we can reduce the amount of degradation as you move a card, copy a card, or paste a card from one system to another?\u201d As you compose your card-based experience, this entire idea of weighted facades is really important.To do multiple facades, you have to be a developer who understands how to map the fields, who knows which fields are required, and who can run tests to make sure those fields are implemented correctly, with the right data type (we\u2019re building tools that make this very easy, using the Cardstack Framework). Most users will just say, \u201cGreat! There\u2019s a ticket. Let me go modify the ticket and call the event something else.\u201d This template becomes something where people can just change the data, to make meet-up tickets \u2014 which do the same thing and have all these great capabilities \u2014 for their own events. But the developer building this for the first time will have to wire this up and create the facades.How do we deal with new versions of card schemas? (21:42)Tickets and things like that are stored in your personal library, much like old files (old decks, old PowerPoints, old code, \u2026). But they may go out of date. They may require a new version of Photoshop, or the old version that is no longer on the market. That\u2019s why version control is a big problem. If you try to upload something to a Web service that\u2019s based on the old version, or you\u2019re uploading a file format that\u2019s not supported, it may ask you to update it.But since Cardstack has a Card Catalog, which is built as a card registry, we can say, \u201cSince you adopted the event card v1 two years ago, let\u2019s see if the event card author (the person who wrote that event card) has a translator; maybe, they upgraded to v2, and this second version includes a mapping route. So, if you ever encounter a card that has the facade of event card 1.0, you\u2019re in luck.\u201d If the catalog contains code published by the author of that event card, that author is acting like an open-source maintainer, who wants to make sure that all the people who have used the event card \u2014 either as is or adopting it \u2014 have the ability to leverage those mapping routes. And that\u2019s how you allow a new card that\u2019s expecting this new format to get translated. The old ticket card from two years ago will continue to work as long as it maps to these well-maintained cards. We want to make sure that these common cards people derive their own cards from are maintained. And that is something we encourage open-source developers (especially front-end developers with skills in and an understanding of JavaScript) to do \u2014 to make these different types of cards and create the basic interoperating infrastructure, while also (much like a well-maintained open-source project) building migration tools. This ensures that, when people have old cards that are using an old version, there\u2019s an easy way to use the shared catalog to translate the card.Migration is also very important for those who have done database work, especially MongoDB and NoSQL work. What Cardstack is doing in storing the serialization of the data within the card is very similar to how document databases do things. In document databases, instead of splitting your invoice into three tables (invoice, details, payee, payment), you put them all in one JSON document and store it as is. And if you add a field, you have to migrate the data; so, the migration script has to exist.Because cards are compositional, you can migrate the part that is related to events or tickets separately, assuming you\u2019re adopting it in a certain way. If you\u2019re deriving and re-implementing it, then you have to take responsibility for upgrading to a certain version. But there are nice things about leveraging this migration. It shows up in searches, and if you have a new field that gets calculated (let\u2019s say the duration of an event card was just a calculation between start time and end time, and now it is its own field), then, for those cards that do not have the duration field, you can go and calculate that and use that as a migration script. That\u2019s how new versions get handled.When does a card snapshot its contained cards? (25:11)The version of the card is important. But the version of the data is equally important. We have lived through the world where you go to a brand-new website, get on a product hunt, find the product, and start using the to-do-list application. It\u2019s great, so you put all your data \u2014 your state \u2014 inside that database, using the template and the UI they provide. Then, one day, they go out of business or they get bought by Facebook and all the data is gone. So, when you send someone a link with your to-do list or your membership information, suddenly, that link doesn\u2019t work anymore, because it\u2019s broken.That is why we wanted to make sure we can make cards much more resilient to these kinds of version-related issues. In some cases, a version is only available on a website or on a hosted server and suddenly, that host is not available anymore. So, we do something called snapshots. A snapshot is not all that different from taking a screenshot of a boarding pass, in case it disappears from the app or the flight gets canceled and you want to be able to prove that you have a boarding pass. For your own sake, you make a copy, storing the information in a screenshot or PDF. With the card infrastructure and the idea of app + state + link (all of them being one thing), we can make a copy of this state.Say you\u2019re making a ticket card, which goes through an API to access the Google Calendar API. This Google Calendar API tells you that the event is on the 26th. Then, you update the UI; but while doing that, you store a copy of your data within the card, saying, \u201cHey card, in case you forget, here is the value of the thing I saw on Google Calendar. It gave me the response that the event is at 7:00 p.m. on the 26th, so please write that down.\u201d It\u2019s the same with payments. You might be using a Stripe API; when you\u2019ve paid, you can take all the data and write it in the card. So, in the future, if the link between the live data and the card got severed, your card would render the last known information that it saved for you. That\u2019s essentially what snapshots are good for \u2014 they are good for resiliency.But it gets even more interesting. It\u2019s not just about data not being available because, for example, your Google Calendar authorization is gone. It\u2019s for sharing. If you are sharing data with another person by selling them a ticket, and it all depends on you having access to the Google API or your Google account, then there\u2019s no guarantee. The other person may not have access to the underlying official API data from Google. Even if you can access that API, the other person may not be able to see the data.This idea of being able to exchange cards as if they were actual documents / screenshots / printed documents requires us to save that information in a way that allows the card to be mobile. Every single time something goes from a library to the catalog, we capture this information. Now, if someone is trying to make a new event card, and realizes, \u201coh they support Google Calendar, that\u2019s great, so I can have it updated bidirectionally on my calendar,\u201d the person has to reestablish the link. Then, this would be a new event in October. And that linkage is quite useful for other people using this ticket template for their own workflows. But in this particular example of an event card that is published as a template in the public catalog, the card contains some static data of same sample event. If you have it on your computer and you want to see the live data \u2014 whether it has been updated, the date has been changed, the event was canceled, your credit card was charged \u2014 you want to be able to switch between the snapshots and the live data, if you are privileged to see the sources. Even if you don\u2019t, it\u2019s good for that to be there.This over-the-wire response \u2014 what has been sent back from the payment card \u2014 is entirely within the card and therefore entirely within the Cardstack environment. So, it\u2019s quite easy for us to take what has been returned to the hub, insert it in the browser, and write that to this series of snapshots. You can actually go back and forth on the snapshot history and see how this event has evolved; assuming that it was rescheduled several times, you can actually have a button to see what\u2019s going on.We haven\u2019t mentioned any more sophisticated data sources than APIs like Stripe or Google Calendar. But the truth is that a lot of what we talk about at Cardstack \u2014 about cryptocurrency or blockchain \u2014 fits really nicely with this model.When you want to pay someone in cryptocurrency, that requires you to have a MetaMask plugin that gets the data. If you share the link and the other person doesn\u2019t have your wallet or address, that information disappears, because the linkage (the over-the-wire, the access to the data source) doesn\u2019t exist, it\u2019s severed. Using the same snapshot mechanism we can use for Web APIs / Web 3.0 APIs / crypto APIs / blockchain-based APIs, we can create the same resiliency with a much newer, much more advanced, and much more cutting-edge technology, thus providing safety and dependability. That\u2019s what is currently lacking in the user experience of a blockchain-based application: It\u2019s really hard to get it to work for one person. Imagine what happens when we invite more participants and build network effects. With snapshots, you can say, \u201cThere\u2019s a shadow of this data. If you can connect it to your wallet, I will pay you a commission.\u201d Then there\u2019s incentive to say, \u201cHey, this application works. There\u2019s a hidden treasure here if you unpack this paid-by-ETH bonus system. And once you connect it back over the wire, you get another button in your template that allows you to redeem your rewards.\u201d Snapshots are the way to make this happen.How do you copy or move a card to a new hub? (31:18)Ultimately, the point of snapshots and this encapsulation of data and code is to do something relatively simple: We want to create this idea that cards are completely mobile. So, your ticket card \u2014 which contains its own template, its own look and feel, the fields, the linkages to Google Calendar, the payment, the snapshot data, and the link \u2014 is just one JSON file. All of this is just one data structure, much like everything in your financial model is just one XLS file. That one thing is the code + the data + the value, and it exists in your library. You can also submit or share it. Say you bought a ticket that you put on your home page, which runs Cardstack, and you want to gift it to a local NGO, because it\u2019s a nonprofit that gives underprivileged kids access to this amazing concert. You can send them your ticket through a workflow system or just by copy- and pasting the URL. But that URL (unlike a YouTube video) is actually pulling all the information \u2014 including the ticket, payment, transfer, and maybe even blockchain records of who owns the ticket \u2014 and giving it to this new shared workspace.This is not about installing or uninstalling apps, or making sure that versions are compatible (Is it the same WordPress? Do you have an Airtable account?) None of that matters anymore. Is your Airtable aligned with my fields? Of course not, because the schema and the data are separate; they are different between the tenants in a multi-tenant system. But Cardstack completely encapsulates it, so that you don\u2019t have to worry about tenancy anymore. Every workspace, every library, every site, every network, every registry, every consortium is just a folder that contains these cards. A card contains its own data. And if you want to compose it, the cards provide the APIs and service to each other. Most importantly, the Cardstack Framework does all the hard work. All the things we talked about, all the layers of architecture, all the tools and APIs we\u2019ve built \u2014 all of this is about creating the illusion that a card is a physical thing you can exchange with the people you like. And when you exchange it, the card goes where you want it to go, including all things necessary. To render it, to link it, to see it, to reliably render it even if you don\u2019t have the permission \u2014 all that exists within this promise that is provided by the card stack.Status & strategy (33:47)1. Current open-sourced projects are on Card Schema V1 and will continue to work: Card Board, Card Folio, Tally, dotBC Music Registry, Card SDK Project TemplateAs we embark on the upgrade of this framework, we acknowledge that we have a lot of current open-source projects that are on the first version of schema (Card Schema V1). There\u2019s usually a Git repository with the definition of the file, and then another one that is appended with \u201c-data\u201d \u2014 this one has all the data, such as content for articles and images for Card Board; cryptocurrency addresses for Card Folio; prepaid-card accounts, service providers, and billing relationships for Tally; music recordings, albums, and artist release schedules for the dotBC music registry. We are also creating a much simpler Card SDK project template for new developers who want to learn about Cardstack. They can see how card schemas work and get this idea of encapsulation. But these are two separate kinds of repository.2. Future projects will use Card Schema V2 to support use cases that require multi-party, multi-hub, and multi-version workflows: Card Space, Card Flow, Card Catalog, Multi-Git RegistryGoing forward, we will continue working on Card Schema V2, until we can release and start using it. We see a lot of use cases where multiple parties need to work together, exchanging data. So, if someone says, \u201chere\u2019s a new license request; if you fill it out, you\u2019ll be able to get this blockchain license of my song or movie,\u201d that means we have to encode the form to apply for the license, the legal language, the version history of negotiating the terms, as well as the payments (which can be done in cryptocurrency or the traditional way). All of that requires the card V2 encapsulation of app + state + link.We also see a world where, instead of having Card Board as your blog, you have a multi-hub federated network, where you can exchange articles and syndicate between communities. If someone creates a new article type, which includes a card that could be some data-flow-diagram-based visualization, that card has its own template, its own logic, and you can install it. The hub brings in those schemas and dependencies, with the Card Catalog providing protection. It acts almost as a registry, which uses some additional cryptographic or other type of moderation technique to make sure that the catalog you can depend on (that allows you to share and move across card boundaries) is safe, similar to chrome plugins that you can install in your browser. And that\u2019s what we call Multi-Git repository. The catalog itself is a Git repository containing cards that are submitted and version-controlled by the community or by sellers of premium ticket templates. Card Flow is the way we move it all. And Card Space is how you accumulate and build your own personal library.As we work on this, the basic structure of a card is not going to change. But the way we encode it, the way we allow these cards to be stitched together through Card Schema V2 allows us to accomplish a really flexible multi-party workflow that will be the foundation of the decentralized way of working, of sharing information, and of conducting business transactions that get you paid and create economic value. So, while Card Schema V1 and V2 will coexist, future Cardstack products will use Card Schema V2 to enable multi-party workflows.3. Create more with less code \u2014 user interface to compose the complete card (schema + templates + data) using only a browser: Leverages the four edges of the Cardstack environment to point and click to a Cardstack appCard Schema V1 supports some sort of light editing. If you define your schema, we give you editing tools (the right edge) that show you all the fields inside that particular schema and allow you to edit them, even if you don\u2019t provide your own editing template; you just click on something and we give you the field editor for that. Yet, one important design goal for Card Schema V2 is to let people add a field. Imagine you download an article template and it\u2019s missing one field that allows you to make a corporate blog; you want to be able to add that one field. And because the definition of the card (the article card or your derivation / adoption of that card) is just a JSON file, it is easy for us to create a user interface that allows people to create schemas. This is similar to adding a column in Excel or a new field in Airtable. Those types of user interface (what we call the Four Edges in the Cardstack environment) provide the tools for power users to not only look at a website, but zoom out a little bit and see the tool palette, so they can change the look, the layout, and maybe the template or the structure. They could add a field and decide whether or not they want to accept cryptocurrency as payment. These are all configurable. Some of them will actually change the schema, not just the data. And to the degree that makes sense, we want Web developers who know HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript to say, \u201cI want to make this ticket or this event or this invoice or this presentation look a little better. Let me go into the little coding panel (like what you see in CodePen), start making modifications to the markup, and have the card reflect the latest changes.\u201d That\u2019s the type of foundation we are building.One of the major projects that will enable this is Embroider. Our lead developer Ed Faulkner has been working with the Ember community as well as the Cardstack team to build a new build system, which leverages Webpack and connects to the Ember ecosystem \u2014 a big part of our framework is on top of the Ember stack \u2014 so as to enable much more dynamic loading of new components. Those new components could be new controls for you to edit fields; for example, if your need a fancy date range editor. But the entire card itself \u2014 this invoice card or podcast card \u2014 is actually just another module; in JavaScript terms, every single card and every single field inside every single card is an NPM module, which we can install in real time as the user encounters it. Say you receive a new licensing request; that\u2019s when your application loads or auto-imports the necessary code to render the template, giving you a drop-down control or letting you select how many impressions you want to get, and changing your licensing price based on that limit.So, creating more with less is about providing the tools to allow many more people to create, iterate, and share in this card-based economy. We want to break out of these apps on our phones that we both love and hate. Only iOS developers and Android developers can craft these perfect nuggets of scrumptiousness. But in fact, these apps are little prisons of our data that don\u2019t want to interact with each other. The card vision, which is based on the World-Wide-Web vision (that\u2019s why we call ourselves the application site for Web 3.0), is about recombining these pieces that are now locked into apps with branded icons on your home screen, and letting them flow a lot more fluently. This way, it\u2019s all in your workflow within your space, shared in the catalog. And we use open-source tools like Git and blockchain to share that between different people.We have been trying to rethink what a document-driven, a unit-of-exchange-driven economy on the Web is going to look like. We will get closer and closer to realizing this vision. Card Schema V1 gave us most of the plumbing for indexing, display, rendering, login, logout, and search. And now, we want to make it one level better, so that the new encapsulation actually makes a federated, decentralized Web a reality \u2014 not just in theory, but in the same scrumptious, amazing user-interface-quality you expect from an app that you subscribe to today.Learn MoreTally Launches on Testnet: Try Cardstack\u2019s metering and billing network for decentralized SaaSIntroducing Gitchain: Cardstack\u2019s Protocol for Syncing Application StatesBuilding the Card Catalog: Status update & strategy for the Card SDKCardstack.comStar Cardstack on GitHub and join our Discord channel or our Telegram group and announcement channel to get all our latest updates.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Web Development", "Blockchain", "Web3", "Schema", "Cardstack"]}, {"title": "NKN Bi-weekly Report July 16-July 29, 2019", "post_link": "https://medium.com/nknetwork/nkn-bi-weekly-report-july-16-july-29-2019-4de729bb569d?source=search_post", "author_name": "NKN", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@NKN_ORG", "publish_date": "2019-08-01", "last_modified_date": "2019-08-01", "readtime": "5.33", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "NKN Bi-weekly Report July 16-July 29, 2019NKNFollowAug 1 \u00b7 6 min readHighlightsTaxa partnership adds trusted compute (TEE)Ankr partnership for decentralized web3.0D-Chat Chrome and FireFox extensions availableMining Reward FairnessNew Kind of Proposal (NKP) UpdatesNew Multi-Client SDKTestnet Future PlansNKN-IoTeX IoTalk winners announcedCommunity: nknX \u201cFast Deploy\u201d on Raspberry Pi 3Mainnet technical development updatesLatest Stats July 29th, 2019:\ud83c\udf10 49 countries\ud83c\udfed 295 ISPs or cloud providers\ud83d\udcbb 24,449 full consensus nodes\ud83d\udcc0 1 minor revisions to fix bugsNKN mainnet code development progress over the last two weeks is mainly reflected in nkn, nnet, nkn-wallet-js, nkn-client-js, nkn-sdk-go, nkn-crawler, web-ui, and nkn-cloud-image repositories and different branches.Pull Request: 15Commits: 41The latest stable release for mainnet is v1.0.4-beta.(https://github.com/nknorg/nkn/releases )NKN Mainnet v1.04betaIncrease measured RTT if ping msg timeout: This will avoid packets being routed to recently timeout neighborUpdate lastRxTime only when receiving ping message: This may fix the case when remote node has extremely slow upstream bandwidth and all message timeout, but it still stays in other nodes\u2019 neighbors.ToRemoteNodeList only returns remote nodes that are not stoppedTaxa partnership adds trusted computeOn July 29th, NKN announced a new partnership with Taxa, which brings together NKN\u2019s decentralized network and Taxa\u2019s trusted compute (TEE) to enable a new breed of high-performance, trustless applications and services.

Woot!For purposes of my interest in Web 3.0 (and this blog), this change of scenery should be awesome, as the Big Apple has turned into a major hub of blockchain innovation the last few years.

Please do reach out anytime via LinkedIn or email peter[at]indizr.com.Speaking of client work, I\u2019m looking forward to the publication soon of a whitepaper I co-authored on behalf of the blockchain startup Dispatch, in partnership with the World Economic Forum and fellow startup Truckl.

Dr. Ro and I have been away since 2014, when we left for the Bay Area. At the time, I\u2019d landed a nice consulting gig there and was working on a startup with a co-founder based there.

McKayFollowJul 3 \u00b7 3 min readPhoto by Glen Carrie via Unsplash.Like a lot of blockchain afficionados, I watched the recent announcement of Facebook\u2019s Libra project with mixed emotions. On the plus side, it should bring needed attention and credibility for blockchain among the masses, expanding the technology\u2019s appeal in ways that may benefit the whole industry. On the other hand\u2026. there\u2019s Facebook. Home of rampant disrespect of user privacy, possible antitrust violations, and general executive cluelessness.After reading the Libra documentation more closely, especially the official project whitepaper, I can honestly say Facebook\u2019s poor track record in these areas isn\u2019t my biggest concern about Libra now. They actually seem to have dealt with the most obvious issues around their involvement in Libra quite elegantly \u2014 by engineering themselves out of the project.Thanks to the open-source licensing of Libra\u2019s technology, the independent foundation that will manage governance issues for the token, and the consortium of several dozen partners (hopefully growing to 100 by the time of Libra\u2019s full public launch), Facebook seems to be setting up a legitimately hands-off stance to Libra over time. If everything goes as planned here, including potential involvement by outside exchanges and wallet developers, it should eventually be possible to buy and sell Libra without any involvement by Facebook whatsoever. (Which is great by me, as that\u2019s the only way I\u2019d ever participate in Libra.)What\u2019s still not as clear to me even after reading the whitepaper is why I\u2019d want to own Libra. The sheer economics of it, the structural features that will truly differentiate Libra from Bitcoin or Ethereum or dozens of other tokens as a currency, still seem at best fuzzy, perhaps even ill-conceived in some respects.To function better as a true means of everyday transactions, not as a speculative vehicle like most cryptocurrencies at present, Libra is structured as a \u201cstablecoin\u201d whose value will fluctuate relatively little day-to-day. There are several such coins out there already, but unlike most of them, Libra doesn\u2019t \u201cpeg\u201d to a single asset like the U.S. dollar or gold.Instead, Libra will be backed by a basket of supposedly low-risk assets managed by the Libra consortium. Why this approach is better remains unclear to me even after reading the whitepaper and a separate page that deals specifically with the reserve issue.The basket approach also strikes me as perhaps needlessly complex, especially if the target market is average Joes and Janes. Why not just simply peg to the dollar, which would be easier for the layman to understand, and get on with it? But, hey, it could work in theory.In any case, it\u2019s probably a mistake to think constructing the right basket is easy. On the Financial Times\u2019 Alphavile blog, Colby Smith and Izabella Kaminska have done a nice job comparing Libra\u2019s reserve idea to other basket type approaches that have been taken elsewhere in the financial world, notably with the International Monetary Fund\u2019s Special Drawing Right system. They also touch on the \u201cbreaking the buck\u201d problem the U.S. had back when the dollar was on the gold standard.I won\u2019t belabor those comparisons here, although I\u2019d certainly recommend reading the excellent FT analysis if you\u2019re interested in the nitty-gritty. (Note, Alphaville requires a free registration to read articles.) Let it suffice for now that (a) properly managing a basket-based means of exchange over time is no small task. And (b) there are some historical examples in traditional finance that might be instructive for Libra.Here\u2019s hoping Facebook and its partners do indeed heed those lessons from here. To do so, they\u2019ll have to steer clear of the main sin that\u2019s plagued the company in other areas: hubris.Thanks for spending some time with Indizr today.

Prior to NKN, if a sender client (a mobile app, for example) wants to send some data to a receiver client, the receiver needs to be publicly accessible, which is not practical for consumer applications, or they have to be both connected to some centralized server/platform, which will introduce additional cost (to build a relay service or pay for the service) and security vulnerability (data exposed to centralized server or 3rd party service). But now with NKN client, both sender and receiver and stay private in any network condition, and they don\u2019t need any centralized server or platform. The data will be routed and delivered in a purely decentralized way, end to end encrypted, and free. This is made possible thanks to the NKN public blockchain.NKN client uses a very simple protocol similar to UDP: each packet only contains information about src, dest, payload, and some other necessary information related to signature chain. A bare minimal NKN client does not create or manage session/stream, and does not guarantee packet ordering, ACK or re-transmission. The bare minimal protocol works well for some applications, e.g. messaging, real time gaming. However, if someone wants to transmit large files using NKN client, a few other problems needs to be solved: boosting throughput, packet ordering and re-transmission, etc. That might sound familiar to you since it\u2019s basically what TCP does.There are more than one ways to achieve the above goals and the best one depends on the application. As a starting point, we created nkn-file-transfer, a simple application/library based on NKN client that can fast and securely send and receive files between peers without any centralized servers. It is written in Golang and uses nkn-sdk-go, multiple concurrent clients similar to nkn-multiclient-js, and simple TCP-like flow control.NKN-file-transfer has 4 modes: send, receive, get, host. Send mode should be paired with receive mode to send file to remote peer, while get mode should be paired with host mode to fetch file from remote peer. Under the hood, both sender and receiver creates multiple clients by adding certain prefix string to the identifier part of NKN address. When a file is being sent, it is first cut into many small chunks (each chunk is 1024 bytes by default) and each chunk is labeled by a sequence number. Then sender sends chunks concurrently using different path and waits for ACK of each chunk from receiver. Only a certain buffer size of unacknowledged chunks may be sent at any time (sliding window). If a chunk is not acknowledged after a timeout, it will be resent using a different path. On the receiver side, when he receives a chunk, he will send an ACK of that chunk back to the sender.Combining these modes, nkn-file-transfer can be turned into a few quite useful applications:Using send/receive mode, you can send a large or sensitive file to someone on the other side of the planet for free. The speed is quite descent, and content is end to end encrypted, without any other people being able to see the actual content of the file, and everything is decentralized.Using get + send mode on one side (say A) while receive + host mode on the other (say B), A can get file from B or put file to B, just like a standard file server.There is also a HTTP mode that can be enabled together with host and receive mode. It can accept HTTP GET/PUT/HEAD request with route remoteAddr/fileName. It accepts HTTP GET request with Range header so browser can stream video while downloading (the latency is high as you may have expected, but the throughput should be good enough).It can be used as a Golang library in other applications.With nkn-file-transfer, you can often get close to 10mbps speed to long range global destinations. We have tested the throughput of nkn-file-transfer by sending a 32MB file from our US office (California) to China office (Beijing) and compared it with WeChat and QQ, two of China\u2019s largest IM that supports file transfer. The throughput of nkn-file-transfer is 460% of WeChat (which uses a centralized server to store file) and 160% of QQ (which uses a centralized server to relay data but not storing file).Our nkn-file-transfer is open sourced at https://github.com/nknorg/nkn-file-transfer. We should address that, it is using a simple flow control algorithm to show how to use NKN client to create high throughput decentralized applications.

Since their inception, many have turned to each of these Internet platforms as much as they turn to their light switches, public transport, and other utilities. Fortunately, an alternative technology is emerging to upset this narrative.Facebook Is Not A UtilityIt goes without saying that the Facebooks of the world are incredibly valuable. Not only do they help families, businesses and other communities stay in contact all over the world, they have also unveiled novel social interactions. What needed a letter sent in the post a hundred years ago, a telephone call thirty years ago now may only need a click of the \u201clike\u201d button. The convenience is outstanding, and it\u2019s important that we don\u2019t forget this; this is the new standard. Anything that falls short of this, will never be taken seriously.The other side of this realization also comes with a host of new ethical considerations, however.Likely the biggest story from 2018 was the Cambridge Analytica scandal in which Facebook was used as a \u201cpsychological warfare tool\u201d to sway massive swaths of Internet communities during the 2016 presidential election in the United States. Even before this watershed moment, The Guardian reported that the British firm was also working for Ted Cruz in 2015.On the one hand, Facebook has become so essential to our lives that parting with Zuckerberg\u2019s creation takes incredible resourcefulness. On the other, the Silicon Valley-based company is now being leveraged for much greater ends than wishing your friends a happy birthday. What\u2019s more, the Facebook founder was the very first person to ever experiment with such leaks.And while Facebook has promised to fight against politically-motivated user manipulation, many have already left the platform due to this initial breach of trust. With this informal contract broken, and populations becoming more and more aware of the value of their data, Zuckerberg has an uphill battle ahead of him.Defining Trust: Oil And DataEstablishing trust between users and a service is fundamental business practice. We trust plumbers, technicians, and tradespeople to apply their expertise to the best of their ability in order to resolve relevant problems.In the case of Facebook, the first people to use the service trusted that the information they were giving would merely allow them to connect with different students at Harvard. Ultimately, regardless if digital or otherwise, we trust that the information we are providing won\u2019t be used against us to surveil our every move or to manipulate the outcome of a critical election.We also trust that this information will be guarded against malicious parties and that the sensitivity of this data will be taken seriously. Trust, these days, means that although we use Facebook to send our good wishes to a colleague, this information is near impossible to access for anyone except for us and our colleagues. Rarely is this the case, however.Consider the Yahoo breach that began in 2013. Early estimates indicated that 500 million users had had their names, addresses, telephone numbers, and dates of birth all compromised. Revised estimates in 2017 determined that the breach had actually affected all three billion user accounts and the data included security questions and even more granular data on users.Trust, in the common era, is the new oil. Facebook, Google, and Amazon are all technically free to use, but what many still don\u2019t realize is that trust is actually a multi-billion dollar industry. All three platforms sell this trust to the highest bidder in the form of highly-specific advertisements.For advertisers, Facebook is a goldmine, as the sheer amount of underlying data enables much more precise targeting than any other marketing channel. This leads to better targeting with less scatter loss. And, in theory, even users profit from this, as only relevant advertisements, catering towards users\u2019 interests are shown to them.While this may achieve a perfectly curated Internet experience, the value capture is in the hands of a few. Not only that, but this small oligarchy are notoriously susceptible to security breaches.Google\u2019s advertising revenue from 2001 to 2018 in billions of US dollars. (Source: Statista)The Promise Of BlockchainBitcoin helped make blockchain technology one of the biggest buzzwords in IT circles all over the world. As the magic Internet money touched $20,000 at the end of 2017, financiers, supply chain outfits, and art collectors began learning more about the infrastructure underpinning the pioneer cryptocurrency.To be clear, digital value transfer is still blockchain technology\u2019s best use case. There is no doubting that the ability to send $62 million for only $4.50 is incredibly powerful. On the periphery of this, however, are the seedlings of a more ethical and open Internet experience.(Source: Twitter)Imagine that, like Bitcoin, you are your own Facebook, Google or Amazon. You are in complete control of your online identity, what data you want to share, and are paid each time a third-party service uses your data. This is the promise of blockchain technology; it hopes to break up the \u201cplatformication\u201d of the Internet and put power back in the hands of users, not corporations. In a peer-to-peer blockchain environment, the individual is always the owner of its own data, not a corporation. Taking an element of trust, as in trusting a company to handle your private data with care, out of the equation, thus, enables a \u201ctrustless\u201d environment.However, we\u2019re only at the beginning of this evolution. To get a better idea of how crypto pioneers are building out a Web 3.0, read about the power of community (not companies), decentralizing the firm (with a DAO), and creating a narrative around transparency for the next generation of the Internet at our blog.Can Blockchain Technology Create A Trustless Internet Experience? was originally published on ufostart.comPlease share this article on Twitter if you got value from it.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Facebook", "Web3"]}, {"title": "QuikNode at ETHIndia Hackathon", "post_link": "https://medium.com/quiknode/quiknode-at-ethindia-hackathon-1ce6cff6c882?source=search_post", "author_name": "Gaurav Agrawal", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@gaurav.agrawal", "publish_date": "2019-08-09", "last_modified_date": "2019-08-09", "readtime": "2.67", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "QuikNode at ETHIndia HackathonRecap & Highlights of ETHIndia 2019 \ud83d\ude80Gaurav AgrawalFollowAug 9 \u00b7 3 min readLast week, QuikNode attended ETHIndia 2019 as an event sponsor! We encountered a vibrant Ethereum community, building a variety interesting projects. Around ~1900 candidates registered, of which around ~68% were new to the Ethereum ecosystem. This tells us that Ethereum is attracting new developers \u2014 fantastic!QuikNode\u2019s WorkshopWe got the chance to present QuikNode and how developers can use it to build cool new projects. We demonstrated how one can build a simple Ethereum Block Explorer using QuikNode and web3.js. Check our talk \ud83d\udc47Here comes VitalikWe also had a chance to listen to Vitalik via live video steam. He talked about Ethereum\u2019s scalability and also answered questions from the audience. Check it out \ud83d\udc47 if you missed it!Exciting projects and winnersWe interacted with almost all the teams and there were many promising projects. Candidates were building all sorts of dApps from DeFi (decentralized finance), to Wallet and privacy solutions. 61 teams submitted their projects\u2026 among them were projects which reached the final round and won prizes (see below).ETHIndia 2019 Winning TeamsDost.network: This team built a privacy-preserving burner wallet using ring signatures. They used an encrypted savings account protect by a PIN, which is connected to a Smart Contract (your wallet with ETH). So when you top up the burner wallet, your ETH passes through a ring mixer and gets withdrawn to your burner wallet savings account. This way you don\u2019t need to reveal how much ETH you have while using the Burner wallet. Here is the full demo:Lendz: This team built privacy-preserving loans using zero-knowledge with Aztec-protocol and Lendroid project. The main idea was to provide lending with privacy. They performed protocol-level changes to Lendriod\u2019s Smart Contract in order to integrate zero-knowledge. Check out the full demo \ud83d\udc471lend.io- This team built a Crypto lending aggregator. With 1lend you can earn interest by lending your tokens across the different lending protocols such as Compound or Dharma. So cool for #DeFi! Check full demo \ud83d\udc47Tessa: This team built a decentralized torrent search engine using Torus and IPFS Orbit DB. Using Tessa, anyone can submit a torrent with a magnet link which will be stored in IPFS\u2019s orbit DB, and can be searched easily. The search engine uses decentralized infrastructure, so it can\u2019t be taken down. Check out their demo. \ud83d\udc47Credeth: This team built an open reputation protocol. They tried to mimic how the current credit score works by providing multiple options to build a reputation. For example, if you own an ENS domain, you will earn some reputation; if you lend some Ether on a lending protocol or create a CDP, you will earn some reputation. Check out the demo:NuAztec: This team built selective-ZKP (zero-knowledge proofs) access-control lists using NuCypher and Aztec. The idea is to authorize access to a zero-knowledge system to selective people using view keys. You can check out the full demo.ConclusionIn addition to the above projects, there were many projects with superb ideas. We interacted with a lot of new developers, projects and sponsors. We were amazed to see how Ethereum community attracts developers in India, even after a regulatory crackdown. Developers are the real moat of the Ethereum ecosystem. Any other project in blockchain space will have a really tough time replicating such a diverse, inclusive, enthusiastic community!QuikNode loves #web3 developers \u2014 so if you are building something cool around Ethereum, let us know on Twitter (we\u2019ll shout you out)!Some MemoriesAbout QuikNodeQuikNode.io is building infrastructure to support the future of Web3.

It was great to be able to see old friends and collaborators and also meet people who have never heard of Witnet or had not thought of the issues surrounding data oracles before. We found pretty much all of our conversations about what we\u2019re working to solve and how we\u2019re going about it to to be both enlightening and incredibly validating.Web3 SummitOur first stop was Berlin and the Web3 Summit. It was a great experience full of rich talks, learning, and discussing the best approach to the Oracle problem with other colleagues. We also got to participate in a cool interview with Griff from Giveth!Status HackathonAfter that, we headed to Prague where we first participated as sponsors in the Status #cryptolife hackathon, a great event where we got to meet smart contract developers from all over the world and participate in meaningful conversations.D1ConfNext, we headed to D1Conf, which we were fortunate enough to be able to sponsor. This was the decentralized insurance conference where Ad\u00e1n was able to deliver his #DontTrustTheMessenger talk: why smart contracts shouldn\u2019t trust centralized data providers.Adan also participated in an Oracle panel with other members of the community working on different approaches to solving the Oracle problem. It was a lively discussion that really hooked the audience. We were grateful to be part of one of the highlights of the whole event.Finally, in this video interview, you can watch Ad\u00e1n explain the core of Witnet\u2019s design and how our technology works on empowering smart contracts.Devcon IVDevCon IV was the climax of Prague Blockchain Week and largely the pinnacle of the Fall event lineup this year. Over the course of several days, non-stop talks, workshops and immersive experiences were offered to an enthusiastic group of individuals from all over the world who were waiting with anticipation to share and hear updates on their favorite projects and initiatives. We were encouraged by seeing talks about the very problems we are trying to solve related to data oracles, including a packed talk given by Chainlink\u2019s Sergey Nazarov.For sure, traveling to Berlin and Prague for these events provided valuable opportunities for us to present our ideas and progress to the public and get feedback on where we\u2019re at.

But only after a team from Washington DC (and elsewhere) took the initiative to build a working demo did the story crystalize into action. We hope that team builds a\u00a0real\u00a0business\u00a0around\u00a0their\u00a0original\u00a0work, so that agile teams like ours can be their customers.The StoryHere\u2019s the thing. Everyone on our team was tired of the old way of getting recognized and rewarded for work. You have to either suck up to a boss or win some kind of sick popularity contest to secure your place, get your bonus, and maybe get cut in for equity in the venture.Then someone got the clever idea to turn our daily scrum into a tool for getting paid.Early on, we figured out that if we were faithfully adding our *Yesterday* and *Today* work to a Slack Channel called \u201cDaily Scrum\u201d, we didn\u2019t need to have an actual standup meeting\u2026so long as everyone read it.Now, thanks to Hey!Pie, a cool Slack App plugin, none of us would miss reading the scrum unless we were literally in a coma. Why? Because it\u2019s how we get Pie. Hey!Pie transforms our Slack scrum channel into a real-time, organic feedback and reward mechanism that relies entirely on \u201cinflation economics.\u201dHere\u2019s how it works:In my daily scrum post, I can add \u201c/pie\u201d and then a number like \u201c#100,\u201d followed by a description of something I accomplished. I can also include a link to a GitHub pull request or any other URL where evidence of my awesomeness on this \u201ckey result\u201d lives.When I hit enter, everyone on my team gets a Slack message showing my /pie proposal: \u201c@John proposes they get 100 Pie for publishing the Hey!Pie story to Medium yesterday.\u201d And there is a field right under the message where one must enter a number, which defaults to the figure I entered (100 in this case).If the others enter a number smaller than I proposed, they are effectively limiting the inflation of our \u201cPie\u201d, which our team will use to calculate our bonuses and equity later. And they\u2019re essentially giving me tacit feedback about their opinion of either the quality of my work or how important they think that work is to our success.If they enter a bigger number, they are saying, \u201cDude, you are too modest\u2026this work is awesome, and I\u2019m happy to dilute my Pie to reward you\u2026here\u2019s 150.\u201dWhen everyone has entered their Pie Awards, Hey!Pie takes the weighted average and adds it to my share of the Pie\u2026depositing Pie tokens into my Ethereum\u00a0wallet.Bonus PieTeams can use Hey!Pie to share out any number of reward schemes, from base pay to crypto to venture equity. The calculation is the same. At the end of a predefined period, an ethereum smartcontract fires and runs this equation: (n/N)*P, where n=the number of Pie shares I accumulated, N=the total number of Pie shares my team awarded to each other, and P=the total amount of whatever pool of value we are playing for in this context (Bonus, Equity\u2026actual Pies!).If P is funded in cryptocurrency, then blockchain does it\u2019s magic, and we all get our Ether or ERC20 tokens or whatever instantaneously.But in our current case, we are using this Hey!Pie channel to determine our quarterly bonuses. We aren\u2019t sales people, and merit bonuses are traditionally tricky for people like us\u2026and they usually come down to how well you are liked by the boss. But with Hey!Pie, every day on Scrum we inched along to our respective bonuses, and if you were in danger of not getting a very good one, you saw it coming a mile off. No surprises.The inflation game works well, because we know two things every time we award each other with Pie: 1) That the award comes at a cost of diluting our overall Pie; 2) Smaller slices of a bigger Pie is more pie. So if someone does something hugely awesome for the team, and we give them a lot of Pie, then we believe that the contribution is likely to increase P.In our Bonus case here in the USA, we are paid in old fashioned dollars. So our finance people have to take our Pie holdings in a report that Hey!Pie generates and pay us out the traditional way ..but at least we have an immutable record of our legal right to that Pie. (And we all signed a OpenLaw contract that is a legal agreement governing the payout terms both in a court of law and in the blockchain smart contract.) So now the finance team simply has to decide how big that value for P will be. And for that, it\u2019s pretty handy that the Hey!Pie report summarizes all our key results against OKRs. This gives them data-driven reasons for maybe pumping up that Bonus pool!Setup is KeyHey!Pie has a web-based control panel, which made it easy for our team to set up governance for our Pie. The first thing we set was a \u201ctarget\u201d amount of pie. This figure shows up in Slack as an alert if we have given each other more slices of Pie than that, so that we can keep an eye on inflation. And we can see how close we\u2019re coming to the max value by looking at the figure posted in each Slack message prompting us to Award Pie to someone. This gives us a sense of the \u201cprice\u201d of awarding each other more Pie.The control panel also let us set up who gets to award Pie (both inside our work team and others we want to have a say in our reward system) and whether anyone has more weight than others in setting the final Pie award for each proposal. This defaults to everyone being equal, and my team kept it that way\u2026except for one Board member that was willing to do the daily Scrum awards\u2026they had a 1.5x weighting.Multiple Pie MakersIt turns out that most of the time, contributions reported on the daily Scrum really are individual, but sometimes the result I\u2019m reporting in my \u201c/pie\u201d post is hard to claim as just my work. In this case, I can add a list in the form \u201c@teammate\u201d after /pie. If I only add a single \u201c#100\u201d, then I\u2019m proposing that everyone get 100 Pie tokens each. But I can add different \u201c#\u201d amounts after each person in order to propose individualized\u00a0awards.This is also handy for awarding our whole team for something like all of us doing an event or meeting.Tipping PieOne of my favorite ways to use Hey!Pie is to just give someone on team some of my Pie. This doesn\u2019t inflate the Pie but it also doesn\u2019t feel the same as it would if I were to show my appreciation in cold hard cash. After all, until the bonus is actually calculated, the amount of Pie I have is in a kind of \u201cSchrodinger\u2019s Cat\u201d state\u2026not quite real yet. Easier to gift.So Much More than Meets the PieThis is a pretty simple application right now, but it is easy to see how Hey!Pie could incrementally add awesome features to make it more and more essential\u2026and not simply for small team self-management but for mesh organizations (and even hierarchies) trying to be more data driven about how they set goals, make decisions and enable people to serve each other.Our team of designers, developers and writers at ConsenSys in Durham, NC writes user experiences \u201cfrom the near future\u201d as a way to explore novel and (we hope) unexpected ways of using web3 technologies to change how people live and how businesses organize themselves.

That\u2019s the key to navigating the emerging technology wilderness. And when it comes to practical applications on the blockchain, that\u2019s what GitWrit is apparently all about:Making it easy for book contributors to earn fractional rights to the future royalties of a book project.The Book ProjectMy friend Ray and I have a great idea for a book, and we happen to have a platform for getting a book noticed by a lot of people. In other words, we have distribution.We also have the chapter outline, framework and a simple style guide for the book, which we did over a weekend using GitWrit. (More on that later.)Help!What we don\u2019t have is time, and our day jobs have us writing whenever we aren\u2019t sitting in meetings. We need help. We need people to write chapters and sections of chapters. We need people to provide facts, anecdotes, examples. We need editors, fact checkers and other validators.And we need an easy way to give compelling incentives for all this help.Being blockchain people, our first thought was to \u201ctokenize\u201d the book. Nice idea for starters, but vague. Then we ran across GitCoin and Bounties, a way for people to earn cryptocurrency for contributing to projects on GitHub. But there\u2019s a catch: We\u2019d have to stake the bounties with cryptocurrency up-front, which means risking money we don\u2019t have on the promise of a book that might never earn a dime.We want to share the risk and reward with contributors, not pay them up front. If we wanted to do that, we could use greenbacks.Tracking Collaboration is ToughThe trouble with collaborative creative projects that share-out royalties to contributors \u2014 books, movies, music \u2014 is that it\u2019s hard to keep track of who-gets-what when the money rolls in.The general problem of royalties is a big one, and maybe GitWrit is onto something in their approach, but right now they\u2019re just about books, which has an extra-special problem: the book industry sucks at managing royalties to many contributors. Publishers don\u2019t want to deal with keeping track and paying out little checks to 100\u2019s of people, and neither do literary agents. Consequently, most books are authored, enhanced, edited and fact-checked by one or two lonely souls.Where GitWrit comes in.The way GitWrit handles each contributor getting paid is something worth mentioning. There are two ways:For the \u201ccrypto-savvy,\u201d it\u2019s simple. You just set up your public key, and when money is deposited into the Trust Fund for the book (more on this below), a smart contract enabled by financial blockchain-startup, Adhara, automatically fires off your share of the royalties.For those who aren\u2019t \u201ccrypto-savvy,\u201d you can set up a debit account with the bank \u2014 the same way a driver does when they start driving for Uber \u2014 and the Trust Fund will transfer money when the total is large enough to be worth the transaction fees.[Which method would you prefer? Vote here.]How it WorksRay and I spent a weekend on the GitWrit site, setting up the book project, giving it a title, writing the chapter outline, and identifying a few key issues where we needed some fact-checking. \u201cIssues\u201d is a keyword in GitWrit. This makes sense, because GitWrit is based on GitHub. Issues is what GitHub calls a request for contribution, and GitWrit really is just a simple Medium-like word-processing front end to a GitHub data repository \u2014 with a few extra tricks on the side.Developers know that GitHub is a distributed version-control forking repository that allows code contributors to propose work as Issues, contribute work as Pull Requests, and choose definitive contributions by Merging. But most writers don\u2019t know any of this stuff, and they don\u2019t want to. So GitWrit hides it all. Instead, writers are presented with chapters and other opportunities to contribute to the book in an outline on the side of their screen. No need to know this is a set of GitHub Issues.Slicing the PieNext to each item in the outline is the amount in tokens that Ray and I are willing to give the contributor whose work we choose to include for that Issue in the final draft. (As Maintainers, we are in total control of which contributions go into the book, so don\u2019t mistake this for a way to do \u201cdecentralized authoring\u201d\u2026that\u2019s a story for another day.)It took Ray and me several hours to decide how many points to put on each one, because each token represents a percentage of the legal rights to the money that the book makes.GitWrit has some nice user interface tools to make the process easier, starting with letting us set how much of the total we want to keep for ourselves. We set that at 50% for starters, but we can change it until the book draft is locked and submitted to the publisher. At that point, no changes \u2014 no take-backs.Linking the Old and the New World of PublishingOnce a book is submitted, GitWrit automatically sets up a Trust Fund and a bank account for the project. This is a real world money asset \u2014 currently only in dollars \u2014 into which the literary agent for the book will send traditional paper royalty checks as the publisher pays them (usually monthly\u2026assuming any revenue actually comes in).Using a fractional Trust fund is a clever way of bridging the old world of publishing and the new world of the blockchain. The tokens that contributors get are a legal right to a certain percentage of the Trust, awarded and enforced by smart contract provided by OpenLaw. It\u2019s a bona fide claim. They can go down to the \u2018old-timey\u2019 bank and extract their share whenever they want, and legally the bank must pay them. But it also allows the Trust to make short work of distributing royalties to many parties.And because it\u2019s a Trust, the book project (and GitWrit) don\u2019t have to worry about holding the contributors\u2019 money in our bank account and getting taxed on the float or risk being regulated as a money transmission service.The Contributor\u2019s WorkflowClicking on an item in the outline, the prospective contributor sees a blank page and a simple word-processing interface\u2026almost as good as Medium. The text is saved to the GitHub repo in Markdown format, but the writer doesn\u2019t need to know anything about that. And when they hit the submit button, GitWrit handles all the complexities of initiating the pull request and committing changes to the branch.Then Ray and I see the contribution, and if we like it, we hit the \u201caccept\u201d button, and automatically the contributor is now the proud owner of some tokens: a share in the Trust representing all future royalties from sales of the book.We call this a story from the \u2018near-future\u2019, not the future-future.In a future-future world, the whole book business would be integrated on a totally pervasive set of blockchains. This is the world of a mature \u201cStateful Internet.\u201d In this world, every time a paper or digital book is purchased, the money flows immediately to each token holder.In a perfect world, the publishers, distributors, booksellers, agents, promoters\u2026everyone\u2026would get their piece of the revenue pie this way \u2014 seamlessly, instantly, and with massively reduced risk of fraud. But that\u2019s a ways off.But for now, GitWrit is using blockchain to register those book tokens on an immutable ledger, in this case the public Ethereum mainnet, and distributing the royalties to contributors that choose to get paid in cryptocurrency.To Sum It UpGitWrit is a pretty nice writer\u2019s interface for collaborative book projects, particularly for projects that expect (or at least hope for) a financial return through traditional print and Amazon-style digital publishing. Is it what we want and need in the coming world of publishing and royalty management on the true blockchain-enabled #statefulInternet? Nope. But it\u2019s a start.Our team of designers, developers and writers at ConsenSys in Durham, NC writes user experiences \u201cfrom the near future\u201d as a way to explore novel and (we hope) unexpected ways of using web3 technologies to change how people live and how businesses organize themselves. Some of these stories we build into beautiful open source (apache2) developer kits, with functional modules that you can use to build your own offerings\u2026 \u2018lego kits\u2019 for web3. Will soon have our own publication, but until then, find our stories on ConsenSys Media, and on John Wolpert\u2019s Medium page.", "responses": 2, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Publishing", "Cryptocurrency", "Finance", "Technology"]}]
